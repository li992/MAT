1.6 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above and in Sections 2 to 5, the Directors are required tomakejudgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions toaccounting estimates are recognised in the period inwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, orinthe period ofthe revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements and key assumptions made by the Directors, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty atthebalance sheet date, that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Oil and gas assets Management assesses the Groups oil and gas assets for indicators ofimpairment at least annually, with reference to indicators in IAS36.
Note 4.4 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets and details of the key assumptions used, which include aproduction prole based on managements best estimate ofproven and probable reserves of the assets, an internal oil price prole benchmarked tomean analysts consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reective of the risks.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets Management assesses impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets with reference to indicators in IFRS 6 and thespecic facts and circumstances of each asset.
Section 4.3 discloses the carrying value of such assets.
In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans towards nding commercial reserves.
Thenature of exploration and evaluation activity issuch that only aproportion of projects are ultimately successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods.
Share-based payments and FHN options Management is required to make assumptions in respect of both the fair value of share-based payments and FHN options in issue, inrespect of the inputs used to calculate thefairvalues ofthese contracts.
Details of these can be found in Sections 5.9 and 3.3.
Decommissioning Provision for environmental clean-up and associated costs depend on the legal requirements at the date of decommissioning, the costs andtiming ofwork and the discount rate to be applied.
Decommissioning provisions are updated each year to reect managements best estimates of future cost estimates and timings.
Taxation and royalties The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation.
Afren calculates the tax charge for the period using the latest information available, taking external advice where necessary, in order to arrive at our best estimate of the final tax position.
Revisions to our tax liabilities either upward or downward may occur as the Groups tax lings and royalties are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.
Our tax charge and estimate of our tax liabilities is disclosed in Section 2.3.

b Deferred taxation Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow allorpart of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply intheperiod when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
i Recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities The Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following: 2012 2011 US$m US$m Property, plant and equipment 351.0 92.8 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 12.5 10.6 Other temporary differences 5.6 2.5 Net deferred tax liability 383.9 124.5 At 1 January 2012 Charge for the year At 31 December 2012 Analysis of movement during the year 2012 US$m US$m US$m Property, plant and equipment 92.8 258.2 351.0 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 10.5 2.0 12.5 Other temporary differences 2.4 3.2 5.6 124.5 259.4 383.9 At 1 January 2011 Charge for the year At 31 December 2011 Analysis of movement during theyear 2011 US$m US$m US$m Property, plant and equipment 36.8 56.0 92.8 Intangible oil and gas assets 39.8 39.8 Decommissioning provision 4.2 6.3 10.5 Other temporary differences 8.9 11.3 2.4 63.5 61.0 124.5 Afren plc 11 0 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued ii Unrecognised deferred tax assets At the balance sheet date the Group also had tax losses primarily arising in the UK of US$141.3 million 2011: US$98.3 million in respect ofwhich adeferred tax asset has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these tax losses could be recovered.
Suchlosses can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group had temporary differences of US$12.5 million 2011: US$2.3 million in respect of share-based payments, property, plant and equipment and pensions in respect of which deferred tax assets have not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence of future taxable profits against which these taxlosses could be recovered.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on undistributed earnings ofsubsidiaries as the largest proportion of dividends would be from subsidiaries where no additional tax would be applied on dividend income.
2.4 Reconciliation of profit after tax to normalised profit after tax Normalised profit after tax is a non-IFRS measure of financial performance of the Group, which in managements view provides a better understanding of the Groups underlying financial performance.
This may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by othercompanies.

The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Afren: specically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups business strategy, both now and in the future and to maximise shareholder value.
The Directors consider that debt and equity are both capital, and managing net debt as disclosed below is the key strategy for managing capital.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and funding requirements a minimum of twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business strategy.
The Groups funding requirements are met through a combination of debt, equity and operational cash ow.
3.1 Net debt and cash ow commitments Key cash ow activity in the period In March 2012, Afren raised US$300 million senior secured notes debt with a seven-year term.
Part of the proceeds has been used to repay the outstanding BNPP VTB credit facility debt which had a carrying amount of US$95.9 million asat31 December 2011.
This facility had been used to fund the acquisition of the Groups interest in the Ain Sifni block in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.

The Group has the following derivatives: Purpose Hedge accounting Okoro commodity synthetic put options a Sets a minimum price for Okoro crude oil production No Ebok commodity deferred put options cash ow hedges b Hedge against the price of crude falling for Ebok eld Yes Put sell and call buy options for FHN shares c Options to buy and sell FHN shares No Business review Operations review Corporate responsibility Corporate governance Financial statements Supplementary information Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 11 5 a Okoro commodity call options The Group receives a minimum amount if the market falls, butreceives a set discount from the market price if the oil price isabove thatminimum.
Thearrangement protects the Group against the risk of a significant fall in the price of crude oil.
These instruments terminated in 2011. b Ebok commodity deferred put options The Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls.
Theseinstruments have been classied as cash ow hedges, withaportion ofthe gains and losses on the instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and the ineffective portion, aswell as any change in time value, recognised in the income statement for each period.
During the period the lossincurred of US$20.0 million 2011: US$10.6 million loss, , relating to these instruments was charged tothe income statement in relation to the change in time value.
c Put and call options for FHN shares The Group has three put and or call option contracts in relation to its associate, FHN.
Two of the option contracts are with equity investors ofFHN and there isalso a call option between Afren and FHN.
The Group recorded a net gain of US$0.2 million 2011: US$8.0 million inrespect of these instruments.
The first option contract with an equity holder of FHN is a put and call option agreement over 7.2 million FHN shares.
The Group entered into this call option on8 October 2010 and it expires on 8 April 2013 and can exercise the call option any time during the 2.5 years over the equity investment.
The investor canexercise their put option for 90 days after the call option expires.
The Group has also granted a put option to an equity investor ofFHN over 15 million FHN shares, exercisable two years after the equity investment.
Theduration of this option is 4 April 2011 to 4 April 2013.
This option will lapse if not exercised within 150 days of this date.
As consideration for providing this put option, FHN granted Afren 30 million call options with a ten-year term, which are subject to certain exercise limitations.
During the year, none ofthese options wereexercised 2011: 6.75 million.
FHN has 135 million of issued ordinary shares asat31 December 2012.

Allother leases are classied as operatingleases.
For a finance lease, an asset and corresponding liability is recognised on the balance sheet.
No asset or liability is recognised for an operatinglease.
Finance leases assets are recognised at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined atthe inception ofthe lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate ofinterest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they aredirectly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on astraight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benets from the lease asset areconsumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern inwhich economic benets from the leased asset are consumed.
Obligations under finance lease The Group has a seven-year lease of a Mobile Offshore Production Unit MOPU and a Floating Storage Ofoading Vessel FSO from Mercator Offshore Nigeria Limited in respect of the production operations of the Ebok eld, offshore Nigeria.
The carrying amount of the Groups lease obligations approximates its fair value.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the effective interest rate was 6% 2011: 6%.

The so called cash box method ofeffecting an issue of shares for cash is commonplace and enabled the Company to issue shares without giving rise to any share premium.
ii Non-cash shares were issued to eligible staff members on maturity of the 2009 LTIP.
3.6 Finance costs Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term ofthe related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised andcharged to the income statement as finance costs over the termof the debt.
Borrowing costs, including interest on loans, which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the costofthose assets, until such time asthe assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Capitalised borrowing costs are amortised in line with the underlying asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

4.0 Oil and gas activities This section shows the assets used to generate the Groups trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result.
Liabilities relating tothe Groups nancing activities are addressed in Section 3.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown in Section 2.3.
On the following pages there are disclosures showing intangible and tangible oil and gas assets, capital commitments, inventories, investments and contingent liabilities.
Other working capital balances are shown in Section 5.
4.1 Licences summary The Group has interests in oil and gas licences at the three different stages of the operational work programme cycle exploration, appraisal and development, and production.
Further details on each licence and the stage of the work programme can be found on pages 40 to 55 and on page 140.
The classications reect the stage of each work programme from an operational perspective as explained further in the Operations review.
The classication within the financial statements may be different due to the criteria for determining when the work programme has moved from exploration intangible oil and gas assets to development and then to production both categories tangible oiland gas assets being different under accounting standards.
Business review Operations review Corporate responsibility Corporate governance Financial statements Supplementary information Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 11 9 4.2 Oil and gas reserves Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves also commonly referred to as 2P reserves, which are dened as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with aspecied degree of certainty toberecoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated asproven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it willbe less.
The Groups commercial reserves as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012 are detailed in the table on page 142 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
These commercial reserves are stated on a working interest basis, and have been prepared in accordance with the denitions and guidelines set forth in the 2007 PRMS approved by the Society of Petroleum Engineers SPE.
The commercial reserves are used in a number of ways in the financial statements: in particular: 1 to assess whether a prospect is commercially viable, and therefore support that the recoverable amount of oil and gas assets bothintangible andproperty, plant and equipment continue toexceed the carrying amount of the assets: and 2 in the calculation of depletion of the property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets.
4.3 Intangible exploration and evaluation assets The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting forintangible exploration and evaluation costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration andevaluation costs are initially capitalised asintangible xed assets in cost centres by eld or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination ofcommerciality of the relevant property.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specic exploration activities.
Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specic to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.

Additions during 2011 included US$415.4 million in respect of the Barda Rash licence in the Kurdistan region of Iraq acquired during theperiod which was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to tangible oil and gas assets following approval ofthe eld development plan by the government.
Additions also included US$168.4 million in respect of the Ain Sifni licence in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
Afren plc 120 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued b Transfer to property, plant and equipment: oil and gas assets Non-current assets are tested for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed therecoverable amount.
Suchtriggering events are dened in IFRS 6 inrespect of exploration and evaluation assets and include the point atwhich determination is made astowhether commercial reservesexist.
If prospects are deemed to be commercially viable on completion ofthe evaluation, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment in single eld cost centres.
Prospects deemed to be commercially viable, and transferred toproperty, plant and equipment during 2012, primarily relate tothe Okoro Field Extension as disclosed in a above.
As part of this assessment in2012, management performed an impairment test upon its Okoro asset, ontransfer from intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
This test compared the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet datewith the expected discounted cash ows from each project.
For the discounted cash ows to be calculated, management used aproduction prole based on its best estimate ofproven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price prole benchmarked tomean analysts consensus and a 10% pre-tax discount rate which, takinginto account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reective of the risks.
Prospects deemed to be commercially viable, and transferred toproperty, plant and equipment during 2011, relate to Barda Rash asdisclosed in a above.
As part of this assessment in 2011, management performed an impairment test upon its Barda Rash asset, ontransfer from intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
For the discounted cash ows to be calculated, management used aproduction prole based on its best estimate ofproven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price prole benchmarked tomean analysts consensus and a 10% discount rate which, takinginto account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reective of the risks.
c Exploration costs written-off If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful on making the above determination as to whether commercial reserves exist, theassociated costs are charged to the income statement.
2012 2011 US$m US$m Exploration costs written off 19.7 1.1 Amounts written off in 2012 primarily relate to well costs in respect of Nunya-1X Keta block Ghana which was plugged and abandoned during the year, and impairments of potentially unrecoverable amounts relating to Nigeria blocks OPL907 & 917, for which the Group iscurrently considering its strategic options 2011: amounts relate to the relinquishment of the Groups interest in Ethiopia Blocks 2 & 6.
4.4 Property, plant and equipment Oil and gas assets Development assets are costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering, andstoring oil and gas.
Examples of these costs are costs incurred togain access to and prepare well locations for drilling: drill and equipment development wells, including cost of platforms and well equipment: acquire, construct, and install production facilities such asease ow lines, separators, treaters, and heaters: and other items as appropriate.
Intangible exploration and evaluation assets are transferred into development assets once the property has proved reserves and adevelopment plan approved by all relevant parties including, where applicable, the Government.
Production assets are those properties which have begun producing.
These assets are typically development properties which are transferred into the production portfolio or through acquisition of asubsidiary.
Once commercial production starts on a development asset, the property is reclassied asaproduction asset and depletion of the property commences.
Other property, plant and equipment assets Other property, plant and equipment comprises the Groups investment in leasehold improvements, xtures and equipment, andcomputer hardware andsoftware: and is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.

a Additions Additions during the year included capital expenditure in respect of the Ebok eld of US$204.4 million and Barda Rash eld of US$121.1 million.
Inaddition, US$68.0 million relating to the Okoro Field Extension was transferred from intangible exploration and evaluation assets to development during the year.
Additions in 2011 included US$168.3 million relating to the MOPU and FSO at Ebok eld, offshore Nigeria, held under finance lease asdisclosed innote3.4.
b Provision for decommissioning A provision for decommissioning the oil and gas assets is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The extent to which aprovision isrequired depends on the legal requirements for decommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to beapplied.
Afren plc 122 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued The provision represents the present value of the decommissioning costs relating to Ebok, Okoro and CI-11 elds that are expected tobe incurred upto2023.
The table below details the movements in the provision.

Theamount recognised is the estimated , discounted to its net present value, andis reassessed each year in accordance with localconditions andrequirements, reecting managements best estimates.
Additions during the year relate to provisions for additional wells drilled at the Ebok eld and Okoro eld.
During 2011 an independent specialist evaluated the decommissioning costs for the three elds and the study led to the adjustment oftheamounts previously provided for.
Management believe the estimates continue to form a reasonable basis for the expected future costs ofdecommissioning, which are expected to be incurred up to 2023.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording anadjustment to the provision and a corresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
c Transfer from development to production Transfers from development to production in the year include a portion of the Okoro Field Extension of US$45.1 million, and in 2011 include Ebok $1,097.3 million.
d Depreciation, depletion and amortisation Oil and gas assets Oil and gas assets are amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves, generally on a eld by eld basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus theestimated future eld development costs.
Changes inthe estimates of commercial reserves or future eld development costs are dealt withprospectively.
The gas plant is depreciated straight line over six and a quarter years.
Included in the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charge during the year is US$32.4 million 2011: US$8.2 million attributable totheassets under finance lease in respect of the Ebok eld.
Other property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost ofthe property, plant and equipment, less anticipated disposal proceeds, ona straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic life as follows: Leasehold improvements over life of lease Fixtures and equipment over three years Computer hardware and software over three years Business review Operations review Corporate responsibility Corporate governance Financial statements Supplementary information Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 123 Impairment Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverableamount.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset bycomparison withthe estimated discounted future net cash ows based on managements expectation of future production, oilprices and costs.
As part of this assessment in 2012, management carried out a review of all property, plant and equipment, oil and gas assets and no impairment indicators were noted 2011: impairment tests carried out on assets in Cte dIvoire and on the Barda Rash asset in the Kurdistan region of Iraq.
These tests compared the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date with the expected discounted cash ows from each project.
For the discounted cash ows to be calculated, management used a production prole based on its best estimate ofproven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price prole benchmarked tomean analysts consensus and a10% pre-tax discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reective ofthe risks.
Any impairment identied is charged to the income statement asadditional depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise toimpairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
4.5 Capital commitments As at 31 December, the Group has committed to the following capital expenditure, but as the related assets have not been received asatthat date, noliability is recognised in the financial statements.

The inventory subject to this swap is recorded at its fair value.
Spare parts and materials inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, directlabour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
The cash ows associated with the purchase of spare parts and materials are classied in investment activities with the oil andgas assets.

Afren plc 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 4.7 Investments Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant inuence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
significant inuence ispresumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Jointventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions.
An interest in an entity where the Group has neither control, jointcontrol nor significant inuence is classied as a financial asset.
The following table details the entities for which the Group accounts for its investment as associates or joint ventures, the percentage investment the Group holds as at 31 December 2012 along with detail of the licences these entities hold: Entity Interest Country licence Associates a : First Hydrocarbon Nigeria FHN 46.7% Nigeria: OML 26 Jointly controlled entities b : Afren Global Energy Resources Limited AGER 50% Nigeria: OPL 907 and OPL 917 Dangote Energy Equity Resources Limited DEER 49% Nigeria & So Tom & Prncipe JDZ: Block 1 Financial assets c : Gasol Plc Gasol 14% UK a Associates The results and assets and liabilities of associates are included intheGroup accounts using the equity method of accounting inaccordance with IAS 28, except when classied as held for sale.
The investment is initially recognised at cost, this being the fair value of the purchase consideration together with the fees and other expenses incurred directly in making the acquisition.
Any excess ofthe cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values ofthe identiable net assets of the investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment aspart of that investment.
Any excess of the Groups share of the fair values ofthe identiable net assets of the investee at the date ofacquisition above thecost of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited inthe income statement in the period ofacquisition.
The carrying amount of the investment in the Group balance sheet issubsequently adjusted each period: 1 by the Groups share of any relevant gains or losses, which are accounted for by a charge or credit to the income statement and anincrease or decrease in the carrying value of the investment accordingly.
This includes any gains arising on non-dilutive, third-party equity investments: and 2 less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Investments in associates and jointly controlled investees are assessed for impairment annually.
Where the investment relates to marketable securities the carrying amount is compared to the fair value at the reporting date and any impairment charge isrecognised in the income statement.
The Group income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profit or loss and other comprehensive income, after any adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date significant inuence commences and until thedate that significant inuence ceases.
The result isdisclosed onone line.
Where the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in that associate, the carrying amount of that interest, including any long-term investments, isreduced to zero, and the recognition offurther losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments onbehalf ofthatinvestee.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest inthe relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision ismade for impairment.
IAS 28 is currently not specic on how changes in an investees net assets that are not the investors share of the investees profit or loss orother comprehensive income, or that are not distributions received are accounted for.
The Groups policy in these circumstances isto recognise these gains orlosses through the income statement when they occur.

FHNalso secured nancing facilities totalling US$280 million to enable it to fully fund the acquisition and its share offuture capital requirements associated with the initial development of the block.
The Group recognised a dilution gain of US$0.8 million 2011:US$14.7 million arising from the Groups proportionate share of the increase in the net asset value of FHNs balance sheet following a third-party equity injection.
The financial information accounted for using the equity method asat 31 December has been taken from the management information ofFHNat that date.
b Jointly controlled entities Entities over which the Group exercises joint control are accounted for using proportional consolidation, under which the Group records itsshare ofrevenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The Groups share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the jointly controlled entities at 31 December 2012 and 2011 andfortheyears then ended, which are included in the Groups financial statements, are as follows: 2012 2011 50% share in AGER 49% share in DEER 50% share in AGER 49% share in DEER US$m US$m US$m US$m Current assets 1.6 1.3 1.5 Non-current assets 25.5 4.7 18.7 27.1 6.0 20.2 Current liabilities 19.3 6.4 12.4 Non-current liabilities 7.8 0.4 7.8 Total Income Total expenses 5.9 0.1 0.1 Loss before and after income tax 5.9 0.1 0.1 Afren plc 126 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued c Gasol In August 2012, the Groups shareholding in Gasol plc reduced to14% 2011: 20.9%.
As Afren plc no longer holds significant inuence over Gasol, itsinvestment in Gasol has been reclassied from an associate to an available for sale AFS financial asset.
TheAFS investment in Gasol is held at fair value with changes infairvalue recorded in the investment valuation reserve.
The gains and losses on both reclassication to an AFS financial asset andsubsequent measurement of the investment have not beenmaterial.

Inour view, these disclosures are less important and or material to the core operations of Afren and as such they have been grouped in section 5.
5.1 Adoption of new and revised standards A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013, and have not been applied in preparing these financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements, except for IFRS9 Financial Instruments, which becomes mandatory for the 2013 financial statements and could impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments and IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements.
With respect to IFRS 10, management continue to assess the likely impact on Afrens accounting for associates and joint ventures.
There are other standards in existence which will be considered once endorsed for use in the EU.

5.4 Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty most commonly acustomer will default on its contractual obligations for example default on invoice payment resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Groups sales are diversied in terms of both region and the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oilcompanies with high credit rating and government organisations in Cte dIvoire and balances due from its partners, the Group does nothave significant exposure to any single counterparty or group ofcounterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit ratingagencies or with governmental guarantee.
The Groups total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2012 was US$766.0 million 2011: US$428.7 million made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables excluding prepayments.
i 5.5 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortisedcost.
When there is evidence that the receivable is not recoverable, it is impaired with a corresponding charge tothe income statement.

Afren plc 128 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued i Underlift and overlift Lifting or offtake arrangements for oil and gas produced in certain of the Groups jointly owned operations are such that each participant may not receive and sell its precise share of the overall production in each period.
The resulting imbalance between cumulative entitlement and cumulative production is underlift or overlift.
Underlift and overlift are valued at market value and included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Movements during an accounting period are adjusted through cost of sales such that gross profit is recognised on an entitlements basis.
5.7 Fair values The financial instruments on the Afren balance sheet are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Set out below is a comparison bycategory ofcarrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments.
The measurement of fair value can sometimes besubjective.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and they are described below: Carrying amount Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 US$m US$m US$m US$m Financial assets Derivative financial instruments level 2 1.6 1.6 Derivative financial instruments level 3 10.4 12.4 10.4 12.4 10.4 14.0 10.4 14.0 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments level 2 12.6 10.3 12.6 10.3 Derivative financial instruments level 3 5.4 7.6 5.4 7.6 Borrowings Ebok RBL 184.6 213.4 179.2 229.0 Borrowings BNPP VTB credit facility 95.9 100.3 Borrowings Socar 49.6 48.9 49.7 47.5 Loan notes 779.1 481.7 988.6 527.4 1,031.3 857.8 1,235.5 922.1 Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade creditors, other creditors and accruals and deferred consideration and payables on acquisitions have been excluded from the above analysis as their fair values are equal to the carrying values.
Level 2 fair values are measured using inputs other than quoted prices from active markets that are observable for the asset or liability either directly orindirectly.
Okoro commodity call options and Ebok commodity deferred put options are valued using the forward oil pricecurve.
Level 3 fair values are measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The FHN options, whose valuation requires assumptions regarding FHNs share price which is not readily available, are valued using a Black Scholes model.
One of the option arrangements alsoincorporates a Monte Carlo model over the exercise prole.
In 2012, the only movement in level 3 financial instruments was an increase in the option valuation of US$0.2 million recorded as a gain inthe income statement.
In 2011, the only movement in level 3 financial instruments was the exercise of 6.8 million options resulting in areduction in value ofUS$3.1 million and an increase in the option valuation of US$8.0 million recorded as a gain in the income statement.
The fair value of bank borrowings including loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash outows relating to the borrowings.
Senior loan notes have been discounted at 12%-13%.
All other borrowings have been discounted at 10%.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions does not change the fairvalue signicantly.
5.8 Sensitivity analysis Interest rate risk The risk of the Group being adversely affected by a 1% change ininterest rates was not material in 2012 or 2011.
Oil price risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in oil price relates primarily to the Groups derivative financial instruments.
The terms ofthe derivative financial instruments are such that the Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive asetdiscount from the market price if the oil price isabove that minimum.
The effect on Group loss and equity of changes in the oilprice on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments isas follows: Business review Operations review Corporate responsibility Corporate governance Financial statements Supplementary information Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 129 Positive adverse 2012 Positive adverse 2011 US$m US$m Increase in oil price by 10% 19.4 16.5 Decrease in oil price by 10% 8.6 18.8 Foreign exchange risk The impact of a 10% change in the sterling or the Nigerian Naira toUS dollar exchange rate was not material in 2012 or 2011.
5.9 Staff costs 2012 2011 The average monthly number of employees including Executive Directors employed was as follows: Administration 55 48 Professional 261 224 316 272 Their aggregate remuneration comprised: 2012 2011 US$m US$m Wages and salaries 46.2 40.3 Share-based payments a 15.0 13.4 Social security costs 7.6 1.0 Pension costs b 2.5 2.1 71.3 56.8 A proportion of the Groups staff costs shown above are recharged to the Groups joint venture partners and a proportion is capitalised into the cost ofintangible and tangible oil and gas assets under the Groups accounting policy for exploration, evaluation and oil and gas assets.
The amount ultimately remaining in the income statement was US$28.6 million 2011: US$25.1 million.
Details of Directors remuneration are provided in the part of the Directors remuneration report described as having been audited.
a Share-based payments A transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment where theGroup receives services from employees, Directors or other third parties and pays forthese in shares or similar equity instruments.
The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Directors.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period to exercise, basedon the Groups estimate of shares that willeventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employers National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price.
This expense isaccrued by reference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments made to employees of subsidiaries of the Company are recharged to the relevant subsidiary when awarded.
The share-based payments expense comprises the following three schemes: 2012 2011 US$m US$m Equity-settled share option scheme i 5.0 5.7 Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share award scheme ii 10.0 7.6 Share Award Scheme equity-settled share award scheme iii 0.1 15.0 13.4 i Equity-settled share option scheme The Group operates a share option scheme for employees.
TheGroups policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter.
Options are issued at market price on thegrant date and have vesting periods of up to three years.
Theoptions expire after ten years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion ofthe Board.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2012 was 129p 2011: 158p.
In 2012 options were granted on 3 January, 28 March, 2 and 23 April, 4, 12, 18 and 30 June, 22 August, 2, 23 and 30 October, 6 and 27 November and 7 December.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$1.3million.
In 2011 options were granted on 5 January, 31 March, 9, 20 and 31 May, 21 June, 31 August, 1, 19 and 20 September, 4 October, 22 November and 5December.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$3.5 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year.
Theinputs into the Barrier model were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price pence 129.9 89.5 Weighted average exercise price pence 181.0 131.4 Weighted average target price before eligibility to exercise barrier pence 181.0 135.3 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 4% 4% Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, and over several time periods.
These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which isin line with the prior year.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the form of options in 2012 of US$5.0 million, of which US$5.0 million related to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group 2011: US$5.7 million, ofwhich US$5.7 million related to employees, including Executive Directors, of the Group.
ii Long Term Incentive Plan: Afren Performance Share Plan equity-settled share award scheme Under the Afren Performance Share Plan, the Group also gives awards to Directors and staff subject tooutperforming acomparator group of similarly focused oiland gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period and based upon a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after athree-year period and the full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oiland gas companies, which for the 2012 award was as follows: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Apache Corporation, Cairn Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, DNO, Dragon Oil, Genel Energy, Gulfsands Petroleum, Hess Corporation, Heritage Oil, JKX Oil & Gas, Lundin Petroleum, Marathon Oil Corporation, Maurel et Prom, Melrose Resources, Nexen, Niko Resources, Noble Energy, PA Resources, Pioneer Natural Resources, Premier Oil, Salamander Energy, SOCO International, Talisman Energy, Tullow Oil, Vaalco Energy and Woodside Petroleum.
If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, noshares will be awarded.
At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile performance where only a percentage of the total award will vest.
A second performance target was applied to the 2012 award relating to the Groups Reserves Replacement Ratio RRR, setting a target RRR of 105% over the three-year vesting period of the awards.
Inthe event that a ratio of less than 105% is achieved then the overall award amount is reduced pro-rata.
Business review Operations review Corporate responsibility Corporate governance Financial statements Supplementary information Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 131 Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances, e. g. redundancies, where the number ofawards vesting will be pro-rated according tothe length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.
Details of the share awards outstanding are as follows: 2012 2011 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of the year 23,754,101 0.01 21,310,821 0.01 Granted during the year 16,226,772 0.01 7,887,532 0.01 Exercised during the year 11,240,276 0.01 1,327,604 0.01 Forfeited during the year 856.009 0.01 4,116,648 0.01 Outstanding at end of the year 27,704,588 0.01 23,754,101 0.01 Exercisable at end of the year 0.01 0.01 The awards outstanding at the end of 31 December 2012 have aweighted average remaining contractual life of 2.3 years 2011:2.3 years and an exercise price of 0.01 2011: 0.01.
The aggregate of the fair value of the options granted during theyear ended 31 December 2012 was US$12.8 million 2011:US$9.2 million.
The fair values were calculated using a stochastic model.
The inputs used for fair valuing awards granted during the two periods were asfollows: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price pence 98.0 158.6 Weighted average exercise price pence 1.0 1.0 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
