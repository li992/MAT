This involves bogus stockbrokers, usually based overseas, cold calling people to: pressure them into buying shares that promise high returns: or offer to buy their shares at an inflated price claiming that there is a secret takeover or merger.
This is followed by a request for an upfront cash bond to commit to the deal.
in reality, the shares or secret information are either worthless or non-existent and if you receive such a call, we strongly recommend that you seek independent investment advice from an FsA authorised adviser before you take any action.
if you are concerned that you may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FsA consumer Helpline on 0845 606 1234, www.
