Tax continued 12 b Income tax recognised in the SOCI 2012 2011 m m Current tax Taken to retirement benefit obligations reserve 7.0 18.0 Deferred tax Relating to cash ow hedges 4.5 8.8 Taken to retirement benefit obligations reserve 18.4 32.7 29.9 5.9 The income tax expense for the year is based on the blended UK statutory rate of corporation tax for the period of 24.5% 2011: 26.5%.
The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012, which was enacted on 26 March 2012.
In addition, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, which was enacted on 17 July 2012.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
The UK Government has also indicated that it intends to reduce the main tax rate down to 21% in April 2014.
We estimate that the future rate changes would further reduce the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.
