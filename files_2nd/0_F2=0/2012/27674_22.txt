AOP is a measure of profitability which adjusts the standard IFRS profit measures for the specific items detailed in note C1, and as such it is a non-GAAP measure.
122 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business This reconciliation explains the differences between adjusted operating profit and profit after tax as reported under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
For core life assurance and general insurance businesses, AOP is based on a long-term investment return, including investment returns on life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For the US Asset Management business it includes compensation costs in respect of certain long-term incentive schemes defined as non-controlling interests in accordance with IFRS.
For all core businesses, AOP excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of acquisition accounting, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, profit loss on acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, and fair value profits losses on certain Group debt movements but includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Old Mutual Bermuda is treated as a non-core operation in the AOP disclosure, and Nordic, which is disclosed as discontinued operations for IFRS reporting, is also treated as a non-core operation for AOP disclosure.
Non-core operations are not included in AOP.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as AOP.
It is stated after tax attributable to AOP and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.
