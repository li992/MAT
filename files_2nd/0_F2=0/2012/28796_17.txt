In March 2012 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the UK Corporation Tax rate would be reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012 and by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The 24% rate of tax for future periods was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012.
The impact of these changes to the main rate have been reflected in the deferred tax balance as at 31 March 2012.
8. Dividend Year ended 31 March Year ended 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 Pence Pence per share per share million million Dividends paid in year 4.0 4.0 6.2 6.2 The above amounts were paid as distributions to equity holders in the relevant periods.
The Directors proposed an interim dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 March 2012 of 4.0p per share, which was paid on 19 August 2011 to shareholders on the register at 5 August 2011 and amounted to 6.2 million.
The Board recommends the payment of a dividend of 28.0p per share payable on 24 August 2012 to shareholders on the register at 15 June 2012.
This consists of a proposed final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2012 of 8.0p and an interim dividend in respect of the 9 months ending 31 December 2012 of 20.0p.
The latter is contingent on shareholders approval of appropriate changes to the Companys Articles of Association at the AGM and the Directors confirming such interim dividend is payable at the AGM.
In aggregate the 28.0p dividend will reduce the Companys distributable reserves by approximately 43 million, of which 12.3 million will be charged against the Companys revenue reserve.

The Group does not hold more than 50% of the voting rights of any of its investee companies or partnerships.
As such, holding more than 50% of a particular class of shares does not give the Group control of any of the investee companies or partnerships within the meaning of IAS 27.

Bank Loans 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 Group Company Group Company million million million million Unsecured loans payable within one year: US dollar 400 million three-year credit facility 250.1 250.1 249.0 249.0 Total bank loans and overdrafts 250.1 250.1 249.0 249.0 On 22 December 2010 the Company signed a three-year US dollar 400 million credit facility with National Australia Bank.
The facility was drawn in full on 6 January 2011.
While the facility may be drawn under terms flexible as to amount and timing, any amounts borrowed must contractually be repaid within three months and therefore is disclosed within current liabilities even though the loan is viewed as providing medium-term structural gearing.
The facility pays variable interest linked to three-month US dollar LIBOR.
Following the drawdown, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps with the effect of fixing the interest rate at an average of 3.43% until December 2013.
No bank loans were held within subsidiaries, 31 March 2011: nil.

Provisions in respect of investments include 0.9 million 31 March 2011: 2.0 million which are expected to settle within the next twelve months.
It is anticipated that all of the other provisions noted above will be settled more than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Indemnity provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2012 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been calculated by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
In respect of segregated accounts where performance criteria have been exceeded at the end of the year, the value of the associated performance fee payable to the manager has been provided for under current liabilities.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.1 million as at 31 March 2012 31 March 2011: 0.3 million.
Long-term incentive plan The opening provision represented amounts accrued under long-term incentive arrangements accounted for as a cashsettled scheme in accordance with IFRS 2.
Following the amendment of the scheme rules on 22 September 2011 the SAR plan was accounted for as an equitysettled scheme, the change in the accounting basis removed the requirement for the Group to hold a cash provision for future expected payments.
For further details please refer to the share-based payments accounting policy set out on page 47 and the information provided in notes 25 and 26.

The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 20% 31 March 2011: 20%, dividends of 4.0p 31 March 2011: 4.0p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate based on the Sterling Benchmark Swap Curve.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 24.
To allow for the effects of early exercise and staff turnover, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised four and a half years after the relevant grant dates.

Under the terms of the Companys existing Articles of Association, sums standing to the credit of the capital reserve are available for distribution only by way of redemption or purchase of any issue of the Companys own shares.
Following changes in the tax rules for investment companies and statute, the Company is planning to amend its Articles to allow distribution by dividends of realised capital reserves.
The Company may only distribute accumulated realised profits.
In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales TECH 01 08 realised capital reserves comprise gains and losses on realisation of investments together with changes in fair value of investments which are considered to be readily convertible into cash without accepting adverse terms.
At the year-end all of the listed investments were considered to be sufficiently liquid to be regarded as readily convertible into cash, however the unlisted investments were not.
Accordingly, the split of capital reserve between realised and unrealised in order to determine distributable realised profits was as follows: Year ended 31 March 2012 Year ended 31 March 2011 Group Company Group Company million million million million Capital reserve distributable in respect of investments sold 1,466.0 1,452.9 1,527.1 1,513.9 in respect of listed investments held 59.6 59.1 81.2 81.0 Capital reserve non-distributable 141.2 128.1 125.1 111.7 Balance at year-end 1,666.8 1,640.1 1,733.4 1,706.6 62 Annual Report and Accounts March 2012 RIT Capital Partners plc | Overview | Business Review | Governance | | Other Information | Financial Statements 224233 RIT R&A pp50-pp87 31 05 2012 22:04 Page 63 Notes to the Financial Statements 23.

Financial Instruments As an investment company, financial instruments make up the vast majority of the Groups financial position and generate its performance.
The Group holds investments in a variety of financial instruments in order to meet its investment objective to deliver long-term capital growth while preserving shareholders capital.
Asset allocation is determined by the Executive Directors under the authority of the Board.
The assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares, partnership interests and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives.
The investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss FVPL : cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: long-term borrowings used to enhance returns: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group in accordance with the Groups investment objectives, and to manage market risks and currency risks.

In relation to receivables, payables and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 March 2012 this amounted to 250.1 million 31 March 2011: 249.0 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during 2012 or 2011 by the Group or the Company.
28.2 Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by the executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, and is described in more detail below.
68 Annual Report and Accounts March 2012 RIT Capital Partners plc | Overview | Business Review | Governance | | Other Information | Financial Statements 224233 RIT R&A pp50-pp87 31 05 2012 22:05 Page 69 Notes to the Financial Statements The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.
Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three types of risk: Price risk b. below The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest rate risk c. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency risk d. below The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective and the investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
Exposure to any one entity is monitored by the Executive Directors and senior management.
The Company has complied with the requirement of the relevant tax legislation for an investment trust not to invest more than 15% of the total value of its investments in the securities of any one group at the time of the initial acquisition, or subsequent purchase.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets and currencies by taking positions in currency forward contracts, index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those currencies or particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The Executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to price risk and take appropriate action to mitigate the risk.
The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
The performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to price risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including relevant derivatives, as set out below: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 million million Exposure to price risk 1,959.4 1,920.6 RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts March 2012 69 224233 RIT R&A pp50-pp87 31 05 2012 22:05 Page 70 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.
Financial Instruments continued As at the year-end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 102.1% of net assets 31 March 2011: 96.8%.
Price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS with regards to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into including those to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 March 31 March 2012 2011 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 195.9 192.1 c. Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities: Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Credit funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups other investments including in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of interest rate risk The Executive Directors continually monitor the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as a hedge of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to interest rate risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.
31 March 2012 31 March 2011 Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Rate Rate Total Rate Rate Total million million million million million million 1 Portfolio investments debt securities 27.9 97.9 125.8 33.6 248.2 281.8 Derivative financial instruments 4.6 4.6 1.4 1.4 Cash 75.1 75.1 65.6 65.6 Bank loans and overdrafts due within one year 250.1 250.1 249.0 249.0 Total Exposure 103.0 156.8 53.8 99.2 2.2 97.0 1 The Group also holds 135.0 million 2011: 19.9 million in credit funds, which hold assets subject to fair value impact due to interest rate changes.
These provide indirect exposure to interest rate risk.

Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
The Group has total borrowings of 250.1 million outstanding at the year-end 31 March 2011: 249.0 million.
The credit facility comprising this total incurs fixed interest payments through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and profit and loss in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 200 basis point annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities are not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant The Group has direct exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on the valuation and cash flows of its interest bearing assets and liabilities.
However, it may also be indirectly affected by the impact of interest rate changes on the earnings of certain companies in which the Group invests, and the impact on valuations that use interest rates as an input, such as valuation models for unquoted investments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis may not reflect the full effect on the Groups net assets.
A 200 basis point decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 March 31 March 2012 2011 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 2.1 2.0 d. Currency risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of currency risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US dollar investments is also hedged by way of the Companys borrowings denominated in this currency.

Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS in regard to changes in key currencies is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% strengthening of Sterling relative to the foreign currencies as at 31 March, and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% weakening is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the net foreign currency assets held at the balance sheet dates and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.

Credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of credit risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Using a large number of brokers Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to highly rated government securities A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if the counterparty were unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group has exposure to certain debt instruments acquired as part of its private equity transactions.
The credit risk associated with these instruments is managed as part of the overall investment risk in the relevant portfolio companies and is not considered separately.

No defaults noted as trading counterparties.
Substantially all of the listed portfolio investments are held by Bank of New York Mellon as custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Groups rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed: however, the custodians local long-term rating from S&P was AAin the most recent rating prior to 31 March 2012. f. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in and commitments to unquoted companies and unquoted funds which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to be realised.
Management of liquidity risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.

Financial Instruments continued Exposure to liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.
The Group has a credit facility totalling 250.1 million details of which are disclosed in Note 18.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities at the year-end, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required are as follows: 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 3 months 3-12 3 months 3-12 or less months 1 year Total or less months 1 year Total million million million million million million million million Current liabilities: Bank loan overdraft 250.1 250.1 249.0 249.0 Derivatives 13.8 13.8 25.9 25.9 Other liabilities 12.9 12.9 17.8 17.8 Non-current liabilities: Derivatives 4.7 4.7 1.0 1.0 Total 276.8 4.7 281.5 292.7 1.0 293.7 Commitments 137.7 137.7 145.8 145.8 Total 414.5 4.7 419.2 438.5 1.0 439.5 28.3 Collateral Collateral is posted by the Group in relation to derivative transactions.

The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to the derivatives terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

These are as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs level 3 The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
Where adjustments have been required to quoted prices to arrive at fair value, or where a market price is available but the market is not considered active, the Directors have classified these investments as level 2.
The Directors consider all unquoted direct investments and unquoted funds as described on page 9 of the Investment Directors Review as level 3 assets, as the valuations of these assets are not based on observable market data.
Where funds within the absolute return & credit and real asset categories invest into illiquid stocks, these are also considered by the Group to be level 3 assets.

All these conditions were met during this and the previous financial year.
In addition, one of the Companys subsidiaries is subject to capital requirements imposed by the Financial Services Authority and that subsidiary must ensure that it has sufficient capital to meet the requirements as set out by the Financial Services Authority.
The subsidiary was in compliance with those capital requirements throughout the year.

Pension Commitments JRCM has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme consists of a defined benefit section which is closed to new members.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Under IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 March 2013, will be 1.1 million 31 March 2012: 0.8 million.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary, this resulted in an increase of contributions payable of 0.3 million.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following tables: At At 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 Discount rate 5.15% 5.55% Rate of increase in salaries 3.00% 3.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued before 5 April 1997 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued after 6 April 1997 4.30% 4.25% Inflation assumption Retail Price Index 3.20% 3.50% The mortality assumptions employed as at 31 March 2012 for active and deferred members are based pre-retirement mortality assumptions of AM FC00.
Post retirement assumptions for active members, deferred members and pensioners are based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS light series year of birth table and includes allowance for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the Actuarial Professions Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI projections with a long term trend of 1.5% per annum long term trend.
It is assumed that 80% of members are married as at the date of death, 31 March 2011: 70%.
As at 31 March 2012, the expected rate of return on the Schemes assets was 7.2% per annum 31 March 2011: 8.3% per annum.
This rate is equal to the weighted average of the long-term expected rates of return on each of the asset classes in which the Scheme was invested in at 31 March 2012.
The fair value of the assets held by the defined benefit scheme, the long-term expected rate of return on each class of assets and the value of the Schemes liabilities assessed on the assumptions described above are shown in the following table: Long-term Long-term rate of return Value at rate of return Value at expected at 31 March expected at 31 March 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 2012 million 2011 million Equities 8.00% 9.6 9.00% 11.2 Alternative investments 6.00% 1.6 7.00% 2.8 Corporate bonds 4.00% 1.9 5.00% 1.0 Cash 2.00% 0.1 2.00% 0.2 Fair value of the Schemes assets 13.2 15.2 Present value of the Schemes liabilities 14.5 14.7 Surplus deficit in the Scheme 1.3 0.5 The deficit of the Scheme for the year ended 31 March 2012 was 1.3 million 31 March 2011: surplus 0.5 million.
