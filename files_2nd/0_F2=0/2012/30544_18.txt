Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and performance, are set out in the Business Review section of the Directors Report on pages 7 to 17.
The financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2012 is shown in the balance sheet on page 45.
The cash flows of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012, which are not untypical, are set out on page 46.
The Company had fixed debt and preference share capital totalling 110,316,000, as set out in note 13 on page 57: none of the borrowings is repayable before 2016.
In 2012, the Group renewed a one year secured multi-currency borrowing facility for 50 million, of which 21 million was drawn down at 31 December 2012 2011: 15 million.
Note 14 on pages 57 to 64 sets out the Groups risk management policies and procedures, including those covering currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
As at 31 December 2012 the Groups total assets less current liabilities exceeded its total non current liabilities by a multiple of over ten.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 12.
Most of these securities are readily realisable even in volatile markets.
The directors, who have reviewed carefully the Groups budget and forecast for the coming year, consider that the Group has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiary to bring the accounting policies used by it into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
d Presentation of the Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
In accordance with the Companys Articles of Association, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 formerly section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. e Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no ex-dividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and shortterm deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
Stock lending fees and underwriting commission are recognised as earned.
Any special dividends are looked at individually to ascertain the reason behind the payment.
This will determine whether they are treated as income or capital.
Where the Group has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
47 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued f Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fees and finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital to reflect the Boards expectations of longterm investment returns.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reflecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
g Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Statement of Comprehensive Income then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
h Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are defined by IFRSs as adopted by the European Union as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All gains and losses are allocated to the capital return within the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
The subsidiary company, Witan Investment Services Limited, is held at fair value in the Company balance sheet.
This is considered to be the net asset value of the shareholders funds, as shown in its balance sheet.
i Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
j Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
48 Annual Report 2012 1 Accounting policies continued k Non current liabilities All debentures and secured bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with the interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future payments over the expected life of the financial liabilities, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
l Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and allocated to the capital return.
m Adoption of new and revised accounting standards i Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
ii Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes The Group has applied the amendments to IAS 12 December 2010 titled Deferred tax: Recovery of underlying assets.
The amendments provide a practical approach for measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets when investment property is measured using the fair value model in IAS 40 Investment Property.
The amendments introduce a presumption that an investment property is recovered entirely through sale.
This presumption is rebutted if the investment property is held within a business model whose objective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, rather than through sale.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 1 amended Government Loans IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2009 2011 Cycle IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment entities amended IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows: IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments: IFRS 13 will impact the measurement of fair value for certain assets and liabilities as well as the associated disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review has been completed.
49 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued n Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts appropriate to sections of the portfolio to provide additional market exposure or to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the investment managers longer-term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Hedge accounting is not used.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2011: nil.
d Factors that may affect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 27,727,000 2011: 26,362,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
53 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 8 Dividends 2012 2011 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 6.55p 2010: 6.50p per ordinary share 12,589 12,654 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 6.0p 2011: 5.45p per ordinary share 11,414 10,487 24,003 23,141 includes a write-back of 17,000 2011: 31,000 of dividends unclaimed for 12 years or more Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 7.2p 2011: 6.55p per ordinary share 13,665 12,589 The second interim dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements as it was declared after the year end.
Total in respect of the year: Set out below is the total dividend to be paid in respect of the year.
This is the basis on which the requirements of section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are considered.
2012 2011 000 000 Revenue profits available for distribution 27,723 25,679 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 6.0p 2011: 5.45p per ordinary share 11,414 10,487 Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 7.2p 2011: 6.55p per ordinary share 13,665 12,589 Revenue retained for the year 2,644 2,603 9 Earnings loss per ordinary share The earnings loss per ordinary share figure is based on the net profit for the year of 146,278,000 2011: loss of 109,295,000 and on 191,174,313 ordinary shares 2011: 193,509,347, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The earnings loss per ordinary share figure detailed above can be further analysed between revenue and capital, as below.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share.
Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.
iii Gains losses on investments held at fair value though profit or loss 2012 2011 000 000 Realised gains on sales of investments 23,435 40,019 Movement in investment holding gains 107,976 163,475 Net movement on foreign exchange on cash and cash equivalents 1,198 688 130,213 124,144 iv Substantial share interests The Company has notified interests in 3% or more of the voting rights of five of the investee companies, all of which are closed-ended investment funds.
However, the Board does not consider any of the Companys investments to be individually material in the context of these financial statements.
It is the Companys stated policy to invest no more than 15% of its gross assets in other listed investment companies including listed investment trusts.

The holding is valued on the basis of an independently determined price set within Cazenove Capital Holdings in 2012 for matching internal buyers and sellers, discounted to reflect illiquidity.
The directors consider this price to be supported by information about the companys business over the remainder of 2012.

Secured Bonds due 2025, net of discount and issue costs totalling approximately 2,000,000.
The discount and the issue costs will be written back over the life of the Secured Bonds.
The nominal value of the remaining Secured Bonds in issue 64,290,000 at 31 December 2012 is redeemable on 15 December 2025.
The nominal value of the Debenture Stock is redeemable on 1 October 2016.
The Debenture Stock and the Secured Bonds are secured by floating charges over all the undertaking and assets of the Company.
The security of the charges applies pari passu to both issues.
14 Financial instruments Risk management policies and procedures As an investment company, Witan invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objective as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to manage the risks, as set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period, although in some instances additional resources have been allocated to some areas.
14.1 Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises: price risk see note 14.2, currency risk see note 14.3 and interest rate risk see note 14.4.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, which policies have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2011.
The investment managers assess the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitor the overall level of market risk on the whole of their investment portfolios on an ongoing basis.
14.2 Price risk Price risks ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by regularly reviewing relevant information from the investment managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the managers compliance with their mandates and also whether each mandate and asset allocation is compatible with Witans objective.
When appropriate, Witan has the ability to manage its exposure to risk through the controlled use of derivatives.
57 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 14 Financial instruments continued The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity investments, and on options on indices and investments, was as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,202,076 1,083,393 Concentration of exposure to price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on page 18.
This shows that the greater geographical weighting is to UK companies, with significant exposure also to North America and Continental Europe.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those regions, although an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the value of the shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions and historical trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable, given that most of the Groups assets are equity investments.

As a consequence, movements in exchange rates affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The investment managers monitor their exposure to currencies as part of their normal investment processes.
The Board receives a monthly report on the currency exposures of the entire fund.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling upon receipt.
The Group does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 December are shown on page 59.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the Groups equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro and Japanese yen.
The results of these example calculations are significant but not unreasonable in the context of the majority of the Groups assets being invested overseas.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US dollar - 15% 2011: 15% Euro - 15% 2011: 15% Japanese yen - 15% 2011: 15% The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at the balance sheet date and takes account of any forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.
If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2012 2011 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 1,175 828 61 583 1,050 131 Capital return 44,245 23,480 2,380 38,603 22,708 2,544 Change to the profit after tax 45,420 24,308 2,441 39,186 23,758 2,675 Change to the shareholders funds 45,420 24,308 2,441 39,186 23,758 2,675 59 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 14 Financial instruments continued If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: 2012 2011 US$ Euro Yen US$ Euro Yen 000 000 000 000 000 000 Income statement profit after tax Revenue return 868 612 45 431 776 97 Capital return 32,703 17,355 1,759 28,533 16,784 1,881 Change to the profit after tax 33,571 17,967 1,804 28,964 17,560 1,978 Change to the shareholders funds 33,571 17,967 1,804 28,964 17,560 1,978 In the opinion of the directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently, as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Groups objective.
14.4 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions.
The Group holds cash balances, partly to meet payments as they fall due but also when appropriate to offset the long-term borrowings that it has in place.
The Group finances part of its activities through preference shares that do not have redemption dates and through debenture stock and secured bonds that were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December 2012 of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates: when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates: when the financial instrument is due be repaid.
The Groups exposure to floating interest rates on assets is 15,420,000 2011: 22,150,000.
This represents cash holdings minus variable rate borrowing.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on assets is 28,704,000 2011: 26,879,000.
This represents investments in bonds.
The Groups exposure to fixed interest rates on liabilities is 110,316,000 2011: 110,263,000.
This represents fixed rate borrowing.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and loans, is at margin under over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2011: same : the finance charge on the preference shares is at a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% 2011: 3.3% : the finance charge on the debenture stock is at a weighted average interest rate of 8.5% 2011: 8.5% : and the finance charge on the secured bonds is at a weighted average interest rate of 6.125% 2011: 6.125%.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, long-term debt is partially redeemed and as the level of cash balances varies during the year.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the exposure to interest rate risk is not considered to be material.
Interest rate sensitivity Based on the Groups monetary financial instruments at each balance sheet date, an increase or decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates would decrease or increase revenue return after tax by 623,000 2011: 668,000, capital return after tax by 315,000 2011: 225,000, and total profit after tax and shareholders funds by 308,000 2011: 443,000.
60 Annual Report 2012 14 Financial instruments continued This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as investments are made.
In the context of the Groups balance sheet, the outcome is not considered to be material.
14.5 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has borrowed 44,587,000 by its issue in 1986 of 8 per cent Debenture Stock 2016 and 63,174,000 by its issue in 2000 of 6.125 per cent Secured Bonds due 2025.
The Group is able to draw short-term borrowings of up to the sterling equivalent of 50 million from its secured and committed multi-currency borrowing facility of 50 million with BNP Paribas, London Branch expiring in December 2013.
The Board gives guidance to the investment managers as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain fully invested in normal market conditions.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December 2012, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: 2012 2011 Within Between More than Within Between More than 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 1 year 1 and 5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock 3,790 55,012 3,790 58,802 Secured bonds 3,938 15,751 95,619 3,938 15,751 99,557 Preference shares 83 332 2,555 83 332 2,555 Other creditors and accruals 5,882 5,277 Bank loan 21,000 15,000 34,693 71,095 98,174 28,088 74,885 102,112 The above figures show interest payable over the remaining terms of each instrument.
The figures in the between 1 and 5 years and more than 5 years columns also include the capital to be repaid.
The figures in the more than 5 years columns do not include the ongoing annual finance cost of 83,000.
14.6 Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit standard is reviewed periodically by the investment managers, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
None of the Groups financial liabilities are past their due dates or impaired.

Note 1 h on page 48 sets out the Boards policy for determining the fair values of the unquoted investments.
The directors are of the opinion that changing one or more of those assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change those fair values significantly.
The amount of change in fair value for such investments recognised in the profit or loss for the year was a profit of 120,000 2011: loss of 122,000.
Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.

Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Group are explained in the accounting policies in note 1 h. There were no transfers during the year between Level 1 and Level 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.

Capital management policies and procedures The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern: and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Groups policy is to manage the effective gearing in the portfolio to not normally exceed 20%.
Effective gearing is defined as the difference between shareholders funds and the total market value of the investments including the face value of futures positions expressed as a percentage of shareholders funds.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Chief Executive Officers view on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
63 Witan Investment Trust plc Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 14 Financial instruments continued The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the terms of issue of the Companys debenture stock and secured bonds require the aggregate amount outstanding in respect of borrowings, measured in accordance with the policies used to prepare the annual financial statements, not to exceed a sum equal to the Companys capital and reserves at any time: as a public company, the Company has a minimum issued share capital of 50,000: and in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.

cumulative preference shares: and ii to receive repayment of capital at par in a winding up of the Company but do not confer any further right to participate in profits or assets.
The preference shareholders are entitled to receive notices of general meetings of the Company but are not entitled to attend or vote thereat except on a resolution for the voluntary liquidation of the Company or for any alteration to the objects of the Company as set out in its Articles of Association.
In the event of a poll at a general meeting of the Company, every member of the Company who is present in person or by proxy and who is entitled to vote thereat, whether an ordinary shareholder or, in the circumstances outlined above, a preference shareholder, has one vote for every 1 nominal value of shares registered in their name.
Accordingly, on a poll each ordinary shareholder has one vote for every four shares held.
18 Net asset value per ordinary share The net asset value per ordinary share 581.8p 2011: 516.9p is based on the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares of 1,105,847,000 2011: 994,349,000 and on the 190,079,500 ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2012 2011: 192,367,000.
The movements during the year of the net assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows: 000 Total net assets at 1 January 2012 994,349 Total profit for the year 146,278 Dividends paid in the year on the ordinary shares see note 8 24,003 Buy-backs of ordinary shares 10,777 Net assets attributable to the ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 1,105,847 An alternative net asset value per ordinary share can be calculated by deducting from the total assets less current liabilities of the Company the preference shares, the debenture stock and the secured bonds at their market or fair values rather than at their par or book values.
Details of the alternative values are set out in note 14.7.
The net asset value per ordinary share at 31 December 2012 calculated on this basis is 568.9p 2011: 503.7p.

Rentals are fixed for an average of five years.
22 Subsidiary undertaking The Company has an investment in the issued ordinary share capital of its wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking, Witan Investment Services Limited, which was incorporated on 28 October 2004, is registered in England and Wales and operates in the United Kingdom.
23 Related party transactions disclosures Balances and transactions between the Company and its subsidiary, which are related parties, amounting to 242,000 have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Remuneration of key management personnel The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the company for each of the relevant categories specified in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures is provided in the audited part of the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 40.
Directors transactions Dividends totalling 168,000 were paid in the year in respect of ordinary shares held by the Companys directors.
66 Annual Report 2012 24 Segment Reporting The Group adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments with effect from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are reviewed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer and that are used to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The identification of the Groups reportable segments did not change as a result of the adoption of IFRS 8.
Geographical segments Geographical segments are considered to be the primary reporting segment.
An analysis of investment income by geographical segment is set out in note 2 on page 50.
Analyses of expenses by geographical segment and of profit by geographical segment have not been given as it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way.
An analysis of the investments by geographical segment is set out in note 10 on page 55.
Analyses of the remaining assets and liabilities by geographical region have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.
Business segments Business segments are considered to be the secondary reporting segment.
The Group has two business segments: i its activity as an investment trust, which is the business of the parent company, Witan Investment Trust plc, and recorded in the accounts of that company: and ii the provision of executive and marketing management services and the management of savings schemes, which is the business of the subsidiary company, Witan Investment Services Limited, and recorded in the accounts of that company.

During the year to 31 December 2010, the Company received a further 75,000 in respect of the VAT on investment administration fees incurred between 2004 and 2007.
No further VAT refunds or interest were expected or received during 2011 or 2012.
The write-backs of VAT were allocated between revenue return and capital return according to the allocation of the amounts originally paid.
The 75,000 recognised in 2010 was allocated wholly to the revenue return.
The interest paid by HMRC on the VAT recovered was included in other income.
There remain outstanding claims relating to the period 1996 to 2000 and claims for compound interest from 1990 onwards.
No amounts have been recognised in respect of these claims as it is currently uncertain whether any further amounts will be recovered.
26 Subsequent events Since the year end, the Company has bought back 391,500 of its ordinary shares see also page 26.
Since the year end, the Board has declared a second interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2012 of 7.2p per ordinary share see also page 24 and note 8 on page 54.
