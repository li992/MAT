The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
Impairment testing In order to calculate the recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill, all goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations use risk-adjusted future cash flow projections based on the Groups five-year Integrated Business Plan IBP and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with growth rate assumptions applied.
The IBP process includes the use of historic experience, available government spending data and the Groups order backlog.
Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 6.72% 2011 7.37% adjusted for risks specific to the market in which the cash-generating unit CGU operates, have been used in discounting these projected risk-adjusted cash flows.

The final year growth rate assumption in the value-in-use calculations, after adjusting for assumed 3% inflation, is 0% 2011 0%.
The Group monitors changes in defence budgets on an ongoing basis.
There is continuing uncertainty as to the potential impact of a sequestration or other budget reductions that could result in indiscriminate cuts to US government spending.
The future cash flow projections used in the IBP do not include the potential full impact of a sequestration.
The headroom, calculated as the difference between net assets including allocated goodwill as at 31 December 2012 and the valuein-use calculations, for the CGUs listed above is shown below.
The table also shows the headroom assuming a 1% reduction in the final year growth rate assumption used in the value-in-use calculations.

The majority of the projected cash flows within these CGUs are underpinned by expected levels of primarily UK government spending on defence, aerospace and security, and the Groups ability to capture a broadly consistent market share.
In the case of BAE Systems Detica, the future cash flow projections are based on the expectation of growth in cyber and intelligence, both in the UK and overseas government markets, with increasing demand for products and services in commercial markets.
Impairment goodwill In 2012, the impairment charge of 57m comprises the Safariland 27m and Tensylon 12m businesses disposed of during the year see note 26 and the Commercial Armored Vehicles business 18m, all within the Land & Armaments CGU.
The impairment in respect of the Commercial Armored Vehicles business reflects the agreement to sell the business at a price below its carrying value.
In 2011, the impairment charge of 94m comprised the Safety Products business within the Land & Armaments CGU 60m and Naval Ships 34m.
Impairment intangible assets In 2012, the impairment charge of 29m primarily relates to the Land & Armaments business within the Platforms & Services US reporting segment and includes 21m in respect of the Safariland business disposed of during the year.
In 2011, the impairment charge of 15m related to the Land & Armaments business within the Platforms & Services US reporting segment.

Future changes in tax rates The UK current tax rate was reduced from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
Under the Finance Act 2012, the UK current tax rate will reduce to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013.
The Chancellor has also proposed to reduce further the current tax rate to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014.
This will reduce future current tax charges accordingly.
The reduction from 24% to 23% was substantively enacted before 31 December 2012.
In line with this change, the rate applying to UK deferred tax assets and liabilities has been reduced from 25% to 23%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income statement and partly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Accordingly, both recognised and unrecognised UK deferred tax balances as at 31 December 2012 have been calculated at 23%.
The reduction in the rate from 23% to 21% has not yet been substantively enacted.
If this reduction had been substantively enacted by 31 December 2012, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax asset at that date from 1,362m to 1,282m.
Of this reduction, it is estimated that 10m would have been charged to the consolidated income statement and 70m charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, unrecognised deferred tax assets as at 31 December 2012 would have been reduced from 130m to 123m.

Retirement bene t obligations Pension schemes BAE Systems plc operates pension schemes for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal schemes in the UK and US are funded defined benefit schemes, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes in other countries are primarily defined contribution schemes.
Pension scheme valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19, Employee Benefits, deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit schemes in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit schemes in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries as updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 to assess the deficits of the schemes at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit schemes, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance schemes in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2012.
These schemes were rolled forward to reflect the information at 31 December 2012.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
Principal financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the UK and US schemes UK US 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 % % % % % % Discount rate 4.5 4.8 5.5 4.1 5.0 5.5 Inflation 2.9 2.9 3.4 n a n a n a 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4 3.4 4.4 3.7 4.5 4.5 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 1.8 3.5 1.9 3.4 2.3 3.6 n a n a n a 2 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.3 2.9 2.0 2.9 2.8 3.4 n a n a n a Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.2 5.3 5.3 1 The rate of increase in salaries for the UK schemes is assumed to be 0.5% 2011 0.5% above the Retail Prices Index RPI inflation of 2.9% 2011 2.9%, plus a promotional scale.
From 1 January 2013, employees in the US schemes no longer accrue salary-related benefits.
2 The assumption for the rate of increase for deferred pensions is 2.3% 2011 2.0% in respect of those schemes which refer to the Consumer Prices Index as the relevant measure and 2.9% 2011 2.9% where RPI is the relevant measure.
The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid values of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present values of scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and therefore inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the following tables.
Discount rate assumptions are based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
In the UK, the inflation assumptions are derived by reference to the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds, or advice from the local actuary depending on the available information.
The inflation assumptions are used to derive the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase for deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2012, used the SAPS S1 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of scheme members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the CMI 2010 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used, with an assumed long-term rate of future annual mortality improvements of 1%, for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
The mortality tables used for the US pension arrangements have been updated this year, from the 2012 IRS Static Tables, to the most recently published tables, the 2013 IRS Static Tables.
The mortality tables are projected to 2020 for pensioners and to 2028 for non-pensioners.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK schemes range from 22 to 24 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 24 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65 and, for the main US schemes, 19 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 21 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
In February 2013, with the agreement of the Company, the trustees of the BAE Systems 2000 Pension Plan 2000 Plan entered into an arrangement with Legal & General to insure against longevity risk for the current pensioner population, covering 2.7bn of pension scheme liabilities.
This will reduce the funding volatility relating to increasing life expectancy.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 8.5% in 2013 reducing to 5% by 2020 for pre-retirement and 8.0% in 2013 reducing to 5% by 2019 for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown in the following table.
The full disclosures, as required by IAS 19, are provided in the subsequent information.

On 27 September, 387m was paid out of the Trust into the BAE Systems Pension Scheme Main Scheme and 25m was paid out of the Trust into the 2000 Plan.
In December, the remaining 16m was paid into the Main Scheme.
These payments are included within additional contributions in excess of service cost in the table above.
The Group considers the contributions made to the Trust to be equivalent to the other lump sum contributions it makes into the Groups pension schemes and, accordingly, presents below a definition of the pension deficit including them.

Certain of the Groups equity accounted investments participate in the Groups defined benefit schemes as well as Airbus SAS, the Groups share of which was disposed of in 2006.
As these schemes are multi-employer schemes, the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and Airbus SAS based upon a consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.
In the event that an employer who participates in the Groups pension schemes fails or cannot be compelled to fulfil its obligations as a participating employer, the remaining participating employers are obliged to collectively take on its obligations.
The Group considers the likelihood of this event arising as remote.
When setting the overall expected rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied, and long-term historical relationships between equities and bonds are preserved.
This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

A dividend waiver was in operation for shares within the ESOP Trust, other than those owned beneficially by the participants, for the dividends paid in June and November 2012.
The shares held by the ESOP are recorded at cost and deducted from retained earnings until such time as the shares vest unconditionally to employees.
A dividend waiver was in operation during 2012 and remains over shares within the Companys Share Incentive Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by the participants.
A dividend waiver was also in operation for the dividends paid in June and November 2012 over shares in the Group All-Employee Free Shares Plan Trust other than those shares owned beneficially by participants.
Capital The Group funds its operations through a mixture of equity funding and debt financing, including bank and capital market borrowings.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups capital was 3,782m 2011 4,291m, which comprises total equity of 3,774m 2011 4,299m, excluding amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges of 8m debit 2011 8m credit.
Net cash as defined by the Group was 387m 2011 net debt 1,439m.
The capital structure of the Group reflects the judgement of the directors of an appropriate balance of funding required.
The Groups policy is to maintain an investment grade credit rating and ensure operating flexibility, whilst: meeting its pension obligations: continuing to pursue organic investment opportunities: paying dividends in line with the Groups policy of long-term sustainable cover of around two times underlying earnings see note 8 : making accelerated returns of capital to shareholders when the balance sheet allows: and investing in value-enhancing acquisitions, where market conditions are right and where they deliver on the Groups strategy.

Financial risk management A discussion of the Groups treasury objectives and policies, and the use of financial instruments can be found in the Directors Report.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the price at which one party would assume the rights and or duties of another party.
The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair values of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: and the fair values of loans and overdrafts have been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market-based interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt with derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 50% and a maximum of 90% 2011 75% of gross debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had 79% 2011 63% of fixed rate debt and 21% 2011 37% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 3.0bn, including debt-related derivative financial assets 2011 3.1bn.
Based on contracted maturities and or repricing dates, the following amounts are exposed to interest rate risk over the future as shown below: Between Less than one and More than one year two years two years m m m Cash and cash equivalents 3,355 Loans and overdrafts 647 626 6 The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2012, the Group had a total of $1.0bn 2011 $1.8bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 1.7 years 2011 2.8 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt, the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was 10.1 years 2011 10.4 years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 2.7% 2011 3.1%, 2.7% on US dollars 2011 3.1% on US dollars and 2.5% on sterling.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 5.7% 2011 6.0%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 6m 2011 12m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for shortterm periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 7m 2011 7m.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain adequate undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 2bn 2011 2bn.
The RCF is contracted until 2015 and was undrawn throughout the year.
The RCF also acts as a back stop to Commercial Paper issued by the Group.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had no Commercial Paper in issue 2011 513m.
Cash flow forecasting is performed by the businesses on a monthly basis.
The Group monitors a rolling forecast of its liquidity requirements to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet operational needs and maintain adequate headroom.
Surplus cash held by the businesses over and above balances required for working capital management is loaned to the Groups centralised treasury department.
Surplus cash is invested in interest bearing current accounts, term deposits, money market deposits and marketable securities, choosing instruments with appropriate maturities or sufficient liquidity to provide sufficient headroom as determined by cash forecasts.
Credit risk The Groups objective is to monitor and control counterparty credit risk and credit limit utilisation.
The Group adopts a conservative approach to the investment of its surplus cash.
It is deposited with financial institutions with the strongest credit ratings for short periods.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2012 of 3,355m 2011 2,141m was invested with 29 2011 24 financial institutions.
A credit limit is allocated to each institution taking account of its market capitalisation, credit rating and credit default swap price.
The Group has no exposure to Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese or Spanish banks.
Additionally, the Group monitors its exposure to banks which have exposure to these countries.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid, such as short-term deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has reduced its exposure to credit risk through this process.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables, no one counterparty constitutes more than 8% of the balance 2011 6%.
Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to volatility in earnings and cash flows from movements in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly the US dollar, Euro and Saudi Riyal.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of foreign currency denominated transactions.
All material firm transactional exposures are hedged, unless otherwise approved as exceptions by the Treasury Review Management Committee, and the Group aims, where possible, to apply hedge accounting to these transactions.
The Group is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of the translation of net assets and income statements of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement or balance sheet of foreign subsidiaries and equity accounted investments it regards as long-term investments.

Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The global nature of the Groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
The Group also uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
The Group aims to achieve hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
