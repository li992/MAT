Notes on the Accounts continued 27 Financial Risk Management The Company is an investment company, listed on the London Stock Exchange, and conducts its affairs so as to qualify in the United Kingdom UK as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
In so qualifying, the Company is exempted in the UK from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a policy of investing primarily in an internationally diversified portfolio of public listed equities, as well as unlisted securities and private equity, with the use of gearing.
In pursuing the objective, the Company is exposed to financial risks which could result in a reduction of either or both of the value of the net assets and the profits available for distribution by way of dividend.
These financial risks are principally related to the market currency movements, interest rate changes and security price movements, liquidity and credit.
The Board of Directors, together with the Manager, is responsible for the Companys risk management.
The Directors policies and processes for managing the financial risks are set out in a, b and c below.
The accounting policies which govern the reported Balance Sheet carrying values of the underlying financial assets and liabilities, as well as the related income and expenditure, are set out in note 2 on the accounts.
The policies are in compliance with UK Accounting Standards and best practice, and include the valuation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value except as noted in d below and in note 18 in respect of debenture stocks.
The Company does not make use of hedge accounting rules.
a Market risks The fair value of equity and other financial securities including derivatives held in the Companys portfolio fluctuates with changes in market prices.
Prices are themselves affected by movements in currencies and interest rates and by other financial issues, including the market perception of future risks.
The Boards policies for managing these risks within the Companys objective include: risk diversification no more than 5% of the portfolio may be invested in unlisted securities, excluding private equity investments, and no single investment may be made which exceeds 10% of the value of the portfolio at the time of acquisition: currency exposure borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies: and gearing-borrowings including the debentures value at market value should not normally exceed 20% of shareholders funds.
Options may only be written on quoted stocks and the total nominal exposure is limited to a maximum of 5% of the UK portfolio at the time of investment for both put and call options.
The Board meets regularly to review full, timely and relevant information on investment performance and financial results.
The Manager assesses exposure to market risks when making each investment decision and monitors ongoing market risk within the portfolio.
A description of derivative positions, which are also exposed to market price changes, together with the Managers and Boards strategies for using these positions for efficient portfolio management is contained in this note, under Other market risk exposures page 59.
The Companys other assets and liabilities may be denominated in currencies other than Sterling and may also be exposed to interest rate risks.
The Manager and the Board regularly monitor these risks.
The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Borrowings are limited to amounts and currencies commensurate with the portfolios exposure to those currencies, thereby limiting the Companys exposure to future changes in foreign exchange rates.
Debenture stocks were issued as part of the Companys planned gearing.
All contracts and compliance with them, including the Debenture trust deeds, are agreed and monitored by the Board.
Gearing may be short or long-term in Sterling and foreign currencies, and enables the Company to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
Income earned in foreign currencies is converted to Sterling on receipt.
The Board regularly monitors the effects on net revenue of interest earned on deposits and paid on gearing.
The exchange rates applying against Sterling at 31 December, and the average rates during the year, were as follows: 2012 Average 2011 US Dollar 1.6255 1.5899 1.5541 Euro 1.2329 1.2308 1.1972 Yen 140.5489 126.8746 119.5725 Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and exchange rates applying at each Balance Sheet date, a weakening or strengthening of Sterling against each of these currencies by 10% would have had the following approximate effect on annualised income after tax and on net asset value NAV per share: 2012 2011 US$ US$ Weakening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income Statement Return after tax Revenue return 676 383 109 874 502 234 Capital return 84,023 33,074 5,427 81,194 28,932 9,686 Total return 84,699 33,457 5,536 82,068 29,434 9,920 NAV per share pence 14.67 5.80 0.96 13.90 4.99 1.68 Report and Accounts 2012 57 Notes on the Accounts continued 27 Financial Risk Management continued 2012 2011 US$ US$ Strengthening of Sterling 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Income statement return after tax Revenue return 676 383 109 874 502 234 Capital return 84,023 33,074 5,427 81,194 28,932 9,686 Total return 84,699 33,457 5,536 82,068 29,434 9,920 NAV per share pence 14.67 5.80 0.96 13.90 4.99 1.68 These analyses are broadly representative of the Companys activities during the current and prior year as a whole, although the level of the Companys exposure to currencies fluctuates in accordance with the investment and risk management processes.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of the financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risks at 31 December is shown below: 2011 2012 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Exposure to floating rates Cash 9,660 9,660 Borrowings Overdrafts 17,916 17,916 Exposure to fixed rates Cash 16,339 16,339 Debentures 110,575 110,575 110,575 110,575 Other borrowings 115,000 96,175 211,175 175,501 175,501 Net exposures At year end 89,001 206,750 295,751 193,417 110,575 303,992 Maximum in year 129,784 215,607 345,391 233,966 110,575 344,541 Minimum in year 92,053 161,479 253,532 135,179 110,575 245,754 Exposures vary throughout the year as a consequence of changes in the composition of the net assets of the Company arising out of the investment and risk management processes.
Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts and borrowings, is at ruling market rates.
The interest rates applying on the debenture stocks are set out in note 18 on the accounts.
There were no material holdings in fixed interest investment securities during the year or at the year end.
The Companys total returns and net assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates on cash and borrowings, except in respect of the debentures on which the interest rate is fixed.
The debentures are valued in the accounts at par value.
Based on the financial assets and liabilities held, and the interest rates pertaining, at each Balance Sheet date, a decrease or increase in interest rates by 2% would have the following approximate effects on the Income Statement revenue and capital returns after tax and on the NAV: 2012 2011 Increase Decrease Increase Decrease in rate in rate in rate in rate 000s 000s 000s 000s Revenue return 97 97 179 179 Capital return 97 97 179 179 Total return 194 194 358 358 NAV per share pence 0.03 0.03 0.06 0.06 58 Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust PLC
