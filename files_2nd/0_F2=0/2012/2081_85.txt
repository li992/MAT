2 Major projects We approved eight major projects during FY2012 for a total investment commitment of US$7.5 billion BHP Billiton share.
Pre-commitment funding of US$2.7 billion BHP Billiton share was also approved to further progress a series of development options.
In response to the challenging external environment, the Group has chosen to delay the 2.5 mtpa 100 per cent basis expansion of Peak Downs that is associated with the Caval Ridge mine development, Australia.
The 5.5 mtpa 100 per cent basis Caval Ridge mine remains on schedule to deliver first production in CY2014.
With 20 major projects currently in execution with a combined budget of US$22.8 billion, we are largely committed for FY2013.
No major project approvals are expected over this time frame.
As our current expenditure commitments decline, we will seek to allocate future capital to those options that maximise shareholder value, while also considering the balance between shortand long-term returns.
In addition, our Onshore US business invested US$3.7 billion in exploration and development expenditure in FY2012 and expects to spend a further US$4.0 billion in FY2013.
Six major projects delivered first production in FY2012, namely: WAIO Rapid Growth Project 5, Worsley Efficiency and Growth, North West Shelf CWLH Life Extension and the New South Wales Energy Coal RX1 Project, all Australia, the Antamina Expansion, Peru, and the Escondida Ore Access project, Chile.
