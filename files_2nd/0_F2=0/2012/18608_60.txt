Awards subject to an absolute total shareholder return performance, which is a market based performance condition, have been valued at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model.
Awards subject to growth in NNNAV, which is a non-market based performance condition, have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards granted under the DBP have no specific performance conditions other than the company meeting its target for operating profit before valuation movements and non-recurring items OPBVM and continued employment by the group.
There is a three-year vesting period from the date of grant.
One-third of the awards vest at the end of each year.
Participants can choose to exercise their awards on vesting or to retain their awards within the plan until the end of the third year at which point a 50% matching element is added to their award entitlement.
There are currently three schemes in operation commencing on 3 February 2010, 6 December 2010 and 16 December 2011 respectively.
Awards under the DBP have been valued based on the share price at the date of the award less the dividend yield at the award date as there is no entitlement to dividends during the vesting period.
Awards under the SAYE scheme have been valued at fair value using a Black-Scholes valuation model.
Awards under the SIP scheme have been based on the share price at the date of the award.
