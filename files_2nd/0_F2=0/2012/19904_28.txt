Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The UNITE Group plc, the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set out in the Business Review on pages 22 to 37.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections until the end of 2014.
The Group has borrowing facilities expiring in 2013 and 2014, but has capacity in place within existing committed facilities to refinance all of the 2013 expiries.
Plans are also in place to refinance remaining debt facilities that mature in 2013 and 2014 over the course of the next 12 months.
Historically the Group has maintained positive relationships with lenders and has arranged a significant level of new debt every year to manage its debt position and remain within its borrowing covenants.
The Group is in full compliance with its borrowing covenants at 31 December 2012 as set out in note 4.5c.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, investment property under development, investments in subsidiaries, interest rate swaps and land and buildings included in property, plant and equipment all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets.
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective There are no new standards, amendments or interpretations which are effective for the first time in 2012.
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income mandatory for year commencing on or after 1 July 2012.
The amendments require an entity to present the items of other comprehensive that may be recycled to profit or loss in the future if certain conditions are met, separately from those that would never be recycled to profit or loss.
Consequently, as the Group presents items of other comprehensive income before related income tax effects the aggregated income tax amount would need to be allocated between those sections.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 2011 Separate Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and Amendments to IAS 28 2008 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities are all mandatory for years commencing on or after 1 January 2014.
These are part of a new suite of standards on consolidation and related standards, replacing the existing accounting for subsidiaries and joint ventures now joint arrangements, and making limited amendments in relation to associates.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement mandatory for year commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities mandatory for years commencing on or after 1 January 2013.

It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
Transfer of properties held as current assets In December 2012, the Board decided to transfer most of the properties held as current assets to investment property based on a change of use.
All of these properties are being leased to customers and the Board has now concluded that these assets are no longer likely to be sold in the near term but will be held for rental income and capital growth.
Since the establishment of the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF in 2006, the Group has been required to offer all newly completed properties which meet certain performance criteria for sale to USAF, and USAF may be required to purchase assets which meet certain conditions.
Hence these assets have been accounted for as current assets since that time.
More recently USAF has had limited equity available to purchase property and the Group strategy has also shifted to holding property longer term.
The Group will continue to make strategic disposals to manage the quality of the portfolio and the gearing levels in the business.
During the second half of 2012 the Group entered into a new joint venture intending to develop and hold investment property in London and designed to be its primary development vehicle.
The Group has also secured further long term funding with Legal and General and with the issue of its retail bond, this supports the Group strategy to hold property for the longer term.
It is the combination of these factors that has led the Group to conclude that transfer is now appropriate.
As shown in note 3.1, this has resulted in the recognition in the income statement of 49.7 million of revaluation gains not previously recognised in the IFRS statements.
There remain a few properties under development which have not been transferred as there is a clear current intention to sell these in the near future.
The other areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which are as follows: Classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4 The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: Valuation of investment property, investment property under development, completed property and properties under development note 3.1 Onerous contract provisions note 2.5 Taxation note 2.6 Valuation of interest rate swaps note 4.2 Impairment of trade receivables note 5.2 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 77 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and adjusted net asset value NAV per share.
Net portfolio contribution NPC and NAV movement are the Groups main key performance indicators.
This reflects the way the business is managed and how the directors assess the performance of the Group.
2.1 Segmental information The Board of Directors monitor the business along two activity lines.
The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 are Operations and Property.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Board therefore does not consider that the Group has meaningful geographical segments.
a Operations The Operations business manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
NPC is the key indicator which is used by the Board to manage the Operations business.
The segmental result is outlined below.

Operating lease rentals arise from properties which the Group has sold and is now leasing back.
As these properties contribute to the Groups rental income, the Group consider these lease costs to be a form of financing.

The UMS loss in 2012 includes trading losses of nil 2011: 5.5 million together with a provision of 1.0 million 2011: 5.6 million for completing loss making contracts: provisions for onerous leases of nil 2011: 5.4 million : and impairment of other fixed assets of nil 2011: 3.7 million and inventory of nil 2011: 0.8 million.
c Segmental contribution to NAV The Board does not use balance sheet information split out by segment to monitor and manage the Groups activities.
Instead the position of the Group is managed by reviewing the increases in Adjusted NAV contributed by each segment during the period.
Contributions to Adjusted NAV by each segment during the year is as follows: 2012 2011 Note m m Operations Net portfolio contribution 19.1 11.0 2.1a Property Rental growth 33.8 22.9 Yield movement 6.1 Disposals and acquisition costs 1.4 0.6 Capital expenditure and refurbishments 1.8 Rental property gains 28.1 23.5 Development property gains 23.7 33.3 51.8 56.8 UMS 1.0 21.0 Pre-contract and other development costs 2.7 3.4 Total property 48.1 32.4 Unallocated 15.2 3.4 Total adjusted NAV movement in the period 52.0 40.0 Total adjusted NAV brought forward 514.5 474.5 Total adjusted NAV carried forward 2.3a 566.5 514.5 The unallocated amount includes cash received from Landsbanki of 2.9 million 2011: nil, restructuring costs of nil 2011: 1.6 million, dividends of 3.6 million 2011: 0.8 million, current tax charges of 0.4 million 2011: 0.4 million, costs relating to the set-up of LSAV 1.7 million 2011: nil and swap losses, associated with the early termination of swaps relating to refinancing activity of 10.4 million 2011: 0.5 million.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 79 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.2 Adjusted profit and EPS In addition to the IFRS reporting measures, the Group reports adjusted profit on the basis recommended for real estate companies by EPRA, the European Public Real Estate Association, except for minority interests.
The calculation of adjusted profit loss and adjusted earnings per share has been changed in the period to exclude the impact of property disposals and trading in order to align adjusted profit loss with that recommended by EPRA and to remove the fluctuations these items cause to Groups underlying recurring profits.
Prior period numbers have been restated to present the results on a consistent basis.
a Adjusted profit and reconciliation to IFRS The adjusted profit loss excludes movements relating to changes in values of investment properties and interest rate swaps, which are included in the profit reported under IFRS.
The adjusted profit loss reconciles to the profit reported under IFRS as follows: 2012 2011 Note m m Operations segment result Net portfolio contribution 2.1a 19.1 11.0 Property segment result pre UMS losses 2.1b 2.7 3.3 Unallocated to segments 0.5 3.6 Adjusted profit pre UMS losses 16.9 4.1 UMS losses 1.0 21.0 2.1b Adjusted profit loss 15.9 16.9 Net valuation gains on investment property 3.1 29.8 7.7 Valuation gains realised on transfer of completed property 3.1 49.7 Property disposals and write downs 14.7 1.3 LSAV set up costs 1.3 Share of joint venture gains on investment property 3.4b 14.9 10.7 Share of joint venture property disposals and write downs 0.3 Share of joint venture LSAV set up costs 0.4 Mark to market changes in interest rate swaps 7.6 10.6 4.3 Interest rate swap payments on ineffective hedges 9.0 10.2 Share of joint venture interest rate swaps charges 0.6 0.4 3.4b Current tax included in unallocated to segments 0.4 0.4 Share of joint venture deferred tax credit charge 0.4 0.3 3.4b Minority interest share of NPC 1.0 1.2 3.4b Profit before tax 126.2 4.7 Within IFRS reported profit, there is a 7.6 million loss 2011: 10.6 million loss relating to movements in the mark to market of ineffective interest rate swaps, this full loss can be seen in note 4.3.
Part of this movement, 9.0 million 2011: 10.2 million relates to actual interest payments made on these swaps and is considered to be a true operating cost of the Operations Segment.
It is therefore already included within Net Financing Costs in NPC Operating Segment result in note 2.1a.
The minority interest share, or non-controlling interest, arises as a result of the Company not owning 100% of the share capital of one of its subsidiaries, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd. More detail is provided in note 3.4.
Unallocated to segments includes share of joint venture amounts received from Landsbanki of 2.9 million 2011: nil, restructuring costs of nil million 2011: 1.6 million, current tax charges of 0.4 million 2011: 0.4 million, contributions to the UNITE Foundation of 0.2 million 2011: nil and share option fair value charges of 1.5 million 2011: 1.2 million.
b EPS and Adjusted EPS EPS is the amount of post-tax profits attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is adjusted in order to more accurately show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
Adjusted EPS is calculated using adjusted profit loss as set out above.

Also excluded from the potential dilutive shares share options are 3,176,000 options in existence at 31 December 2012 2011: 1,460,000 which are subject to conditions that have not yet been met.
2.3 Adjusted Net Assets and NAV per share Adjusted NAV as recommended by EPRA excludes the mark to market valuation of swaps, deferred tax liabilities and recognises all properties at market value.
This is the key performance measure that the Board uses to monitor and manage the position of the segments.

Revenue has increased due to increased rental income and planned property sales to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF, the London Student Accommodation Venture LSAV note 3.4c and other third parties.
Accounting policies Revenue is recognised on the following bases: Rental income Rental income from property leased out under operating leases comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are sometimes granted on commercial units: these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Property sales Income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged.
Manufacturing revenue Revenue from the sale of modules and related services is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
For modules this is on receipt of customer acceptance following manufacture and for related services as the service is provided.
Management and promote fees Management and promote fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services are provided.
The Group can earn promote fees relative to criteria specified in the joint venture agreements.

The decision to cease trading at UMS resulted in future lease payments and associated costs becoming onerous.
Discounted future payments of 0.7 million 2011: 5.4 million relating to the lease of the factory site have been provided in respect of these leases of which 0.2 million 2011: 4.7 million is not expected to be realised until 2014 and is therefore disclosed as due after one year.
There has been a reduction of 4.7 million in the lease provision following sub-let interest in the manufacturing premises, which has been offset by further costs incurred completing the onerous contracts.
Contract losses exceeded the amount previously provided by 5.7million resulting in a net UMS related loss of 1.0 million as shown in note 2.1b.
Future payments have been discounted using a market rate of 5%.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.6 Tax The Group has not paid any corporation tax in the recent past due to the availability of capital allowances, indexation and brought forward losses.
However it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries predominantly the investments in USAF.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
a Tax income statement The total taxation credit charge in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Corporation tax in respect of income Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 0.6 0.5 Adjustments for prior years Current tax charge 0.6 0.5 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 1.3 0.9 Effect of change in tax rate 0.3 0.3 Adjustments for prior years 0.3 Deferred tax credit charge 1.6 0.3 Total tax credit charge in income statement 1.0 0.8 In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax credit of 1.0 million arises on a profit before tax of 126.2 million, the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2012 2011 m m Profit before tax 126.2 4.7 Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% 30.9 1.2 Effect of indexation on investment and development property 3.3 2.4 Non-deductible expenses 0.8 0.9 Effect of transferring property from current to non-current assets 10.8 Share of joint venture profit 0.1 0.4 Movement on unprovided deferred tax asset 13.1 1.6 Profit on disposal of assets not chargeable to tax 0.1 Effect of property disposals 4.3 0.4 Adjustments for prior years deferred tax 0.3 Rate difference on deferred tax 1.1 0.3 Total tax credit charge in the income statement 1.0 0.8 b Tax other comprehensive income Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling 0.8 million 2011: 0.4 million has been recognised representing deferred tax.
An analysis of this is included below in the deferred tax movement table.

Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary timing differences of 44.1 million 2011: 12.2 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 85 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 3: Asset management The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures.
The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives adjusted net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in four groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups adjusted NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that the Group intends to hold for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Investment property under development fixed assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Investment property on completion.
iii Completed properties current assets These are assets acquired by the Group with the intention to hold the assets for a short period prior to disposal to a joint venture or third parties.
The Group continues to earn rental income and capital appreciation on these assets which are held at cost in the balance sheet.
iv Properties under development current assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Completed properties on completion.
The Group also acquires land which it intends to develop.
Land is held within inventories until planning permission is obtained, at which point it is transferred to investment property under development or properties under development.
As disclosed in note 1 in greater detail, in 2012 the Group has transferred all of its completed property to investment property, based on a change of use and an intention to hold for the longer term.
The effects of this change are shown in the following tables.
As at 31 December 2012 three properties remain classified as property under development as there is a clear intention to sell in the near term.
These include one property with a carrying value of 19.2 million and a fair value of 38.2 million which is subject to a conditional contract to sell to LSAV after completion of construction.
The property portfolio is valued every six months by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the external valuers in the years ending 31 December 2012 and 2011.
Accounting policies Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are disclosed in note 4.6a.
Investment property and investment property under development are held at fair value.
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 5.9% 2011: 6.7%.
The valuations are based on assumptions made by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable and associated costs.
Valuations reflect, where appropriate, the type of tenants actually in occupation or responsible for meeting lease commitments or likely to be in occupation after letting of vacant accommodation and the markets general perception of their credit worthiness: the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between lessor and lessee: and the remaining economic life of the property.

These properties are included in adjusted NAV at their fair value, valued on the same basis as for investment property and investment property under development, by external valuers.
The fair value of the Groups wholly owned properties at the year ended 31 December 2012 is as follows: Investment Investment property under Completed Property under property development property development Total m m m m m Carrying value at 31 December 2012 above 762.8 37.6 26.5 826.9 Valuation gains not recognised under IFRS but included in Adjusted NAV Brought forward 22.2 53.9 76.1 Transfer from property under development 49.4 49.4 Transfer of completed property 49.7 49.7 Disposals 26.0 26.0 Valuation gain in year 4.1 14.5 18.6 19.0 19.0 Market value at 31 December 2012 762.8 37.6 45.5 845.9 During the year properties with a carrying value of 263.6 million and a fair value of 313.3 million were transferred from completed property to investment property.

Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties.
Property, plant and equipment mainly comprise leasehold improvements at the Groups head office and London office as well as computer hardware and software at these sites.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter life of lease and economic life Other assets 4-20 years Intangible assets Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and processes transactions within the sales cycle.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred.

The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.

The two properties were held on the balance sheet as completed property within current assets, the proceeds and carrying value of the properties is therefore recognised in revenue and cost of sales in the income statement and the cash flows in operating activities.
No properties were sold to joint ventures in 2011.

UCC properties are partly funded by debt totalling 226.7 million 2011: 248.4 million which equates to 59.5% 2011: 64.2% of the market value of these properties.
The Group has guaranteed its share, 30%, of this debt amounting to 68.0 million 2011: 74.5 million.
This guarantee only takes effect in the event that the joint venture is unable to repay the debt within nine months of it becoming due.
The Group considers the likelihood of the guarantee being invoked to be remote based on the level of debt and the time frames allowed under the arrangements.
These guarantees are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 4.
OCB properties are partly funded by debt totalling 113.0 million 2011: 113.5 million which equates to 64.7% 2011: 60.1% of the market value of these properties.

In addition a market value adjustment is applied based on the profitability of the main development company.
This represents Level 2 in the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
In addition to the equity investment in subsidiaries and joint ventures, the Company has provided a loan with interest chargeable at 6.125% to LDC Holdings plc.
The carrying value of the loan to LDC Holdings plc was 90.0 million 2011: nil.

The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 100.2 29.2 1.2 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 65.1 251.9 In more than two years but not more than five years 131.8 140.4 In more than five years 230.8 29.2 90.0 427.7 421.5 90.0 Total borrowings 527.9 450.7 91.2 In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 34.9 million 2011: 14.3 million.
A further working capital facility of 20.0 million 2011: 20.0 million is also available.
A further 146 million 2011: 132 million of facilities are available if certain conditions are met.
Of this amount 75 million 2011: 30 million is only available for rental properties and 41 million 2011: 99 million for development properties.
The remaining amount is available for investment or development.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans carried at 227.8 million 2011: 17.4 million.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of these loans is 237.2 million 2011: 18.4 million.
Properties with a carrying value of 728.1 million 2011: 696.8 million have been pledged as security against the Groups borrowings.
4.2 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 4: Funding continued 4.2 Interest rate swaps continued The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2012 2011 m m Current 0.7 Non-current 23.0 39.0 Fair value of interest rate swaps 23.7 39.0 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
The IFRS 7 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
4.3 Net financing costs Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.

Adjusted net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.
The Groups gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 2012 2011 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 5.1 75.4 16.8 Current borrowings 4.1 100.2 29.2 Non-current borrowings 4.1 427.7 421.5 Interest rate swaps liabilities 4.2 23.7 39.0 Net debt per balance sheet 476.2 472.9 Mark to market of interest rate swaps 23.6 38.9 Adjusted net debt 452.6 434.0 Reported net asset value attributable to owners of the parent company 2.3c 515.8 387.6 Adjusted net asset value 2.3c 566.5 514.5 Gearing Basic Net debt Reported net asset value 92% 122% Adjusted gearing Adjusted net debt Adjusted net asset value 80% 84% See-through adjusted gearing including share of JV properties and net debt 114% 126% Seethrough adjusted LTV 52% 54% 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing The Group had no specific development borrowings at 31 December 2012 and is currently funding its developments from general borrowings.
The Group has development debt facilities in place to finance those going forward.
After taking account of interest rate swaps, 36 million 89% of the Groups development borrowings at 31 December 2011 was fixed.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Groups policy also allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 97 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 4: Funding continued 4.5 Financial risk factors continued a Interest rate risk continued ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under both floating and fixed rate arrangements.
The majority of this floating debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2012, the Groups policy guideline has been to hedge in excess of 75% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2-10 years.
At 31 December 2012, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 88% 2011: 69% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
Excluding the 241 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 5.5% 2011: 5.7% for an average period of 9 years 2011: 2 years, including these swaps the average rate is 5.5%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2012 against 258 million 2011: 302.9 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2012 2011 Nominal Applicable Nominal Applicable amount hedged interest rates amount hedged interest rates m % m % Within one year Between one and two years 116.2 2.3-5.8 27.6 5.2-5.3 Between two and five years 122.8 1.7-5.3 242.5 2.8-5.8 More than five years 1.8 5.6 32.8 5.3-5.6 During the year, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 1.2 million 2011: 0.8 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
