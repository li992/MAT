In addition to the ordinary business, five resolutions are proposed as special business, one as an ordinary resolution and four as special resolutions.
Ordinary Resolution 12 and Special Resolution 13: Authority to Allot Shares Resolution 12 is an Ordinary Resolution seeking renewal of the current authority for the Directors to allot up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital, this being an aggregate nominal amount of 4,877,918 as at 31 May 2012.
Resolution 13 is a Special Resolution which seeks renewal of the current authority to issue up to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital pursuant to a rights issue or otherwise than in connection with a rights issue, dis-applying preemption rights.
This will allow shares to be issued to new shareholders, within the prescribed limits, without having to be offered to existing shareholders first, thus broadening the shareholder base of the Company.
The Directors will not dilute the interests of existing shareholders by using the authority to issue shares at a price which is less than the Net Asset Value of the existing shares in issue at that time.
These authorities will expire at the next AGM of the Company or fifteen months after the passing of the resolutions, whichever is the earlier.
Special Resolution 14: Authority to Buy Back Shares Resolution 14 seeks to renew the Directors authority to purchase up to 14.99% of the Companys issued share capital, this being 29,247,998 ordinary shares as at 31 May 2012.
The authority will expire at the Companys next AGM or fifteen months following the passing of this resolution, if earlier.
The principal purpose of share buy backs is to enhance the net asset value for remaining shareholders and purchases will only be made if they enhance the net asset value for the remaining shareholders.
