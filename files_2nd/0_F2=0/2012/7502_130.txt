Overview Business review Corporate responsibility Governance Financial statements CONTINGENT LIABILITIES As set out in the Chairmans statement, Chief Executives review and Financial review, we continue to develop our responses to the issues identified in our UK business, including being in regular dialogue with the FSA.
There is currently no certainty as to the nature or extent of the action, if any, that the FSA may seek to take following the conclusion of its investigation and accordingly any related financial effect, which could include a fine, cannot be estimated reliably.
As a result, no provisions have been made in this regard in the current year.
