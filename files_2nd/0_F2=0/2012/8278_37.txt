The Audit Committee has a process to ensure that any non-audit services do not compromise the independence and objectivity of the external auditor and that relevant UK and US professional and regulatory requirements are met.
A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.

Corporation tax liabilities are not expected to arise in respect of 2012 or for a number of years thereafter due to expenses and associated tax losses attributable principally to employment matters, in particular additional shortfall contributions to the UK pension plan see note 25.

In 2012, a previously recorded impairment charge relating to a North American hotel was reversed in full following a re-assessment of its recoverable amount, based on the market value of the hotel as determined by an independent professional property valuer.
Of the impairment reversal in 2011, $11m arose in March 2011 on the classification of a North American hotel as held for sale.
The amount of the reversal was based on the expected net sales proceeds which were subsequently realised on the disposal of the hotel see note 11.
A further $12m arose in respect of another North American hotel following a re-assessment of its recoverable amount, based on value in use.
Estimated future cash flows were discounted at a pre-tax rate of 12.6%.
All impairment charges and reversals are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement.
The carrying value of property, plant and equipment held under finance leases at 31 December 2012 was $187m 2011 $190m.

Impairment charges are included within impairment on the face of the Group income statement and all cumulative impairment losses relate to the Americas managed cash-generating unit CGU see below.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs for impairment testing as follows: Cost Net book value 2012 2011 2012 2011 $m $m $m $m Asia Australasia franchised and managed operations 93 92 93 92 Americas managed operations 141 141 234 233 93 92 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that an impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans approved by management covering a five-year period or, in the absence of up-to-date strategic plans, the financial budget for the next year with an extrapolation of the cash flows for the following four years, using growth rates based on managements past experience and industry growth forecasts.
After the five-year planning period, the terminal value of future cash flows is calculated based on perpetual growth rates that do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Pre-tax discount rates are used to discount the cash flows based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks specific to the business model and territory of the CGU being tested.
Asia Australasia goodwill At 31 December 2012, the recoverable amount of the CGU has been assessed based on the approved budget for 2013 and strategic plans covering a five-year period, a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% 2011 3.5% and a discount rate of 14.3% 2011 13.9%.
Impairment was not required at either 31 December 2012 or 31 December 2011 and management believe that the carrying value of the CGU would only exceed its recoverable amount in the event of highly unlikely changes in the key assumptions.
Americas goodwill Goodwill relating to the Americas managed operations was impaired in full in 2009.
As goodwill impairment cannot be reversed, there is no sensitivity around any assumptions that could lead to further impairment adjustments.

Of the total amount of equity investments at 31 December 2012, $18m 2011 $15m were listed securities and $94m 2011 $97m unlisted: $59m 2011 $61m were denominated in US dollars, $24m 2011 $23m in Hong Kong dollars and $29m 2011 $28m in other currencies.
Unlisted equity shares are mainly investments in entities that own hotels which the Group manages.
The fair value of unlisted equity shares has been estimated using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines, using either the earnings multiple or net assets methodology as appropriate.
Listed equity share valuations are based on observable market prices.
Dividend income from available-for-sale equity securities of $5m 2011 $11m is reported as other operating income and expenses in the Group income statement.
Loans and receivables consist of trade deposits and restricted cash which are held at amortised cost.
A deposit of $37m was made in 2011 to a hotel owner in connection with the renegotiation of a management contract.
The deposit is non-interest-bearing and repayable at the end of the management contract, and is therefore held at its discounted value of $11m 2011 $10m : the discount will unwind to the income statement within financial income over the period to repayment.
Restricted cash of $29m 2011 $27m relates to cash held in bank accounts which is pledged as collateral to insurance companies for risks retained by the Group.

Retirement benefits Retirement and death in service benefits are provided for eligible Group employees in the UK principally by the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan.
The plan, which is funded and HM Revenue & Customs registered, covers approximately 598 2011 545 employees, of which 119 2011 125 are in the defined benefit section and 479 2011 420 are in the defined contribution section.
The defined benefit section of the plan closed to new entrants in 2002 and will close to future accrual for current members with effect from 1 July 2013.
New members are provided with defined contribution arrangements as will be members of the defined benefit section in July 2013.
The assets of the plan are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
In addition, there are unfunded UK pension arrangements for certain members affected by the lifetime or annual allowances which will also close to future accrual from 1 July 2013.
The Group also maintains the following US-based defined benefit plans: the funded InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan, unfunded InterContinental Hotels non-qualified pension plans and post-employment benefits schemes.
These plans are closed to new members.
The Group also operates a number of smaller pension schemes outside the UK, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the US: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
In respect of the defined benefit plans, the amounts recognised in the Group income statement, in administrative expenses, are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US and other benefits Total 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Current service cost 5 6 1 1 6 7 Interest cost on benefit obligation 25 28 9 10 1 1 35 39 Expected return on plan assets 28 29 9 9 37 38 Operating profit before exceptional items 2 5 1 2 1 1 4 8 Exceptional items curtailment gain 28 28 2 23 1 2 1 1 4 20 The curtailment gain in 2011 arose in respect of the UK pension plan and from the decision to close the defined benefit section to future accrual with effect from 1 July 2013.

Assumptions The principal financial assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the benefit obligation are: Pension plans Post-employment UK US benefits 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 % % % % % % Wages and salaries increases 4.5 4.6 4.0 4.0 Pensions increases 3.0 3.1 Discount rate 4.5 4.7 3.5 4.1 3.5 4.1 Inflation rate 3.0 3.1 Healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year: Pre 65 ultimate rate reached in 2021 9.0 9.5 Post 65 ultimate rate reached in 2024 11.8 12.8 Ultimate rate that the cost trend rate trends to 5.0 5.0 Mortality is the most significant demographic assumption.
The current assumptions for the UK plan are based on the S1NA tables with long cohort projections and a 1.25% per annum underpin to future mortality improvements with age rated down by 1.75 years for pensioners and 1.5 years for non-pensioners.
In the US, the current assumptions are based on the RP-2000 IRS PPA @ 2013 Non-Annuitant Annuitant healthy tables for males and females.
Accordingly, assumed life expectancy at retirement age is as follows: Pension plans UK US 2012 2011 2012 2011 Years Years Years Years a Current pensioners at 65 male 24 24 19 19 female 27 27 21 21 b Future pensioners at 65 male 27 26 21 21 female 30 29 22 22 a Relates to assumptions based on longevity in years following retirement at the end of the reporting period.

In respect of the UK plan, the long-term rate of return assumptions are 3.5% 2011 3.3% for liability matching funds and bonds and 6.4% 2011 7.4% for equities and other return seeking assets.
The UK plan is currently implementing a fide-risking strategy which is resulting in a move out of return seeking assets into liability matching funds and bonds.
Funding commitments The most recent actuarial valuation of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 31 March 2012 and showed a deficit of 132m on a funding basis.
Under the recovery plan agreed with the trustees, the Group aims to eliminate this deficit by 31 July 2014 principally through additional Company contributions of 130m.
In respect of these additional Company contributions, 10m was paid in July 2012, 45m was paid in October 2012, 30m is due for payment in July 2013, 15m is due for payment in July 2014 and 30m will be paid into a funding trust on release of a trustee charge over a hotel asset.
The amount in the funding trust may be available for release to the plan on 31 July 2014 to the extent that a funding deficit remains at that time.
The plan is formally valued every three years, or earlier with the agreement of the Company and trustees, and future valuations could lead to changes in the amounts payable by the Company.
Company contributions are expected to be $62m in 2013, including known UK additional contributions of 30m.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of $298m and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.

The deferred tax asset recognised in respect of losses of $215m 2011 $133m includes $78m 2011 $104m in respect of capital losses available to be utilised against the realisation of capital gains which are recognised as a deferred tax liability and $137m 2011 $29m in respect of revenue tax losses.
Deferred tax assets of $22m 2011 $44m are recognised in relation to legal entities which suffered a tax loss in the current or preceding period.
These assets are recognised based upon future taxable profit forecasts for the entities concerned.
Tax losses with a net tax value of $272m 2011 $358m, including capital losses with a value of $140m 2011 $134m, have not been recognised.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely with the exception of $11m which expires after four years and $1m which expires after eight years 2011 $11m which expires after five years and $1m which expires after six years.
Deferred tax assets with a net tax value of $32m 2011 $29m in respect of employee benefits, up to $34m 2011 $34m in respect of foreign tax credits and $53m 2011 $52m in respect of other items have not been recognised.
These losses and other deferred tax assets have not been recognised as the Group does not currently anticipate being able to offset these against future profits or gains in order to realise any economic benefit in the foreseeable future.
However, future benefits may arise as a result of resolving tax uncertainties, or as a consequence of case law and legislative developments which make the value of assets more certain.
At 31 December 2012, the Group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences associated with post-acquisition undistributed earnings of subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The tax which would arise upon reversal of the temporary differences is not expected to exceed $20m 2011 $20m.
Other short-term temporary differences relate primarily to provisions, accruals, amortisation and share-based payments.
