During FY2012, total costs excluding exceptional items, the impacts of inflation, exchange rate volatility and non-cash items, have increased by US$2.7 billion due to industry-wide cost pressure.
Labour and contractor cost increases accounted for over one-third of this increase in FY2012, while industrial action at Queensland Coal, Australia, created additional pressure.
The increase in costs in FY2012 was affected by major outages and disruptions.
The highest rate of cost escalation was in those businesses with a lower rate of capacity utilisation.
We are implementing broad measures across the Group that seek to substantially reduce operating costs and non-essential expenditure in FY2013.
We have been quick to respond to the change in the operating environment during FY2012 and acted decisively by closing energy intensive silicomanganese alloy production capacity in South Africa and by temporarily closing capacity at TEMCO, Australia.
In addition, metallurgical coal production at Norwich Park, Australia, was suspended following a review of the mines profitability and, since 30 June 2012, we have also announced that mining at BMAs Gregory open-cut mine will cease production from 10 October 2012.
The viability of other high-cost operations is being assessed and additional measures are being implemented that are expected to substantially reduce operating costs and non-essential expenditure across the business.
In conjunction with safety and volumes, cost control continues to be a key area of focus for each area of operation.
