Principal actuarial assumptions under IAS 19 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.20% p. a.
Retail Price Index RPI inflation 2.80% p. a.
Consumer Price Index CPI inflation 1.80% p. a.
Rate of increase of pensions in payment 5.00% p. a.

The overall expected return on assets assumption of 4.4% p. a. as at 30 September 2012 has been derived by calculating the weighted average of the expected rate of return for each asset class.
The following approach has been used to determine the expected rate of return for each asset class: fixed interest securities, current market yields equities and property, net dividend yield plus RPI inflation plus an allowance for future real dividend growth cash, current Bank of England base rate insured pensioner policies, in line with the discount rate a deduction of 0.5% to allow for investment expenses Demographic assumptions 2012 2011 100% of S1PAlc year of birth 100% of S1PAIc year of birth tables allowing for a minimum tables allowing for a minimum improvement factor of 1.25% improvement factor of 1.25% for males and 0.75% for females for males and 0.75% for females Mortality tables for pensioners each year each year Mortality tables for non-pensioners As for pensioners As for pensioners Life expectancies 30 September 2012 30 September 2011 Males Females Males Females Life expectancy for a current 65 year old 87.9 years 90.1 years 87.7 years 90.1 years Life expectancy at age 65 for a current 55 year old 90.3 years 91.7 years 89.0 years 90.9 years 137 Market value of scheme assets and expected rates of return The assets of the scheme are invested in a diversified portfolio as follows: 30 September 2012 30 September 2011 Long-term Long-term Market % of total expected rate Market % of total expected rate value scheme assets of return value Scheme assets of return m % m % Equities 6.8 31% 7.9% 5.9 32% 5.5% Bonds 9.1 42% 4.0% 7.9 42% 5.1% Properties 0.4 2% 7.9% 0.4 2% 5.5% Other 1.0 5% 0.5% 0.5 3% 0.5% Insurance policies 4.4 20% 4.2% 3.9 21% 5.3% Total value of assets 21.7 100% 18.6 100% The actual return on assets over the period was 2.9 0.4 The assets of the scheme are held with Friends Life in a managed fund.
