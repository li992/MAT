Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Significant accounting policies This section describes Barclays significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specific note, the applicable accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained within the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays PLC Group or the Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied.
There were no changes in accounting policy in the year.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include the fair valuation of investment property and particular financial instruments to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
Accounting policies Barclays prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Groups significant accounting policies relating to specific financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays applies IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities SPEs.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which it has control of the financial and operating policies through its holdings of voting shares and special purpose entities, which are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity indicates control.
The control assessment for special purpose entities includes an assessment of the Groups exposure to the risks and benefits of the entity.
The consolidation of SPEs is considered at inception, based on the arrangements in place and the assessed risk exposures at that time.
The initial consolidation analysis is revisited at a later date if: The Group acquires additional interests in the entity: The contractual arrangements of the entity are amended such that the relative exposures to risks and rewards change: and The Group acquires control over the main operating and financial decisions of the entity.
There are a number of subsidiaries in which the Group has less than half of the voting rights which are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity indicates that the entity is controlled by the Group.
Such entities are deemed to be controlled by the Group when relationships with such entities give rise to benefits that are in substance no different from those that would arise were the entity a subsidiary.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 38.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 1 Significant accounting policies continued ii Foreign currency translation The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions and balances in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances are translated into Sterling at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
The Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have different functional currencies.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the closing rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation or on partial disposal of the operation.
iii Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for the recognition, classification and measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, for the impairment of financial assets and for hedge accounting.
Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract, which is the trade date or the settlement date.
Classification and measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and may be held at fair value or amortised cost depending on the Groups intention toward the assets and the nature of the assets and liabilities, mainly determined by their contractual terms.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 18.
Derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash flows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash flows is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Groups exposure to variability in asset cash flows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash flow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash flows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash flows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity or prepayment rates.
iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Group applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument, if this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the annual general meeting and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.

Future accounting developments As at 31 December 2012 the IASB had issued the following accounting standards.
These are effective on 1 January 2013, unless otherwise indicated: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which replaces requirements in IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
This introduces new criteria to determine whether entities in which the Group has interests should be consolidated.
The implementation of IFRS 10 will result in the Group consolidating some entities that were previously not consolidated and deconsolidating some entities that were previously consolidated.
The financial impact on the Group as at 31 December 2012 if IFRS 10 had been adopted at that date would have been to decrease assets by 144m, increase liabilities by 333m and decrease total shareholders equity by 477m.
Consolidated profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 would have increased by 439m calculated by applying the transition relief guidance set out in the June 2012 Amendment to IFRS 10 for interests in entities disposed of prior to 1 January 2013.
The impact on the Core Tier 1 ratio would have been a 12bps decrease.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, which replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
This specifies the accounting for joint arrangements whether these are joint operations or joint ventures.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group: IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities.
This specifies the required disclosures in respect of interests in, and risks arising from, subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and structured entities whether consolidated or not.
As a disclosure only standard it will have no financial impact: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
This provides comprehensive guidance on how to calculate the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements: IAS 19 Employee Benefits Revised 2011.
This requires that actuarial gains and losses arising from defined benefit pension schemes are recognised in full.
Previously the Group deferred these over the remaining average service lives of the employees the corridor approach.
See Note 37 for more information and an estimate of the financial effects of adoption: and IAS 32 and IFRS 7 Amendments: Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
The circumstances in which netting is permitted have been clarified and disclosures on offsetting have been considerably expanded.
The amendments on offsetting are effective from 1 January 2014 and those on disclosures from 1 January 2013.
In 2009 and 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which contains new requirements for accounting for financial assets and liabilities and will contain new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting, replacing the corresponding requirements in IAS 39.
It will lead to significant changes in the way that the Group accounts for financial instruments.
The key changes issued and proposed relate to: Financial assets.
Financial assets will be held at either fair value or amortised cost, except for equity investments not held for trading and certain eligible debt instruments, which may be held at fair value through other comprehensive income: Financial liabilities.
Gains and losses on fair value changes in own credit arising on non-derivative financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss will be excluded from the Income Statement and instead taken to other comprehensive income: Impairment.
Credit losses expected rather than only losses incurred in the year on loans, debt securities and loan commitments not held at fair value through profit or loss will be reflected in impairment allowances: and Hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting will be more closely aligned with financial risk management.
Adoption is not mandatory until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to EU endorsement.
Earlier adoption is possible, subject to endorsement.
At this stage, it is not possible to determine the potential financial impacts of adoption on the Group.
In addition, the IASB has indicated that it will issue a new standard on accounting for leases.
Under the proposals, lessees would be required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet.
The IASB also plans to issue new standards on insurance contracts and revenue recognition.
The Group will consider the financial impacts of these new standards as they are finalised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements, are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Page Page Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale investments 245 Goodwill and intangible assets 275 Tax 247 Provisions 279 Available for sale investments 257 Pensions and post-retirement benefits 296 Fair value of financial instruments 258 240 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.

Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference by concentrating related information in one place, and to reduce duplication, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk and Financial review sections as follows: credit risk, on pages 116-154, including exposures to Eurozone countries: market risk, on pages 155-161: funding risk capital, on pages 162-171: funding risk liquidity, on pages 172-186: and segmental reporting on pages 207-208.
These are covered by the Audit opinion included on page 229. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 241 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued Performance The notes included in this section focus on the results and performance of the Group.
Information on the segmental performance, income generated, expenditure incurred, tax, earnings per share and dividends are included here.
2 Segmental reporting Presentation of segmental reporting The Groups segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and has been identified as the chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Office.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
An analysis of the Groups performance by business segment and income by geographic segment is included on pages 207 and 208.
3 Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expense The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, available for sale debt investments, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Due to the large number of products and types both assets and liabilities, there are no individual estimates that are material to the results or financial position.
See also Note 14 Financial assets designated at fair value and Note 17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value for relevant accounting policies.
Other interest income principally includes interest income relating to reverse repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Similarly, other interest expense principally includes interest expense relating to repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Included in net interest income is hedge ineffectiveness as detailed on page 256.
242 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 3 Net interest income continued 2012 Net interest income declined by 5% to 11,639m.
Interest income decreased by 7% to 19,199m, driven by a reduction in income from loans and advances to customers, which fell 810m to 16,461m, and interest income derived from available for sale investments, which fell 417m to 1,720m.
The decrease in interest income from loans and advances to customers is attributable primarily to the Investment Bank and Africa RBB reflecting lower average loan balances.
These movements were partly offset by a 291m increase in Barclaycard reflecting increased average loan balances primarily due to the Egg acquisition.
The fall in interest from available for sale investments primarily reflects lower average balances and yield in the Investment Bank and lower yields on government bonds held in the Liquidity Risk Appetite portfolio.
Interest expense reduced by 10% to 7,560m, driven by a reduction in interest on debt securities in issue of 595m to 2,929m due to lower average balances and lower yields, and a reduction in interest on subordinated liabilities of 181m to 1,632m due to lower average balances.
The net interest margin for Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management decreased to 1.85% 2011: 2.03%, primarily reflecting the reduction in contribution from Group hedging activities.
2011 Group net interest income decreased 322m to 12,201m.
Interest income rose 3% to 20,589m reflecting an increase in interest income derived from available for sale investments of 654m, predominantly as a result of the expansion of the Liquidity Risk Appetite portfolio during the year.
This was largely offset by a decrease in interest income from loans and advances to customers primarily as a result of lower average balances in the Investment Bank excluding settlement balances and cash collateral, offset partially by increased lending across the majority of other businesses.
The increase in interest expense was driven primarily by a reduction in benefits from Group hedging activities.
The net interest margin for Retail and Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth and Investment Management remained stable at 2.03% 2010: 2.03%.
Further information on business margins is presented on pages 157-159.
4 Net fee and commission income Accounting for net fee and commission income The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
2012 2011 2010 m m m Banking, investment management and credit related fees and commissions 9,948 9,958 10,142 Brokerage fees 92 87 77 Foreign exchange commission 176 163 149 Fee and commission income 10,216 10,208 10,368 Fee and commission expense 1,634 1,586 1,497 Net fee and commission income 8,582 8,622 8,871 2012 Net fee and commission income remained stable with a 40m decline to 8,582m.
Higher fees as a result of increased volumes within the Barclaycard Business Payment and US portfolios and growth in debt and equity underwriting activity were offset by lower commissions mainly from Italy mortgage sales and the impact of adverse currency movements in Africa RBB.
2011 Net fee and commission income declined 249m to 8,622m, primarily due to financial advisory and debt underwriting income within the Investment Bank being impacted by lower deal activity.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 243 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 5 Net trading income Accounting for net trading income In accordance with IAS 39, trading positions are held at fair value and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.
Income arises from both the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer business and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Own credit gains losses arise from the fair valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
See Note 17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2012 2011 2010 m m m Trading income 7,604 4,952 7,687 Own credit losses gains 4,579 2,708 391 Net trading income 3,025 7,660 8,078 Included within net trading income were gains of 656m 2011: 16m loss, 2010: 32m gain on financial assets designated at fair value and losses of 3,980m 2011: 3,850m gain, 2010: 903m loss on financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2012 Net trading income decreased 61% to 3,025m, primarily reflecting a 7,287m variance in own credit 2012: 4,579m charge: 2011: 2,708m gain as a result of improved credit spreads on Barclays issued debt.
This was offset partially by a 2,652m increase in underlying trading income, reflecting increased liquidity and higher client volumes across a number of product areas in FICC and an improved performance in cash equities and equity derivatives in Equities and Prime Services.
2011 Net trading income decreased 418m to 7,660m.
Trading income, which primarily arises in the Investment Bank, decreased 36% to 4,952m reflecting lower contributions from Commodities and Fixed Income Rates and Credit, partially offset by an increase in Currency that benefitted from market volatility and strong client volumes.
The impact from difficult trading conditions was partially offset by a gain on own credit of 2,708m 2010: 391m.
6 Net investment income Accounting for net investment income Dividends are recognised when the right to receive the dividend has been established.
Other accounting policies relating to net investment income are set out in Note 16, Available for sale investments, and Note 14, Financial assets designated at fair value.
2012 2011 2010 m m m Net gain from disposal of available for sale investments 452 1,645 1,027 Dividend income 42 129 116 Net gain from financial instruments designated at fair value 206 287 274 Other investment income 117 244 60 Net investment income 817 2,305 1,477 2012 Net investment income decreased by 1,488m to 817m largely driven by the non-recurrence of gains on disposal of the economic structural hedge portfolio during 2011 and a reduction in dividends following the disposal of the Groups stake in BlackRock, Inc. during the first half of 2012.
2011 Net investment income increased by 828m to 2,305m due to the gains on the sale of hedging instruments held as part of the economic structural hedge portfolio and increases in income from investment properties.
244 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 7 Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale investments Accounting for the impairment of financial assets Loans and other assets held at amortised cost In accordance with IAS 39, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets or available for sale investments debt or equity will not be recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash flows from the assets.
These events include: becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider: it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: and observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans, and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together, generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash flows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash flows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount, representing the unwind of the discount of the expected cash flows, including the principal due on non-accrual loans.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Groups internal processes and all recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Available for sale investments Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have occurred, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 245 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 7 Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale assets continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The calculation of the impairment allowance involves the use of judgement, based on the Groups experience of managing credit risk.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
These statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears and historical information on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reflected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reflected in the income statement for these retail portfolios is 2,075m 2011: 2,477m: 2010: 3,379m and amounts to 58% 2011: 65%: 2010: 60% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
For individually significant assets, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account for example, the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculation of future cash flows.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reflected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is 1,484m 2011: 1,313m: 2010: 2,246m and amounts to 42% 2011: 35%: 2010: 40% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
Further information on impairment allowances and related credit information is set out within the Risk review.

The movements on the impairment allowance and the charge for the year is shown on page 127.
2012 Loan impairment fell 6% to 3,559m reflecting lower impairment in UKRBB, Barclaycard and Corporate Banking, partially offset by higher charges in Europe and South Africa and a higher charge in the Investment Bank.
The increase in the Investment Bank was primarily related to ABS CDO Super Senior positions and losses on a small number of single name exposures.
The prior year included a non-recurring release of 223m.
2011 Loan impairment fell 33% to 3,790m reflecting generally improving underlying trends across the majority of retail and wholesale businesses.
Retail impairment charges reduced 27%, principally relating to Barclaycard, UKRBB and Africa RBB.
Wholesale impairment charges reduced 41%, principally reflecting lower charges in Spain and in the Investment Bank, including a non-recurring release of 223m relating to the loan to Protium which has now been repaid.
As at 30 September 2011, an impairment charge of 1,800m was recognised resulting from an assessment that there was objective evidence that the Groups investment in BlackRock, Inc. was impaired.
The impairment reflects the recycling through the income statement of the cumulative reduction in market value previously recognised in the available for sale reserve, since the Groups acquisition of its holding in BlackRock, Inc. as part of the sale of Barclays Global Investors on 1 December 2009.
Further analysis of the Groups impairment charges is presented on pages 124-128.

An increase in expenses relating to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme were offset by a reduction in the underlying cost base reflecting the impact of the Group-wide cost reduction initiative.
2011 Administration and general expenses decreased 229m to 6,356m, principally reflecting the benefits of restructuring and the non-recurrence of the one-off provision in respect of the resolution of a review of Barclays compliance with US economic sanctions that occurred in 2010.
These reductions have been offset by an increase in outsourcing and professional services as a result of Barclaycard acquisitions and restructuring charges.
9 Profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures During the year, the profit on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was 28m 2011: loss of 94m, principally relating to the disposal of the Groups 51% stake in Iveco Finance in May 2012.
The Iveco gain on disposal of 21m relates to accumulated foreign exchange gains that were previously recognised directly in equity and were recycled through the income statement within Head Office and Other Operations.
10 Tax Accounting for income taxes Barclays applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits Current Tax is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

The high effective tax rate in 2012 is a result of the combination of losses in the UK, primarily relating to the own credit charge of 4,579m 2011: gain of 2,708m with tax relief at 24.5% 2011: 26.5% and profits outside the UK taxed at higher rates represented by 402m 2011: 190m in the tax rate reconciliation above.

In accordance with US tax rules tax losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years and therefore any unused tax losses may begin to expire in 2028.
The remaining balance primarily relates to temporary differences which are not time limited.
The deferred tax asset for the US Branch has been measured using a marginal tax rate being the excess of the US tax rate a combination of Federal, City and State taxes over the UK statutory rate.
BGUS returned to profitability in 2012, primarily driven by Barclays Capital Inc. its US Broker Dealer, with tax losses expected to be fully utilised in 2013.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would not extend the recovery period.
The assumptions used in the profit forecasts do not include any incremental tax planning strategies.
The tax losses in the US Branch are projected to be fully utilised by 2018, based on profit forecasts covering the period from 2013 to 2015, with no profit growth assumed after 2015.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would extend the recovery period by 2 years to 2020.
Spain deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in Spain includes 322m 2011: 417m relating to tax losses incurred from 2010 to 2012.
In accordance with Spanish tax rules tax losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 18 years.
The asset has reduced to 602m 2011: 696m reflecting a lower anticipated tax recovery rate.
The 2010 to 2012 tax losses are expected to be fully utilised by 2023.
Additional losses are anticipated to arise in 2013, partly relating to restructuring costs.
The recoverability of the deferred tax asset has been determined using business profit forecasts covering the period from 2013 to 2016, with a subsequent annual growth rate of 2% p. a.
A 20% reduction in forecast profits for 2016 and each subsequent year would extend the recovery period of the tax losses by two years to 2025.
A reduction in profits of more than this may result in a partial impairment of the deferred tax asset depending upon the timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences.
The forecast assumptions do not include any incremental tax planning strategies.
Other deferred tax assets The deferred tax asset of 377m 2011: 571m in other entities includes 55m 2011: 144m relating to tax losses carried forward.
Entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year have a total deferred tax asset of 135m 2011: 189m relating to tax losses carried forward and temporary differences.
Recognition is based on profit forecasts which indicate that it is probable that the entities will have future taxable profits against which the losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
There is no net deferred tax asset in the UK.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 249 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 10 Tax continued The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.
The amounts are different from those disclosed on the balance sheet as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1,714m 2011: 1,044m.
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is 2,990m 2011: 2,050m.
These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
Unrecognised deferred tax Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of 28m 2011: 1,163m, gross tax losses of 7,295m 2011: 2,299m which includes capital losses of 3,358m 2011: 2,034m, and unused tax credits of 155m 2011: nil.
Tax losses of 3m 2011: 97m expire within 5 years, 83m 2011: 101m expire within 6 to10 years, 5m 2011: 5m expire within 11 to 20 years and 7,204m 2011: 2,096m can be carried forward indefinitely.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which the Group can utilise benefits.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries and branches where remittance is not contemplated and for those associates and interests in joint ventures where it has been determined that no additional tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 836m 2011: 703m.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain and cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
These risks are managed in accordance with the Groups Tax Risk Framework.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Further detail on the recognition of deferred tax assets is provided on page 247 in the deferred tax assets and liabilities section of this tax note.

When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 389 million 2011: 538 million shares.
In addition, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the dilutive impact of the potential conversion of outstanding options held in respect of Absa Group Limited.
The decrease in the number of potential ordinary shares is primarily driven by the impact of the decrease in the average share price to 2.14 2011: 2.34 on both the 379 million 2011: 379 million unexercised warrants and the 820 million 2011: 867 million outstanding options granted under employee share schemes, which have strike prices ranging from 1.41 to 5.22 with an average of 3.28 2011: 3.71.
The 379 million unexercised warrants as at 31 December 2012 were exercised on 13 February 2013.
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2012, 145 million were anti-dilutive 2011: 248 million.
12 Dividends on Ordinary Shares The Directors have approved a final dividend in respect of 2012 of 3.5p per ordinary share of 25p each, amounting to 426m 2011: 366m, which will be paid on 15 March 2013.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 does not reflect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2013.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 251 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued Assets and liabilities held at fair value The notes included in this section focus on assets and liabilities the Group holds and recognises at fair value.
Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms length transaction with a willing counterparty, which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be an estimated based on available market data.
Detail regarding the Groups approach to managing market risk can be found on pages 332-336.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 15 Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments are contracts whose value is derived from one or more underlying financial instruments or indices defined in the contract.
They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Groups net interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The Groups objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are discussed in the Risk management section on pages 328-329.
Trading derivatives are managed within the Groups market risk management policies, which are outlined on pages 332-336.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from derivative contracts are outlined in the Credit risk section on page 141.
Accounting for derivatives The Group applies IAS 39.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives held for risk management purposes in an effective hedge relationship see hedge accounting below.
This includes terms included in a contract or other financial asset or liability the host, which, had it been a standalone contract, would have met the definition of a derivative.
These are separated from the host and accounted for in the same way as a derivative.
Hedge accounting The Group applies hedge accounting to represent, to the maximum possible extent permitted under accounting standards, the economic effects of its interest and currency risk management strategies.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash flow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash flow hedge accounting For qualifying cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Groups investment in the operation.
Types of derivatives held Foreign exchange derivatives The Groups principal exchange rate-related contracts are forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign currency, usually on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
A currency swap generally involves the exchange, or notional exchange, of equivalent amounts of two currencies and a commitment to exchange interest periodically until the principal amounts are re-exchanged on a future date.
Currency options provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a fixed amount of a currency at a specified exchange rate on or before a future date.
As compensation for assuming the option risk, the option writer generally receives a premium at the start of the option period.
Currency derivatives are primarily designated as hedges of the foreign currency risk of net investments in foreign operations.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 253 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 15 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate derivatives The Groups principal interest rate related contracts are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, basis swaps, caps, floors and swaptions.
Included in this product category are transactions that include combinations of these features.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange fixed rate and floating rate interest by means of periodic payments based upon a notional principal amount and the interest rates defined in the contract.
Certain agreements combine interest rate and foreign currency swap transactions, which may or may not include the exchange of principal amounts.
A basis swap is a form of interest rate swap, in which both parties exchange interest payments based on floating rates, where the floating rates are based upon different underlying reference indices.
In a forward rate agreement, two parties agree a future settlement of the difference between an agreed rate and a future interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount.
The settlement, which generally occurs at the start of the contract period, is the discounted present value of the payment that would otherwise be made at the end of that period.
Interest rate derivatives, designated as cash flow hedges, primarily hedge the exposure to cash flow variability from interest rates of variable rate loans to banks and customers, variable rate debt securities held and highly probable forecast financing transactions and reinvestments.
Interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges primarily hedge the interest rate risk of fixed rate borrowings in issue, fixed rate loans to banks and customers and investments in fixed rate debt securities held.
Credit derivatives The Groups principal credit derivative-related contracts include credit default swaps and total return swaps.
A credit derivative is an arrangement whereby the credit risk of an asset the reference asset is transferred to the seller of protection.
A credit default swap is a contract where the protection seller receives premium or interest-related payments in return for contracting to make payments to the protection buyer upon a defined credit event.
Credit events normally include bankruptcy, payment default on a reference asset or assets, or downgrades by a rating agency.
A total return swap is an instrument whereby the seller of protection receives the full return of the asset, including both the income and change in the capital value of the asset.
The buyer of the protection in return receives a predetermined amount.
Equity derivatives The Groups principal equity-related contracts are equity and stock index swaps and options including warrants, which are equity options listed on an exchange.
An equity swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange periodic payments, based upon a notional principal amount, with one side paying fixed or floating interest and the other side paying based on the actual return of the stock or stock index.
An equity option provides the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock, basket of stocks or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.
The Group also enters into fund-linked derivatives, being swaps and options whose underlyings include mutual funds, hedge funds, indices and multi-asset portfolios.
Commodity derivatives The Groups principal commodity-related derivative contracts are swaps, options, forwards and futures.
The main commodities transacted are base metals, precious metals, oil and oil-related products, power and natural gas.
The Groups total derivative asset and liability position as reported on the balance sheet is as follows: Total derivatives 2012 2011 Notional Fair value Notional Fair value contract contract amount Asset Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities m m m m m m Total derivative assets liabilities held for trading 40,192,194 465,347 459,334 43,095,991 535,306 524,552 Total derivative assets liabilities held for risk management 302,822 3,799 3,134 243,534 3,658 3,358 Derivative assets liabilities 40,495,016 469,146 462,468 43,339,525 538,964 527,910 The fair value of derivative assets decreased by 13% to 469bn reflecting the tightening of credit spreads and trades that matured and terminated during the period.
Derivative asset exposures would be 435bn 2011: 492bn lower than reported under IFRS if netting were permitted for assets and liabilities with the same counterparty or for which we hold cash collateral.
Similarly, derivative liabilities would be 427bn 2011: 478bn lower reflecting counterparty netting and collateral placed.

The Group uses this classification for assets that are not derivatives and are not held for trading purposes or otherwise designated at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost.
Dividends and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in the income statement in net interest income Note 3 or, net investment income Note 6.
On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is also included in net investment income.

Approximately $3.0bn 1.9bn of this amount was recognised as part of the acquisition accounting and is included as an available for sale investment on the balance sheet.
As discussed in Note 29, Barclays entitlement to these assets is the subject of legal proceedings between the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. and Barclays.
As such, there continues to be significant judgement involved in the valuation of this asset and uncertainty relating to the outcome of ongoing appeals.
The Group takes the view that the effective provision of US$1.5bn 0.9bn that is reflected in its estimate of fair value is appropriate.
The valuation of this asset will be kept under review as legal proceedings progress.
17 Financial liabilities designated at fair value Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss In accordance with IAS 39, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income Note 5 and net investment income Note 6.
The Group has the ability to do this when holding the instruments at fair value reduces an accounting mismatch caused by an offsetting liability or asset being held at fair value, is managed by the Group on the basis of its fair value, or includes terms that have substantive derivative characteristics Note 15.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 257 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 18 Fair value of financial instruments Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values The Group applies IAS 39.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition and, depending on the classification of the asset, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable willing parties.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available, and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash flows under the terms of each specific contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities held at fair value, the carrying amount reflects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data, such as spreads on Barclays issued bonds or credit default swaps.
Most market parameters are either directly observable or are implied from instrument prices.
The model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as interpolation when input values do not directly correspond to the most actively traded market trade parameters.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
For valuations that have made use of significant unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction, or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
Various factors influence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependant on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to reasonably possible changes in variables is shown on page 268.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Valuation The fair value is the amount an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
As a wide range of valuation techniques are available, it may be inappropriate to compare the Barclays fair value information to independent market or other financial institutions.
Assumptions changes and different valuation methodologies can have significant impact on fair values which are based on unobservable inputs.
Financial assets The carrying value of financial assets held at amortised cost including loans and advances, and other lending such as reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on pages 271-272.
Loans and advances to banks and customers The carrying value of variable rate loans is assumed to be their fair value based on frequent repricing.
The fair value of the fixed rate loans is determined using discounted cash flows by aggregating for the same or similar products.
This approach is used mainly in Retail and Business Banking and Wealth and Investment Management by applying derived market interest rates on expected cash flows.
These valuation techniques also consider expected credit losses and changes to behavioural profiles.
For the Investment Bank and Corporate Banking, the fair value is determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty.
Credit spreads are based on regional and industry segments and take the contractual maturity of the loan facilities into consideration.
In the absence of counterparty rating, the average of regional and industry segmental credit spreads are applied to the contractual maturity of the loan.
The fair value of asset backed securities and reclassified trading portfolio assets to loans and advances are determined primarily from market quotes and, where these are not available, by alternative techniques including reference to credit spreads on similar assets with similar obligor, broker quotes and other research data.
Financial liabilities The carrying value of financial liabilities held at amortised cost including customer accounts and other deposits such as repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on page 271.
In many cases, the fair value disclosed approximates the carrying value because the instruments are short term in nature or have interest rates that reprice frequently such as customer accounts and other deposits and short term debt securities.
The fair value for deposits repayable on demand is considered to be equal to their carrying value.
The fair value for all other deposits is estimated using discounted cash flows applying either market rates or current rates for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using valuation model.
Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issue concerned or similar issues with terms and conditions.
Valuation inputs IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure requires an entity to classify its financial instruments held at fair value according to a hierarchy that reflects the significance of observable market inputs.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Financial instruments are classified as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
This category includes liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house, actively traded listed equities and actively exchange-traded derivatives.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Financial instruments classified as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
This category includes most investment grade and liquid high yield bonds, certain asset backed securities, US agency securities, government bonds, less actively traded listed equities, bank, corporate and municipal obligations, certain OTC derivatives, certain convertible bonds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, collateralised loan obligations CLOs, most commodities based derivatives, credit derivatives, certain credit default swaps CDSs, most fund units, certain loans, foreign exchange spot and forward transactions and certain issued notes.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 259 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Financial instruments are classified as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
A valuation input is considered observable if it can be directly observed from transactions in an active market, or if there is compelling external evidence demonstrating an executable exit price.
An input is deemed significant if it is shown to contribute more than 10% to the valuation of a financial instrument.
Unobservable input levels are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar nature, historical observations or other analytical techniques.
The Level 3 category includes certain corporate debt securities, distressed debt, private equity investments, commercial real estate loans, certain OTC derivatives requiring complex and unobservable inputs such as correlations and long dated volatilities, certain convertible bonds, certain CDS, derivative exposures to monoline insurers, certain fund units, certain asset backed securities, certain issued notes, certain CDOs synthetic and some cash underlyings, certain CLOs and certain loans.

These methodologies are commonly used by market participants.
Sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable parameters Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
The sensitivity methodologies applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data and the impact of using alternative models.
Sensitivities are calculated without reflecting the impact of any diversification in the portfolio.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on a range, standard deviation or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on alternative market views alongside the impact of using alternative models.
The level of shift or scenarios applied is considered for each product and varied according to the quality of the data and variability of underlying market.
Sensitivity to using alternative models is quantified through scenario analysis and proxy approaches.
The approach adopted in determining these sensitivities has continued to evolve during the year, in the context of changing market conditions.
The valuation techniques used for the main products that are not determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices Level 1, observability and sensitivity analysis for Level 3 are described below.
Commercial real estate loans Description: This legacy portfolio includes lending on a range of commercial property types including retail, hotel, office, multi-family and industrial properties.
Valuation: Performing loans are valued using a spread-based approach, with consideration of characteristics such as property type, geographic location, yields, credit quality and property performance reviews.
Where there is significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, valuation is based on the underlying collateral, whose value is determined through property-specific information such as third party valuation reports and bids for the underlying properties.
Observability: Since each commercial real estate loan is unique in nature and the secondary commercial loan market is relatively illiquid, valuation inputs are generally considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: For performing loans, sensitivity is determined by applying an adjusted spread of 15% for each loan both up and down.
This adjusted spread is derived from loan origination spreads provided by independent market research.
For non-performing loans, a plausible worst-case valuation is determined from the history of third-party valuation reports or bids received.
264 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Asset backed products Description: These are debt and derivative products that are linked to the cash flows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, CDOs, CLOs and derivatives with cash flows linked to securitisations.
Valuation: Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard cash flow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics, and loan attributes such as loan-to-value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Observability: Where an asset backed product does not have an observable market price and the valuation is determined using a model, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on external vendor pricing dispersion or bid offer ranges, defined at position level.
Half of the observed pricing dispersion or bid offer range is multiplied by the market value of the position to calculate the valuation sensitivity.
Where there is no observable dispersion of bid offer data, price movements on appropriate indices are used.
Sensitivity is based on the average of the largest upward and downward price movement in the preceding 12 month period.
Other credit products Description: These products are linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities.
This category includes synthetic CDOs, single name and index CDS and Nth-to-default basket swaps.
Valuation: CDS are valued using a market standard model that incorporates the credit curve as its principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Where credit spreads are unobservable, they are determined with reference to recent transactions or bond spreads from observable issuances of the same issuer or other similar entities as a proxy.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that calculates fair value based on credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates and is calibrated daily.
The model is calibrated to the index tranche market.
Observability: CDS contracts referencing entities that are not actively traded are considered unobservable.
The correlation input to bespoke CDO valuation is considered unobservable as it is proxied from the observable index tranche market.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity of valuations of the illiquid CDS portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying reference asset.
The shift is based upon the average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar CDS.
Bespoke Collateralised Synthetic Obligation CSO sensitivity is calculated using correlation levels derived from the range of contributors to a consensus bespoke service.
Derivative exposure to monoline insurers Description: These products are derivatives through which credit protection has been purchased on structured debt instruments primarily CLOs from monoline insurers.
Valuation: The value of the CDS is derived from the value of the cash instrument that it protects.
A valuation adjustment is then applied to reflect the counterparty credit risk associated with the relevant monoline.
This adjustment is calculated using an assessment of the likely recovery of the protected cash security, which is derived from a scenario-based calculation of the mark-to-market of the instrument using an appropriate valuation model: and the probability of default and loss given default of the monoline counterparty, as estimated from independent fundamental credit analysis.
Observability: Due to the counterparty credit risk associated with these insurers, derivative exposure to monoline counterparty insurers is generally considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is measured by stressing inputs to the counterparty valuation adjustment including our expected exposures and the probability of default of the monoline derivative counterparty.
The modelled expected exposures are stressed by shifting the recovery rate assumptions on the underlying protected assets.
The probability of default of the monoline derivative counterparty is stressed by shifting the internal default curve.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 265 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Non-asset backed debt instruments Description: These are government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, convertible bonds, notes and other non-asset backed bonds.
Within this population, valuation inputs are unobservable for certain convertible bonds and corporate bonds.
Valuation: Liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the closing levels observed in these markets.
Less liquid government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certificates of deposit are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Where there are no observable market prices, fair value is determined by reference to either issuances or CDS spreads of the same issuer as proxy inputs to obtain discounted cash flow amounts.
In the absence of observable bond or CDS spreads for the respective issuer, similar reference assets or sector averages are applied as a proxy the appropriateness of proxies being assessed based on issuer, coupon, maturity and industry.
Convertible bonds are valued using prices observed through broker sources, market data services and trading activity.
Where reliable external sources are not available, fair value is determined using a spread to the equity conversion value or the value of the bond without the additional equity conversion.
The spread level is determined with reference to similar proxy assets.
Fair valued Barclays issued notes are valued using discounted cash flow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various observable input parameters depending on the terms of the instrument.
Any unobservable inputs generally have insignificant impact on the overall valuation.
Observability: Where an observable market price is not available, an instrument is considered unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for the corporate bonds portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying position driven by average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar bonds.
Equity products Description: This category includes listed equities, exchange traded equity derivatives, OTC equity derivatives, preference shares and contracts for difference.
Valuation: OTC equity derivatives valuations are determined using industry standard models.
The models calculate fair value based on input parameters such as stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repo curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
Unobservable model inputs are determined by reference to liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.
Observability: In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is estimated based on the dispersion of consensus data services either directly or through proxies.
Private equity Description: This category includes private equity investments.
Valuation: Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
This requires the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash flow analysis, and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed comparative companies.
Full valuations are performed at least bi-annually, with the portfolio reviewed on a monthly basis for material events that might impact upon fair value.
Observability: Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Model inputs are based on market conditions at the reporting date.
The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature.
However, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Level 3 sensitivity: The relevant valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is estimated by flexing such assumptions to reasonable alternative levels and determining the impact on the resulting valuation.
Funds and fund-linked products Description: This category includes holdings in hedge funds, funds of funds, and fund derivatives.
Fund derivatives are derivatives whose underlyings include mutual funds, hedge funds, fund indices and multi-asset portfolios.
They are valued using underlying fund prices, yield curves and other available market information.
Valuation: In general, fund holdings are valued based on the latest available valuation received from the fund administrator.
In the case of illiquid fund holdings the valuation will take account of all available information in relation to the underlying fund or collection of funds and maybe adjusted relative to the performance of relevant index benchmarks.
Observability: Funds are deemed unobservable where the fund is either suspended, in wind-down, has a redemption restriction that severely affects liquidity, or where the latest net asset value from the fund administrators is more than three months old.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is calculated on an individual fund basis using a loss based scenario approach which factors in the underlying assets of the specific fund and assumed recovery rates.
Foreign exchange products Description: These products are derivatives linked to the foreign exchange market.
This category includes foreign exchange FX forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
Exotic derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models.
Valuation: Input parameters include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Unobservable model inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk profile.
Observability: Certain correlations and long dated forward and volatilities are unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Interest rate products Description: These are products linked to interest rates or inflation indices.
This category includes interest rate and inflation swaps, swaptions, caps, floors, inflation options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate products are valued using standard discounted cash flow techniques.
Valuation: Interest rate derivative cash flows are valued using interest rate yield curves whereby observable market data is used to construct the term structure of forward rates.
This is then used to project and discount future cash flows based on the parameters of the trade.
Instruments with optionality are valued using volatilities implied from market observable inputs.
Exotic interest rate derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models based on observable market parameters which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
Where unobservable, a parameter will be set with reference to an observable proxy.
Inflation forward curves and interest rate yield curves are extrapolated beyond observable tenors.
Balance guaranteed swaps are valued using cash flow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying asset performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities and third party pricing sources.
Prepayment is projected based on observing historic prepayment.
Observability: Inflation forward curves and interest rate yield curves are observable up to liquid maturities after which they are deemed unobservable.
Commodity products Description: These products are exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and refined products, agricultural, power and natural gas.
Valuation: The valuations of certain commodity swaps and options are determined using models incorporating discounting of cash flows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatilities implied from market observable inputs and tenor correlation.
Unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products or by applying extrapolation techniques from the observable market.
Observability: Within this population, certain forward curves and volatilities for longer dated exposures are unobservable.
Level 3 sensitivity: Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over two years.
The estimate is calculated using data for short dated parameter curves to generate best and worst case scenarios.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
Other Description: This category is largely made up of fixed rate loans, which are valued using models that discount expected future cash flows.
The receivables resulting from the acquisition of the North American businesses of Lehman Brothers is also included within Other.
For more details, refer to Note 29 Legal Proceedings.
Valuation: Fixed rate loans are valued using models that calculate fair value based on observable interest rates and unobservable credit spreads.
Unobservable credit spreads are modelled according to issuer credit quality.
Derived levels are validated against any origination activity that occurs.
Level 3 sensitivity: The sensitivity for fixed rate loans is calculated by applying a 25% shift in borrower credit spreads.
No stress has been applied to the receivables relating to the Lehman acquisition Note 29.
The sensitivity inherent in the measurement of the receivables is akin to a litigation provision.
Due to this, an upside and downside stress on a basis comparable with the other assets cannot be applied.

Discounting approaches for derivative instruments During 2011, in line with market practice, the methodology for valuing certain collateralised interest rate products, principally in the Fixed Income Rates business, was amended to reflect the impact of cheapest to deliver collateral on discounting curves, where counterparty Credit Support Annex CSA agreements specify the right of the counterparty posting collateral to choose the currency of collateral posted.
During 2012, the valuation of collateralised derivatives in other business areas was updated to reflect CSA aware discounting.
The December 2012 impact of this transition was not material to the overall valuation.
Additionally, during 2012, a fair value adjustment was applied to account for the impact of incorporating the cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised derivatives.
This was driven by the impact of discounting future expected uncollateralised cash flows to reflect the cost of funding, taking into account observed traded levels on uncollateralised derivatives and other relevant factors.
The Group continues to monitor market practices and activity to ensure the approach to discounting in derivative valuation remains appropriate.
Complex derivative instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes significantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered when determining Barclays own fair value estimates.
268 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 18 Fair value of financial instruments continued Fair value adjustments The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below: Bid-offer valuation adjustments For assets and liabilities where the Group is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices respectively.
Bid-offer adjustments reflect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact that they are managed on a portfolio basis.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data.
For those assets and liabilities where the firm is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets, the mid price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost.
Uncertainty adjustments Market data input for exotic derivatives may not have a directly observable bid-offer spread.
In such instances, an uncertainty adjustment is applied as a proxy for the bid offer adjustment.
An example of this is correlation risk where an adjustment is required to reflect the possible range of values that market participants apply.
The uncertainty adjustment may be determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario analysis or historical analysis.
Credit and debit valuation adjustments Credit valuation adjustments CVAs and debit valuation adjustments DVAs are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are modelled for OTC derivatives across all asset classes.
Calculations are derived from estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, on a counterparty basis.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, monolines, sovereigns and sovereign agencies, supranationals, and special-purpose vehicles.
Exposure at default for CVA and DVA is generally based on expected exposure, estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors.
For some complex products, where this approach is not feasible, simplifying assumptions are made, either through proxying with a more vanilla structure, or using current or scenario-based mark-to-market as an estimate of future exposure.
Where strong collateralisation agreement exists as a mitigant to counterparty risk, the exposure is set to zero.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
For counterparties where this information is not available, or considered unreliable due to the nature of the exposure, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 200m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors may lead to a systematic bias in the valuation of counterparty credit risk, termed wrong-way or right-way risk.
This is not incorporated into the CVA calculation, but is monitored regularly via scenario analysis and has been found to be immaterial.
Model valuation adjustments Valuation models are reviewed under the firms model governance framework.
This process identifies the assumptions used and any model limitations for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew.
Where necessary, fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account.
Model valuation adjustments are dependant on the size of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all known risk factors.
All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis.
Own credit adjustments The carrying amount of issued notes that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option is adjusted to reflect the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
For funded instruments such as issued notes, mid-level credit spreads on Barclays issued bonds are the basis for this adjustment.
At 31 December 2012, the own credit adjustment arose from the fair valuation of Barclays financial liabilities designated at fair value.
Barclays credit spreads tightened during 2012, leading to a charge of 4,579m 2011: gain of 2,708m from the fair value of changes primarily in own credit itself but also reflecting the effects of foreign exchange rates, time decay and trade activity.

This process covers all fair value positions and is a key control in ensuring the material accuracy of valuations.
Price verification uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market.
The characteristics against which the data source is assessed are independence, reliability, consistency with other sources and evidence that the data represents an executable price.
The most current data available at balance sheet date is used.
Where significant variances are noted in the independent price verification process, an adjustment is taken to the fair value position.
Additional fair value adjustments may be taken to reflect such factors as bid-offer spreads, market data uncertainty, model limitations and counterparty risk further detail on these fair value adjustments is disclosed on page 269.
Governance over the valuation process is the responsibility of the Valuation Committee.
This Committee meets monthly and is responsible for overseeing valuation and fair value adjustment policy within Corporate and Investment Banking and this is the forum to which valuation issues are escalated.
The Valuation Committee delegates more detailed review to the following five sub-committees: Independent Valuations, Legacy and Other Assets, Litigation Risk, Models and Governance.
The Independent Valuations Sub-committee reviews the results of the independent price verification and fair value adjustments process on a monthly basis.
This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing fair value adjustments and methodologies, independent price verification results, limits and valuation uncertainty.
The Legacy and Other Assets Sub-committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation and measurement issues arising in legacy assets, certain AFS positions and other assets as delegated by the Valuation Committee.
The Litigation Risk Sub-committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation and measurement issues arising from legal risks within Corporate and Investment Banking.
The Models Sub-committee is responsible for overseeing policies and controls related to the use of valuation models.
This includes but is not limited to review of global model risk reports, the trade approval process and model validation, model-related fair value adjustments, and independent price verification variances or collateral disputes relating to model usage.
The Governance Sub-committee is responsible for overseeing the governance of valuation processes, policies and procedures.
This Sub-committee monitors the development of the Valuation control framework, completeness of balance sheet oversight and appropriate representation of senior management at the Valuation Committee and each of the above referenced sub-committees.
Regulatory and accounting issues related to fair value are assessed by the Governance Sub-committee.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Quoted market prices are not available for many of the financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value and the Group uses a variety of techniques to estimate the fair value.
The above note describes the more judgemental aspects of valuation in the period, including: credit valuation adjustments on monoline exposures, commercial real estate loans, private equity investments, and fair value loans to government and business and other services.

20 Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased assets on the lessee.
Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reflect a constant periodic rate of return.
Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances to customers.
The Group specialises in asset-based lending and works with a broad range of international technology, industrial equipment and commercial companies to provide customised finance programmes to assist manufacturers, dealers and distributors of assets.

As at 31 December 2012, the total future minimum payments under finance leases were 35m 2011: 64m, of which 5m 2011: 10m was due within one year.
As at 31 December 2012, the carrying amount of assets held under finance leases was 22m 2011: 28m.
21 Reclassification of financial assets held for trading Accounting for the reclassification of financial assets held for trading In accordance with IAS 39, where the Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held for trading classification and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the definition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.
Prior to 2010, the Group reclassified certain financial assets, originally classified as held for trading but subsequently deemed to be not held for trading purposes, to loans and receivables.
The carrying value of the securities reclassified into loans and receivables has decreased from 7,652m to 5,188m primarily as a result of sales and paydowns of the underlying securities offset by increases due to the reversal of the discount on reclassification and FX movements.
Sales of securities from the 16 December 2008 reclassification totalled 151m 2011: 91m and sales of securities from the 25 November 2009 reclassification totalled 1,316m 2011: 482m.

22 Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing Reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing or similar transaction are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a fixed price in the future.
Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing The Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included on the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost.
The Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost.

23 Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease a Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% a Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and fittings and other equipment 9-20% Investment property The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at fair value at each balance sheet date reflecting market conditions at the reporting date.
Gains and losses on remeasurement are included in the income statement.
Note a Where leasehold property has a remaining useful life of less than 15 years, costs of adaptation and installed equipment are depreciated over the remaining life of the lease.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reflect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash flow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualified independent valuers.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 24 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of interest that reflects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or the cash generating units fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets The accounting standard that the Group applies in accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill is IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets include brands, customer lists, internally generated software, licences and other contracts and core deposit intangibles.
They are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow from their use.
Intangible assets are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less amortisation and provision for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reflects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash flows, generally over 4-25 years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indicators that impairment may have occurred.

This includes the identification of independent cash generating units and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisation.
Cash flow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity and the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash flows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit require the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash flows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long term sustainable cash flows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances and judgement.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimation of future cash flows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash flow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
The most significant amounts of intangible assets relate to Absa and Lehman Brothers North American businesses.
Impairment testing of goodwill Total impairment charges of nil have been recognised during the year.
Impairment charges of 597m recognised in 2011 related to the goodwill held in FirstPlus and Spain which was not supportable based on value in use calculations.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 1,247m 2011: 1,264m was allocated to multiple cash generating units which are not considered individually significant.
UKRBB At 31 December 2012, goodwill relating to Woolwich was 3,130m 2011: 3,130m of the total UKRBB balance.
The carrying value of the cash generating unit CGU is determined using an allocation of total Group shareholder funds excluding goodwill based on the CGUs share of risk weighted assets before goodwill balances are added back.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five-year period, with a terminal growth rate of 2% 2011: 3% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 12% 2011: 13%.
Based on these assumptions, the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 9,334m 2011: 8,683m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 1,637m 2011: 1,399m and 1,115m 2011: 939m respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 1,767m 2011: 1,538m.
Africa RBB At 31 December 2012, goodwill relating to Absa RBB was 829m 2011: 911m of the total Africa RBB balance.
The carrying value of the CGU has been determined by using net asset value.
The recoverable amount of the Absa Group has been determined using cash flow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five year period, with a terminal growth rate of 6% 2011: 6% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13% 2011: 14%.
The recoverable amount calculated based on value in use exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 3,133m 2011: 4,746m.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the recoverable amount by 813m 2011: 948m and 623m 2011: 702m respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash flows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 643m 2011: 842m.

An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Group recognises leased assets on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease receivables The Group acts as lessor, whereby items of plant and equipment are purchased and then leased to third parties under arrangements qualifying as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2012 was 4m 2011: 14m.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various offices, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reflect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
26 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities Accounting for insurance contracts The Group applies IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to its insurance contracts.
An insurance contract is a contract that compensates a third party against a loss from non-financial risk.
Some wealth management and other products, such as life assurance contracts, combine investment and insurance features: these are treated as insurance contracts when they pay benefits that are at least 5% more than they would pay if the insured event does not occur.
Insurance liabilities include current best estimates of future contractual cash flows, claims handling, and administration costs in respect of claims.
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities.
Where a deficiency is highlighted by the tests, insurance liabilities are increased, any deficiency being recognised in the income statement.
Insurance premium revenue is recognised in the income statement in the period earned, net of reinsurance premiums payable, in net premiums from insurance contracts.
Increases and decreases in insurance liabilities are recognised in the income statement in net claims and benefits on insurance contracts.

Insurance contract liabilities associated with the Groups short term non-life business are 126m 2011: 118m.
The maximum amounts payable under all of the Groups insurance products, ignoring the probability of insured events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies, were 102bn 2011: 104bn or 79bn 2011: 82bn after reinsurance.
Of this insured risk, 87bn 2011: 89bn or 67bn 2011: 69bn after reinsurances was concentrated in short term insurance contracts in Africa.
The impact to the income statement and equity under a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the insurance liabilities would be 7m 2011: 8m.

Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists: for example, when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements Payment Protection Insurance Redress Following the conclusion of the 2011 judicial review, a provision for PPI redress of 1.0bn was raised in May 2011 based on FSA guidelines and historic industry experience in resolving similar claims.
Subsequently, further provisions of 300m were raised in March 2012, 700m in September 2012 and 600m in December 2012, bringing the total provision for PPI redress to 2.6bn.
As at 31 December 2012 1.6bn of the provision has been utilised, including gesture of goodwill payments to customers with accrued claims at the conclusion of the judicial review, leaving a residual provision of 1.0bn.
a As of 31 December 2012, 1.1m customer initiated claims have been received and processed.
The volume of claims received has declined since the peak in May 2012, although the rate of decline has been lower than previously expected.
In addition to customer initiated claims, in August 2012, in accordance with regulatory standards, Barclays commenced proactive mailing of the holders of approximately 750,000 policies.
Of this population approximately 100,000 have been mailed as at 31 December and it is anticipated that the remainder will be completed by June 2013.
To date Barclays has upheld on average 39% of claims received, excluding payment of gestures of goodwill and reflecting a high proportion of claims for which no PPI policy exists.
The average redress per valid claim to date is 2,750, comprising, where applicable, the refund of premium, compound interest charged and interest of 8%.
The current provision is calculated based on a number of key assumptions which continue to involve significant management judgement: Customer initiated claim volumes claims received not yet processed and an estimate of future claims initiated by customers where the volume is anticipated to continue to decline over time: Proactive response rate volume of claims in response to proactive mailing: Uphold rate the percentage of claims that are upheld as being valid upon review: and Average claim redress the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims based on the type and age of the policy policies.
The provision also includes an estimate of the Groups claims handling costs and those costs associated with claims that are subsequently referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
Note a Total claims received to date including those for which no PPI policy exists and excluding responses to proactive mailing.

During the second half of 2012, Barclays completed a pilot review of a sample of individual cases.
On 31 January 2013, the FSA issued a report on the findings of the pilot, along with those conducted by a number of other banks.
The report included a number of changes and clarifications to the requirements under which the main review and redress exercise should be conducted.
Barclays has agreed to conduct the exercise in line with the approach set out in this report and will commence shortly.
Our current analysis suggests that there are approximately 4,000 private or retail classified customers to which interest rate hedging products were sold within the relevant timeframe, of which approximately 3,000 are likely to be categorised as non-sophisticated under the terms of the agreement.
As at 30 June 2012, a provision of 450m was recognised, reflecting managements initial estimate of future redress to customers categorised as non-sophisticated and related costs.
As at 31 December 2012, an additional provision of 400m has been recognised, reflecting the results of the pilot review, an updated estimate of administrative costs and the greater clarity afforded by the implementation requirements agreed with the FSA.
The provision recognised in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2012 is 814m, after utilisation of 36m during 2012, primarily related to administrative costs.
The pilot exercise provides the best currently available information upon which to base an estimate.
However, the ultimate cost of the exercise will depend on the extent and nature of redress payable across the impacted population.
This will be impacted by a number of factors, including: The number of customers for which Barclays is deemed not to have complied with relevant regulatory requirements at the time of sale: The nature of any redress offered by Barclays, in particular whether existing products are terminated or replaced with alternative products: and The level of reasonably foreseeable consequential loss payable.
The appropriate provision level will be kept under ongoing review as the main redress and review exercise progresses.
28 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting for contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 28 Contingent liabilities and commitments continued Securities Lending Arrangements Up to the disposal of Barclays Global Investors on 1 December 2009, the Group facilitated securities lending arrangements for its managed investment funds whereby securities held by funds under management were lent to third parties.
Borrowers provided cash or investment grade assets as collateral equal to 100% of the market value of the securities lent plus a margin of 2% 10%.
The Group agreed with BlackRock, Inc. to continue to provide indemnities to support these arrangements until 30 November 2012.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme The Financial Services Compensation Scheme the FSCS is the UKs compensation scheme for customers of authorised institutions that are unable to pay claims.
It provides compensation to depositors in the event that UK licensed deposit taking institutions are unable to meet their claims.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities totalling approximately 18bn provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
In April 2012, the FSCS agreed revised terms on the loan facilities including a 70bps increase in the interest rate payable to 12 month LIBOR plus 100 bps.
This rate will be subject to a floor equal to the HM Treasurys own cost of borrowing.
The facilities are expected to be repaid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 0.8bn.
The FSCS has announced it intends to recover this shortfall by levying the industry in instalments across 2013, 2014 and 2015, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
Barclays has included an accrual of 156m in other liabilities as at 31 December 2012 2011: 58m in respect of the Barclays portion of the total levies raised by the FSCS.
US Mortgage Activities Barclays activities within the US residential mortgage sector during the period of 2005 through 2008 included: sponsoring and underwriting of approximately $39bn of private-label securitisations: underwriting of approximately $34bn of other private-label securitisations: sales of approximately $0.2bn of loans to government sponsored enterprises GSEs and sales of approximately $3bn of loans to others.
Some of the loans sold by Barclays were originated by a Barclays subsidiary.
Barclays also performed servicing activities through its US residential mortgage servicing business which Barclays acquired in Q4 2006 and subsequently sold in Q3 2010.
In connection with Barclays loan sales and sponsored private-label securitisations, Barclays provided certain loan level representations and warranties R&Ws generally relating to the underlying borrower, the property, mortgage documentation and or compliance with law.
Under certain circumstances, Barclays may be required to repurchase the related loans or make other payments related to such loans if the R&Ws are breached.
Barclays was the sole provider of R&Ws with respect to approximately $5bn of Barclays sponsored securitisations, approximately $0.2bn of sales of loans to GSEs and approximately $3bn of loans sold to others.
Other than approximately $1bn of loans sold to others for which R&Ws expired prior to 2012, there are no expiration provisions applicable to the R&Ws made by Barclays.
Barclays R&Ws with respect to loans sold to others are related to loans that were generally sold at significant discounts and contained more limited R&Ws than loans sold to GSEs and in respect of the approximately $5bn of Barclays sponsored securitisations discussed above.
R&Ws on the remaining approximately $34bn of Barclays sponsored securitisations were primarily provided by third party originators directly to the securitisation trusts with Barclays, as depositor to the securitisation trusts, providing more limited R&Ws.
Total unresolved repurchase requests associated with all R&Ws made by Barclays on loans sold to GSEs and others and private-label activities were $0.4bn at 31 December 2012.
Barclays currently has no provisions with respect to such repurchase requests, given Barclays analysis of such requests and Barclays belief as to applicable defences with respect thereto.
Based upon a large number of defaults occurring in US residential mortgages, there is a potential for additional requests for repurchases.
Claims against Barclays as an underwriter of RMBS offerings have been brought in certain civil actions.
Additionally, Barclays has received inquiries from various regulatory and governmental authorities regarding its mortgage-related activities and is cooperating with such inquiries.
It is not practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the potential exposure in relation to Barclays US Mortgage activities.
Further details on contingent liabilities relating to Legal Proceedings and Competition and Regulatory Matters are held in Note 29 and 30 respectively.
29 Legal Proceedings Lehman Brothers On 15 September 2009, motions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York the Bankruptcy Court by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LBHI, the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. the Trustee and the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. the Committee.
All three motions challenged certain aspects of the transaction pursuant to which BCI and other companies in the Group acquired most of the assets of Lehman Brothers Inc. LBI in September 2008 and the Court Order approving such sale the Sale.
The claimants were seeking an order voiding the transfer of certain assets to BCI: requiring BCI to return to the LBI estate alleged excess value BCI received: and declaring that BCI is not entitled to certain assets that it claims pursuant to the sale documents and Order approving the Sale the Rule 60 Claims.
On 16 November 2009, LBHI, the Trustee and the Committee filed separate complaints in the Bankruptcy Court asserting claims against BCI based on the same underlying allegations as the pending motions and seeking relief similar to that which is requested in the motions.
On 29 January 2010, BCI filed its response to the motions and also filed a motion seeking delivery of certain assets that LBHI and LBI have failed to deliver as required by the sale documents and the Court Order approving the Sale together with the Trustees competing claims to those assets, the Contract Claims.
Approximately $4.5bn 2.8bn of the assets acquired as part of the acquisition had not been received by 31 December 2012, approximately $3.0bn 1.9bn of which were recognised as part of the accounting for the acquisition and are included in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2012.
This results in an effective provision of $1.5bn 0.9bn against the uncertainty inherent in the litigation and issues relating to the recovery of certain assets held by institutions outside the United States.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 281 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 29 Legal Proceedings continued On 22 February 2011, the Bankruptcy Court issued its Opinion in relation to these matters, rejecting the Rule 60 Claims and deciding some of the Contract Claims in the Trustees favour and some in favour of BCI.
On 15 July 2011, the Bankruptcy Court entered final Orders implementing its Opinion.
Barclays and the Trustee each appealed the Bankruptcy Courts adverse rulings on the Contract Claims to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York the District Court.
LBHI and the Committee did not pursue an appeal from the Bankruptcy Courts ruling on the Rule 60 Claims.
After briefing and argument, the District Court issued its Opinion on 5 June 2012 in which it reversed one of the Bankruptcy Courts rulings on the Contract Claims that had been adverse to Barclays and affirmed the Bankruptcy Courts other rulings on the Contract Claims.
On 17 July 2012, the District Court issued an amended Opinion, correcting certain errors but not otherwise affecting the rulings, and an agreed Judgment implementing the rulings in the Opinion.
Barclays and the Trustee have each appealed the adverse rulings of the District Court to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Under the Judgment of the District Court, Barclays is entitled to receive: $1.1bn 0.7bn from the Trustee in respect of clearance box assets: property held at various institutions to secure obligations under the exchange-traded derivatives transferred to Barclays in the Sale the ETD Margin, subject to the proviso that Barclays will be entitled to receive $507m 0.3bn of the ETD Margin only if and to the extent the Trustee has assets available once the Trustee has satisfied all of LBIs customer claims: and $769m 0.5bn from the Trustee in respect of LBIs 15c3-3 reserve account assets only if and to the extent the Trustee has assets available once the Trustee has satisfied all of LBIs customer claims.
A portion of the ETD Margin which has not yet been recovered by Barclays or the Trustee is held or owed by certain institutions outside the United States including several Lehman affiliates that are subject to insolvency or similar proceedings.
Barclays cannot reliably estimate at this time how much of the ETD Margin held or owed by such institutions Barclays is ultimately likely to receive.
Further, Barclays cannot reliably estimate at this time if and to the extent the Trustee will have assets remaining available to it to pay Barclays the $507m 0.3bn in respect of ETD Margin or the $769m 0.5bn in respect of LBIs 15c3-3 reserve account assets after satisfying all of LBIs customer claims.
In this regard, the Trustee announced in October 2012 that if his proposed settlement agreements with LBHI and with the Administrator for the liquidation of Lehman Brothers Inc. Europe are approved by the relevant courts, then the Trustee should be in position to satisfy all customer claims and make meaningful distributions to creditors without having to use any of the assets that Barclays claims.
If the District Courts rulings were to be unaffected by future proceedings, conservatively assuming no recovery by Barclays of any of the ETD Margin not yet recovered by Barclays or the Trustee that is held or owed by institutions outside the United States and no recovery by Barclays of the $507m 0.3bn in respect of ETD Margin or the $769m 0.5bn in respect of LBIs 15c3-3 reserve account assets, Barclays estimates its loss would be approximately $0.9bn 0.5bn.
Under the same scenario, but assuming the Trustees proposed settlement agreements with LBHI and the Administrator for the liquidation of Lehman Brothers Inc. Europe are implemented, and result in the receipt by Barclays of the $507m ETD Margin and $769m in respect of the 15c3-3 reserve account assets, Barclays estimates its profit would be approximately $0.4bn 0.2bn plus the value of any recovery of the ETD Margin held or owed by institutions outside of the United States.
In this context, Barclays is satisfied with the valuation of the asset recognised on its balance sheet and the resulting level of effective provision.
American Depositary Shares Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays PLC and various current and former members of Barclays PLCs Board of Directors have been named as defendants in five proposed securities class actions which have been consolidated pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York the Court.
The consolidated amended complaint, dated 12 February 2010, alleges that the registration statements relating to American Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock, Series 2, 3, 4 and 5 the ADS offered by Barclays Bank PLC at various times between 2006 and 2008 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things Barclays portfolio of mortgage-related including US subprimerelated securities, Barclays exposure to mortgage and credit market risk and Barclays financial condition.
The consolidated amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12 a 2 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.
On 5 January 2011, the Court issued an Order and, on 7 January 2011, Judgment was entered, granting the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety and closing the case.
On 4 February 2011, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to reconsider in part its dismissal order.
On 31 May 2011, the Court denied in full the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.
The plaintiffs have appealed both decisions the grant of the defendants motion to dismiss and the denial of the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Oral argument was held on 18 October 2012.
Barclays considers that these ADS-related claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously.
It is not practicable to estimate Barclays possible loss in relation to these claims or any effect that they might have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
US Federal Housing Finance Agency and Other Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation The United States Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA, acting for two US government sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collectively, the GSEs, filed lawsuits against 17 financial institutions in connection with the GSEs purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS.
The lawsuits allege, amongst other things, that the RMBS offering materials contained materially false and misleading statements and or omissions.
Barclays Bank PLC and or certain of its affiliates or former employees are named in two of these lawsuits, relating to sales between 2005 and 2007 of RMBS, in which BCI was lead or co-lead underwriter.
Both complaints demand, amongst other things: rescission and recovery of the consideration paid for the RMBS: and recovery for the GSEs alleged monetary losses arising out of their ownership of the RMBS.
The complaints are similar to other civil actions filed against Barclays Bank and or certain of its affiliates by other plaintiffs, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Cambridge Place Investment Management, Inc. HSH Nordbank AG and affiliates, Sealink Funding Limited, Landesbank Baden-Wrttemberg and affiliates, Deutsche  AG and affiliates, Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, Royal Park Investments SA NV, Bayerische Landesbank, John Hancock Life Insurance Company and affiliates, Prudential Life Insurance Company of America and affiliates and the National Credit Union Administration relating to purchases of RMBS.
Barclays considers that the claims against it are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.
282 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 29 Legal Proceedings continued The original amount of RMBS related to the claims against Barclays in the FHFA cases and the other civil actions against Barclays Bank PLC and or certain of its affiliates totalled approximately $8.5bn, of which approximately $2.7bn was outstanding as at 31 December 2012.
Cumulative losses reported on these RMBS as at 31 December 2012 were approximately $0.4bn.
If Barclays were to lose these cases Barclays believes it could incur a loss of up to the outstanding amount of the RMBS at the time of Judgment taking into account further principal payments after 31 December 2012, plus any cumulative losses on the RMBS at such time and any interest, fees and costs, less the market value of the RMBS at such time.
Barclays has estimated the total market value of the RMBS as at 31 December 2012 to be approximately $1.6bn.
Barclays may be entitled to indemnification for a portion of any losses.
These figures do not include two related class actions brought on behalf of a putative class of investors in RMBS issued by Countrywide and underwritten by BCI and other underwriters, in which Barclays is indemnified by Countrywide.
Devonshire Trust On 13 January 2009, Barclays commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court the Court seeking an order that its early terminations earlier that day of two credit default swaps under an ISDA Master Agreement with the Devonshire Trust Devonshire, an asset-backed commercial paper conduit trust, were valid.
On the same day, Devonshire purported to terminate the swaps on the ground that Barclays had failed to provide liquidity support to Devonshires commercial paper when required to do so.
On 7 September 2011, the Court ruled that Barclays early terminations were invalid, Devonshires early terminations were valid and, consequently, Devonshire was entitled to receive back from Barclays cash collateral of approximately C$533m together with accrued interest thereon.
Barclays is appealing the Courts decision.
If the Courts decision were to be unaffected by future proceedings, Barclays estimates that its loss would be approximately C$500m, less any impairment provisions taken by Barclays for this matter.
LIBOR Civil Actions Barclays and other banks have been named as defendants in class action and non-class action lawsuits pending in United States Federal Courts in connection with their roles as contributor panel banks to US Dollar LIBOR, the first of which was filed on 15 April 2011.
The complaints are substantially similar and allege, amongst other things, that Barclays and the other banks individually and collectively violated various provisions of the Sherman Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act RICO and various state laws by suppressing or otherwise manipulating US Dollar LIBOR rates.
The lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages and trebling of damages under the Sherman and RICO Acts.
The proposed class actions purport to be brought on behalf of amongst others plaintiffs that i engaged in US Dollar LIBOR-linked over-the-counter transactions: ii purchased US Dollar LIBOR-linked financial instruments on an exchange: iii purchased US Dollar LIBOR-linked debt securities: iv purchased adjustable-rate mortgages linked to US Dollar LIBOR: or v issued loans linked to US Dollar LIBOR.
An additional class action was commenced on 30 April 2012 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York SDNY against Barclays and other Japanese Yen LIBOR panel banks by plaintiffs involved in exchange-traded derivatives.
The complaint also names members of the Japanese Bankers Associations Euroyen TIBOR panel, of which Barclays is not a member.
The complaint alleges, amongst other things, manipulation of the Euroyen TIBOR and Yen LIBOR rates and breaches of US antitrust laws between 2006 and 2010.
A further class action was commenced on 6 July 2012 in the SDNY against Barclays and other EURIBOR panel banks by plaintiffs that purchased or sold EURIBOR-related financial instruments.
The complaint alleges, amongst other things, manipulation of the EURIBOR rate and breaches of the Sherman Act and the Commodity Exchange Act beginning as early as 1 January 2005 and continuing through to 31 December 2009.
On 23 August 2012, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the complaint.
On 21 February 2013, a class action was commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against Barclays and other EURIBOR panel banks by plaintiffs that purchased or sold a NYSE LIFFE EURIBOR futures contract.
The complaint alleges manipulation of the EURIBOR rate and violations of the Sherman Act beginning as early as 1 June 2005 and continuing through 30 June 2010.
In addition, Barclays has been granted conditional leniency from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
Barclays has also been named as a defendant along with four current and former Barclays officers and directors in a proposed securities class action pending in the SDNY in connection with Barclays role as a contributor panel bank to LIBOR.
The complaint principally alleges that Barclays Annual Reports for the years 2006-2011 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things Barclays compliance with its operational risk management processes and certain laws and regulations.
The complaint also alleges that Barclays daily US Dollar LIBOR submissions themselves constituted false statements in violation of US securities law.
The complaint is brought on behalf of a proposed class consisting of all persons or entities other than the defendants that purchased Barclays sponsored American Depositary Receipts on an American securities exchange between 10 July 2007 and 27 June 2012.
The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10 b and 20 a of the Securities Exchange Act 1934.
It is not practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the potential exposure of any of the actions described or what effect if any that they might have upon operating results, cash flows or Barclays financial position in any particular period.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 283 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 29 Legal Proceedings continued Other Barclays is engaged in various other legal proceedings both in the United Kingdom and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the United States, involving claims by and against it which arise in the ordinary course of business, including debt collection, consumer claims and contractual disputes.
Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash flows or the financial position of the Group and Barclays has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these claims either because they cannot reliably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the conduct of the claims.
Provisions have been recognised for those cases where Barclays is able reliably to estimate the probable loss where the probable loss is not fide minimis.
30 Competition and regulatory matters This note highlights some of the key competition and regulatory challenges facing Barclays, many of which are beyond our control.
The extent of the impact of these matters on Barclays and the impact on Barclays of any other competition and regulatory matters in which Barclays is or may in the future become involved cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our businesses and earnings.
Regulatory change There is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the banking industry which, in some cases, is leading to increased or changing regulation which is likely to have a significant effect on the industry.
On 4 February 2013, the UK Government introduced the Financial Services Banking Reform Bill the Bill to the House of Commons.
The Bill would give the UK authorities the powers to implement the key recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking by requiring, amongst other things: i the separation of the UK and EEA retail banking activities of UK banks in a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity so called ring fencing and ii the increase of the loss-absorbing capacity of ring-fenced banks and UK headquartered global systemically important banks to levels higher than the Basel 3 guidelines.
The Bill would also give depositors protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme preference if a bank enters insolvency.
At the same time, the Government announced that it will be bringing forward amendments to the Bill to establish a reserve power allowing the regulator, with approval from the Government, to enforce full separation under certain circumstances.
The Government is expected to publish draft secondary legislation by late summer this year.
The UK Government intends that primary and secondary legislation will be in place by the end of this Parliament May 2015 and that UK banks will be required to be compliant by 1 January 2019.
The US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains far reaching regulatory reform, including potential reform of the regulatory regime for foreign banks operating in the US which may, amongst other things, require the US subsidiaries of foreign banks to be held under a US intermediate holding company subject to a comprehensive set of prudential and supervisory requirements in the US.
The full impact on Barclays businesses and markets will not be known until the principal implementing rules are adopted in final form by governmental authorities, a process which is underway and which will take effect over several years.
Interchange The Office of Fair Trading, as well as other competition authorities elsewhere in Europe, continues to investigate Visa and MasterCard credit and debit interchange rates.
These investigations may have an impact on the consumer credit industry as well as having the potential for the imposition of fines.
The timing of these cases is uncertain and it is not possible to provide an estimate of the potential financial impact of this matter on Barclays.
London Interbank Offered Rate The UK Financial Services Authority the FSA, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission the CFTC, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the US Department of Justice Fraud Section the DOJ-FS and Antitrust Division, the European Commission, the UK Serious Fraud Office and various US state attorneys general are amongst various authorities conducting investigations the Investigations into submissions made by Barclays and other panel members to the bodies that set various interbank offered rates, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Euro Interbank Offered Rate EURIBOR.
On 27 June 2012, Barclays announced that it had reached settlements with the FSA, the CFTC and the DOJ-FS in relation to their Investigations and Barclays had agreed to pay total penalties of 290m Pounds Sterling equivalent, which have been reflected in operating expenses for 2012.
The settlements were made by entry into a Settlement Agreement with the FSA, a Non-Prosecution Agreement NPA with the DOJ-FS and a Settlement Order Agreement with the CFTC.
In addition, Barclays has been granted conditional leniency from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice in connection with potential US antitrust law violations with respect to financial instruments that reference EURIBOR.
The terms of the Settlement Agreement with the FSA are confidential.
However, the Final Notice of the FSA, which imposed a financial penalty of 59.5m, is publicly available on the website of the FSA.
This sets out the FSAs reasoning for the penalty, references the settlement principles and sets out the factual context and justification for the terms imposed.
Summaries of the NPA and the CFTC Order are set out below.
The full text of the NPA and the CFTC Order are publicly available on the websites of the DOJ and the CFTC, respectively.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 30 Competition and regulatory matters continued In addition to a $200m civil monetary penalty, the CFTC Order requires Barclays to cease and desist from further violations of specified provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act and take specified steps to ensure the integrity and reliability of its benchmark interest rate submissions, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, and improve related internal controls.
Amongst other things, the CFTC Order requires Barclays to: Make its submissions based on certain specified factors, with Barclays transactions being given the greatest weight, subject to certain specified adjustments and considerations: Implement firewalls to prevent improper communications including between traders and submitters: Prepare and retain certain documents concerning submissions and retain relevant communications: Implement auditing, monitoring and training measures concerning its submissions and related processes: Make regular reports to the CFTC concerning compliance with the terms of the CFTC Order: Use best efforts to encourage the development of rigorous standards for benchmark interest rates: and Continue to cooperate with the CFTCs ongoing investigation of benchmark interest rates.
As part of the NPA, Barclays agreed to pay a $160m penalty.
In addition, the DOJ agreed not to prosecute Barclays for any crimes except for criminal tax violations, as to which the DOJ cannot and does not make any agreement related to Barclays submissions of benchmark interest rates, including LIBOR and EURIBOR, contingent upon Barclays satisfaction of specified obligations under the NPA.
In particular, under the NPA, Barclays agreed for a period of two years from 26 June 2012, amongst other things, to: Commit no United States crime whatsoever: Truthfully and completely disclose non-privileged information with respect to the activities of Barclays, its officers and employees, and others concerning all matters about which the DOJ inquires of it, which information can be used for any purpose, except as otherwise limited in the NPA: Bring to the DOJs attention all potentially criminal conduct by Barclays or any of its employees that relates to fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets: and Bring to the DOJs attention all criminal or regulatory investigations, administrative proceedings or civil actions brought by any governmental authority in the United States by or against Barclays or its employees that alleges fraud or violations of the laws governing securities and commodities markets.
Barclays also agreed to cooperate with the DOJ and other government authorities in the United States in connection with any investigation or prosecution arising out of the conduct described in the NPA, which commitment shall remain in force until all such investigations and prosecutions are concluded.
Barclays also continues to cooperate with the other ongoing investigations.
It is not practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of these matters or what effect, if any, that the matters might have upon operating results, cash flows or Barclays financial position in any particular period.

FERC Investigation The United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the FERC Office of Enforcement investigated Barclays power trading in the western US with respect to the period from late 2006 through 2008.
On 31 October 2012, the FERC issued a public Order to Show Cause and Notice of Proposed Penalties Order and Notice against Barclays Bank PLC in relation to this matter.
In the Order and Notice the FERC asserts that Barclays Bank PLC violated the FERCs Anti-Manipulation Rule by manipulating the electricity markets in and around California from November 2006 to December 2008.
The FERC is proposing that Barclays Bank PLC pay a $435m civil penalty and disgorge an additional $34.9m of profits plus interest.
Barclays intends to defend this matter vigorously.
Other Regulatory Investigations The FSA and the Serious Fraud Office are both investigating certain commercial agreements between Barclays and Qatari interests and whether these may have related to Barclays capital raisings in June and November 2008.
The FSA investigation involves four current and former senior employees including Chris Lucas, Group Finance Director, as well as Barclays.
The FSA enforcement investigation began in July 2012 and the Serious Fraud Office commenced its investigation in August 2012.
In October 2012 Barclays was informed by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission that they had commenced an investigation into whether the Groups relationships with third parties who assist Barclays to win or retain business are compliant with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
Barclays is co-operating with all the authorities fully.
It is not possible to estimate the financial impact upon Barclays should any adverse findings be made.

Currency translation movements in 2012 of 1,578m 2011: 1,607m, including 259m 2011: 598m associated with non-controlling interests, are largely due to the depreciation of the US Dollar and Rand against Sterling.
The impact of the currency translation reserve recognised in the income statement during the year was 24m 2011: nil.
Available for sale reserve The available for sale reserve represents the unrealised change in the fair value of available for sale investments since initial recognition.
The available for sale reserve increased by 546m 2011: 1,374m, largely driven by 1,193m gains from changes in fair value excluding non-controlling interests, 474m losses transferred to the income statement due to fair value hedging, offset by 703m gains transferred to the income statement, including the disposal of BlackRock, Inc. and a 352m decrease due to the impact of current and deferred tax movements.
Cash flow hedging reserve The cash flow hedging reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash flow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged transactions affect profit or loss.
The increase in the cash flow hedging reserve of 662m 2011: 1,263m increase principally reflected 1,535m increases in the fair value of interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes partially offset by 695m gains transferred to net profit.
Other reserves and treasury shares Other reserves represent the excess of the repurchase price over the nominal of redeemed ordinary and preference shares issues by the Group.
Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders equity within other reserves and treasury shares.
A transfer is made to retained earnings in line with the vesting of treasury shares held for the purposes of share based payments.
The treasury shares primarily relate to Barclays PLC shares held in relation to the Groups various share schemes.
These schemes are described in Note 36.
During the period 979m 2011: 165m net purchases of treasury shares were made principally reflecting the increase in shares held for the purposes of employee share schemes, and 946m 2011: 499m was transferred to retained earnings reflecting the vesting of deferred share based payments.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 291 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued Employee benefits The notes included in this section focus on the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.
35 Staff costs Accounting for staff cost The Group applies IAS 19 Employee benefits in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.
Short term employee benefits salaries, and accrued performance costs, social security and the Bank Payroll Tax are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate.
Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the services.
Deferred cash bonus awards and deferred share bonus awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the vesting period.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period, typically three years from the grant date.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share bonus awards is recognised is based upon the common understanding between the employee and the Group and the terms and conditions of the award.
The Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest as this is the period over which the employees understand that they must provide service in order to receive awards.
The table on page 82 details the relevant award dates, payment dates and the period in which the income statement charge arises for bonuses.
No expense has been recognised in 2012 for the deferred bonuses granted in March 2013, as they are dependent upon future performance rather than performance during 2012.
The accounting policies for share based payments and pensions and other post-retirement benefits are under Note 36 and Note 37 respectively.
2012 2011 2010 m m m Performance costs 2,425 2,527 3,350 Salaries 5,981 6,277 6,151 Other share based payments 105 167 168 Social security costs 685 716 719 Post-retirement benefits 590 727 528 Total compensation costs 9,786 10,414 10,916 Bank payroll tax 34 76 96 Other 627 917 904 Non compensation costs 661 993 1,000 Staff costs 10,447 11,407 11,916 2012 Total staff costs reduced 8% to 10,447m, principally reflecting a 5% reduction in salaries, a 19% reduction in post-retirement benefits and reductions in performance costs.
Salaries reduced by 5% to 5,981m reflecting a moderately declining average headcount.
The post-retirement benefits charge decreased 19% to 590m, primarily reflecting scheme closures and benefit changes in the US and Spain, and lower interest cost for the UK Retirement Fund.
The post-retirement benefits charge includes 311m 2011: 318m: 2010: 297m in respect of defined contribution schemes and 279m 2011: 409m: 2010: 231m in respect of defined benefit schemes.
Performance costs reduced 4% to 2,425m, reflecting a 22% reduction in charges for current year cash and share bonuses and sales commissions, commitments and other incentives of 1,202m, partially offset by a 23% increase in the charge for deferred bonuses from prior years to 1,223m.
The Group incentive awards granted which exclude charges relating to prior year deferrals but include current year awards vesting in future years were down 16% to 2.2bn.
Investment Bank incentive awards were down 20% to 1.4bn.

com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 35 Staff costs continued The UK Government applied a bank payroll tax of 50% to all discretionary bonuses over 25,000 awarded to UK bank employees between 9 December 2009 and 5 April 2010.
The total bank payroll tax paid was 437m, of which 397m was recognised between 2009 and 2011.
For 2012, a charge of 34m has been recognised in relation to prior year deferrals, with the remaining 6m to be recognised in 2013.
The average total number of persons employed by the Group including both continuing and discontinued operations was 143,700 2011: 149,700.
2011 Staff costs decreased 4% to 11,407m, largely due to a 25% reduction in performance costs partially offset by the non-recurrence of a 304m credit in 2010 relating to post-retirement benefits.
Charges relating to prior year deferrals were 1bn.
The Group incentive awards granted which exclude charges relating to prior year deferrals but include current year awards vesting in future years were down 26% to 2.6bn.
Investment Bank incentive awards were down 35% to 1.7bn.
Salaries increased 2% to 6,277m against a moderately declining average headcount.
During 2011, staff numbers decreased 4% primarily due to restructuring activities across the businesses.
36 Share based payments Accounting for share based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services, generally the period in which the award is granted or notified and the vesting date of the shares or options.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reflect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reflected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions, such as continuing to make payments into a share based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2012 2011 2010 m m m Share Value Plan 610 634 361 Executive Share Award Scheme 115 101 304 Others 58 137 172 Total equity settled 783 872 837 Cash settled 35 34 23 Total share based payments 818 906 860 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share Value Plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays PLC shares or provisional allocations of Barclays PLC shares which vest or are considered for release over a period of three years in equal annual tranches.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on release of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under schedule 1 to the SVP.
From 2010, the portion of a business unit LTIP award that was previously granted under ESAS is normally granted under SVP.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 293 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 36 Share based payments continued Executive Share Award Scheme ESAS ESAS awards were granted to participants in the form of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares.
The total value of the ESAS award made to the employee was dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual employee performance.
The ESAS award must normally be held for at least three years.
Additional bonus shares are subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and are considered for release upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award.
ESAS awards were also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under JSAP Joiners Share Award Plan.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the individual resigns and commences work with a competitor business.
Other schemes In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by and settled in the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which are individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Included within other schemes are the Performance Share Plan, Incentive Share Plan, Sharesave, Sharepurchase, and the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan which was introduced and approved at the AGM in April 2011.

com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 295 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 37 Pensions and post-retirement benefits Accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes including defined contribution and defined benefit as well as post-employment benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Defined benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligation to members of the scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets and unrecognised actuarial gains or losses.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method on the assumptions set out in the note below.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
The Group uses the option within IAS 19 Employee Benefits to defer actuarial gains and losses over the remaining service lives of the employees.
Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses, to the extent that they exceed the greater of: 10% of the fair value of the scheme assets or 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation, are deferred and the excess amortised in the income statement over the average service lives of scheme members.
Gains and losses on curtailments are recognised when the curtailment occurs, which may be when a demonstrable commitment to a reduction in benefits, or reduction in eligible employees, occurs.
The gain or loss comprises any change in the present value of the obligation, the fair value of the assets and any related unrecognised actuarial gain or loss and past service costs.
Where a schemes assets and its unrecognised actuarial losses exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions.
Post-employment benefits the cost of providing health care benefits to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension schemes.
Future accounting development From 1 January 2013, the Group will adopt IAS 19 revised.
Had the Group adopted the revisions in these financial statements the net recognised position would reduce by 3.3bn 2011: 1.7bn resulting in a liability of 1.3bn 2011: 0.2bn.
Profit after tax for the period ended 31 December 2012 would have been lower by 22m 2011: 83m and other comprehensive income lower by 2.4bn 2011: 1.2bn.
Shareholders equity would have been reduced by 2.5bn 2011: 1.3bn and additional deferred tax assets of 0.8bn 2011: 0.5bn would have been recognised.
Pension schemes From 1 October 2012 a new UK pension scheme, the Barclays Pension Savings Plan BPSP was established to satisfy Auto Enrolment legislation.
The BPSP is a defined contribution scheme providing benefits for all new UK employees, and all existing Investment Bank employees, along with all UK employees who were not members of a pension scheme as at 1 October 2012.
The UK Retirement Fund UKRF is the Groups main defined benefit scheme, representing approximately 93% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
The UKRF was closed to new entrants as at 1 October 2012, and comprises ten sections, the most significant of which are: Afterwork: comprising of a voluntary defined contribution element and a contributory cash balance defined benefit.
The cash balance element is revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI maximum 5%.
An investment-related increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Between 1 October 2003 and 1 October 2012 the majority of new UK employees outside of the Investment Bank were eligible to join this section: The Pension Investment Plan PIP : a defined contribution section providing benefits for Investment Bank employees from 1 July 2001 to 1 October 2012.
This section was closed as at 1 October 2012 for existing and new Investment Bank employees.
All PIP members now accrue benefits in the BPSP mentioned above: and The 1964 Pension Scheme: most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benefits in this non-contributory defined benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010 members became eligible to accrue future service benefits in either Afterwork or PIP.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benefits are borne by the UKRF for Afterwork members, and through insured policies for BPSP members.

The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company incorporated on 20 December 1990 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays or the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
Similar principles of pension governance apply to the Groups other pension schemes, although different legislation covers overseas schemes where, in most cases, the Group has the power to determine the funding rate.

As at 31 December 2012, the UKRFs IAS 19 scheme assets were in deficit versus obligations by 800m 2011: surplus of 277m.
The most significant driver for this change was the fall in real corporate bond yields relative to inflation.
This was partially offset by the deficit contribution of 500m paid in April 2012. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 297 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 37 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions, below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for UKRF.
Discount rate 4.31 4.74 Inflation rate 2.93 3.04 Rate of increase in salaries 3.43 3.54 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.88 2.94 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 2.88 2.94 Afterwork revaluation rate 3.40 3.47 Expected return on scheme assets n a 5.00 The UKRF discount rate assumption is based on a liability-weighted rate, derived from an AA corporate bond yield curve.
For 2012 the basis for deriving the discount rate assumption was revised.
From December 2012, the rate is taken as the average of a liability-weighted rate derived from an AA corporate bond yield curve and the Towers Watson RATE link model.
The impact of this change on the UKRF Defined Benefit Obligation was a 1.1bn decrease with no impact on the current year profit.
The change will affect future years profits and on an IAS 19 Revised basis, the change in estimate will result in a 50m reduced charge to the income statement, compared to if the Group had continued using last years AA corporate bond yield curve.
It is not possible to estimate the effect on profits after 2013.
The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2012 of Barclays own post-retirement mortality experience, which was carried out at the time of the latest triennial funding valuation, and taking account of recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future improvements in this observed rate of mortality based on the CMI 2010 Core Projection model with a 1% p. a. long term trend.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the last three years: Assumed life expectancy 2012 2011 2010 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 27.8 27.7 27.6 Females 28.9 28.8 28.7 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 29.2 29.1 29.7 Females 30.5 30.4 30.7 Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The following table shows a sensitivity analysis of the most material assumptions on the UKRF benefit obligation: Change in key assumptions Impact on UKRF benefit obligation Decrease Decrease Increase Increase % bn 0.5 % increase in discount rate 9.1 2.2 0.5% increase in assumed price inflation 8.4 2.0 1 year increase to life expectancy at 60 2.5 0.6 298 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 37 Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued Assets A long term investment strategy has been set for the UKRF, with its asset allocation comprising a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long term investment strategy ensures, amongst other aims, that investments are adequately diversified.
Asset managers are permitted some flexibility to vary the asset allocation from the long term investment strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.

The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by the Barclays Group.
The UKRF scheme assets also includes 240m relating to UK private equity investments 2011: 50m and 1,174m relating to overseas private equity investments 2011: 1,342m.
These are disclosed above within Equities.
The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on weighted average estimated returns for each asset class.
Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as inflation, credit spreads and equity risk premiums.
The Group actual return on scheme assets was an increase of 1,385m 2011: 2,595m increase, of which 1,249m 2011: 2,564m relates to UKRF.
The overall expected return on asset assumption has been based on the portfolio of assets created after allowing for the net impact of the derivatives on the risk and return profile of the holdings.
As at 31 December 2012, the expected rate of return is not applicable due to the removal of the expected return on scheme assets under IAS 19 Revised, effective from 1 January 2013.
Approximately a third of the UK Retirement Fund assets are invested in liability driven investment strategies: primarily UK gilts as well as interest rate and inflation swaps.
These are used to better match the funds assets to its liabilities.
The swaps are used to reduce the schemes inflation and duration risks against its liabilities.

In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, the Bank and Trustee agreed a scheme-specific funding target, statement of funding principles, a schedule of contributions and a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit in the Fund.
The recovery plan to eliminate the deficit will result in the Bank paying deficit contributions to the Fund until 2021.
Deficit contributions of 1.8bn were paid to the fund in December 2011 and a further 0.5bn paid in April 2012.
Further deficit contributions are payable from 2017 to 2021 starting at 0.65bn in 2017 and increasing by approximately 3.5% per annum until 2021.
These deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Groups share of the cost of benefits accruing over each year.
Including deficit contributions, the Groups estimated contribution to the UKRF in 2013 will be 175m.
Excluding the UKRF, the Group is expected to pay contributions of approximately 133m to UK schemes and 60m to overseas schemes in 2013.
The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 30 September.

Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint Ventures are entities whose activities are governed by a contractual arrangement between the Group and one or more parties to share equally in decisions regarding operating and financial policies.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Groups share of the post-acquisition profit or loss.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.

These are included in Note 28.
40 Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash flows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
In the course of its normal banking activities, the Group makes transfers of financial assets, either legally where legal rights to the cash flows from the asset are passed to the counterparty or beneficial where the Group retains the rights to the cash flows but assumes a responsibility to transfer them to the counterparty.
Depending on the nature of the transaction, this may result in derecognition of the assets in their entirety, partial derecognition or no derecognition of the assets subject to the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
When an asset is transferred, in some circumstances, the Group may retain an interest in it continuing involvement requiring the Group to repurchase it in certain circumstances for other than its fair value on that date.
302 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 40 Securitisations continued A summary of the main transactions, and the assets and liabilities and the financial risks arising from these transactions, is set out below: Transfers of financial assets that do not result in derecognition Securitisations The Group was party to securitisation transactions involving its residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card balances.
In addition, the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other lending institutions for securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash flows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, which then issues interest bearing debt securities to third-party investors.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction.
Partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets can also occur or derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets that have not resulted in full derecognition, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2012 2011 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Carrying Carrying Carrying amount Fair Value amount Fair Value amount Fair Value m m m m m m Loans and advances to customers Residential mortgage loans 5,545 5,129 5,066 4,600 7,946 8,085 Credit cards, unsecured and other retail lending 6,944 7,015 5,519 5,542 4,059 3,477 Corporate loans 944 798 809 679 1,391 1,428 Total 13,433 12,942 11,394 10,821 13,396 12,990 Assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Retained interest in residential mortgage loans 12 n a n a 1 Balances included within loans and advance to customers represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.
The relationship between the transferred assets and the associated liabilities is that holders of notes may only look to cash flows from the securitised assets for payments of principal and interest due to them under the terms of their notes, although the contractual terms of their notes may be different to the maturity and interest of the transferred assets.
Retained interests in residential mortgage loans are securities which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk in the underlying securitised assets.
The carrying amount of the loans before transfer was 16m 2011: 2,299m.
The retained interest is initially recorded as an allocation of the original carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained.
For transfers of assets in relation to repurchase agreements, see Notes 22 and 42. barclays.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 303 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 40 Securitisations continued Continuing involvement in financial assets that have been derecognised In some cases, the Group may have transferred a financial asset in its entirety but may have continuing involvement in it.
This arises in asset securitisations where loans and asset backed securities were derecognised as a result of the Groups involvement with CLOs, CDOs, RMBS and CMBS.
Continuing involvement largely arises from providing financing into these structures in the form of retained notes, which do not bear first losses.
The table below shows the potential financial implications of such continuing involvement: Continuing involvement as at Gain loss from 31 December 2012 continuing involvement For the Cumulative Maximum year ended to Carrying exposure 31 December 31 December amount Fair value to loss 2012 2012 Type of transfer m m m m m CLO and other assets 2,546 2,495 2,556 126 839 ABS CDO Super Senior 1,387 922 1,387 230 1,708 US sub-prime and Alt-A 781 781 781 8 1,336 Commercial mortgage backed securities 239 239 239 1 41 Total 4,953 4,437 4,963 95 3,924 Assets which represent the Groups continuing involvement in derecognised assets are recorded in the following line items: Trading Available Loans and portfolio for sale advances assets Derivatives investments Total Type of transfer m m m m m CLO and other assets 1,624 899 7 16 2,546 ABS CDO Super Senior 1,387 1,387 US sub-prime and Alt-A 703 78 781 Commercial mortgage backed securities 239 239 Total 3,714 1,216 7 16 4,953 41 Off-balance sheet arrangements In the ordinary course of business and primarily to facilitate client transactions, the Group enters into transactions which may involve the use of off-balance sheet arrangements and special purpose entities SPEs.
These arrangements include the provision of guarantees, loan commitments, retained interests in assets which have been transferred to an unconsolidated SPE or obligations arising from the Groups involvements with such SPEs.
Guarantees The Group issues guarantees on behalf of its customers.
In the majority of cases, the Group will hold collateral against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both.
In addition, the Group issues guarantees on its own behalf.
The main types of guarantees provided are: financial guarantees given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans: overdrafts: and other banking facilities, including stock borrowing indemnities and standby letters of credit.
Other guarantees provided include performance guarantees, advance payment guarantees, tender guarantees, guarantees to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and retention guarantees.
The nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities with off-balance sheet risk is set out in Note 28.
Loan commitments The Group enters into commitments to lend to its customers subject to certain conditions.
Such loan commitments are made either for a fixed period or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions.
Information on loan commitments and similar facilities is set out in Note 28.
Leasing The Group leases various offices, branches, other premises and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
Information on leasing can be found in Note 25.
Special Purpose Entities SPEs SPEs are entities that are created to accomplish a narrow and well defined objective.
There are often specific restrictions or limits around their ongoing activities.
The Groups transactions with SPEs take a number of forms, including: the provision of financing to fund asset purchases, or commitments to provide finance for future purchases: derivative transactions to provide investors in the SPE with a specified exposure: the provision of liquidity or backstop facilities which may be drawn upon if the SPE experiences future funding difficulties: and direct investment in the notes issued by SPEs.
304 I Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 barclays.
com annualreport The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information 41 Off-balance sheet arrangements continued A number of the Groups transactions have recourse only to the assets of unconsolidated SPEs.
Typically, the majority of the exposure to these assets is borne by third parties and the Groups risk is mitigated through , unwind features and other protective measures.
The business activities within the Group where SPEs are used include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, client intermediation, credit structuring, asset realisations and fund management.
These activities are described below.
In addition, later sections provide quantitative information on the Groups involvements with CDOs, SIVs, SIV-Lites and conduits.
Multi-seller conduit programmes Barclays creates, administers and provides liquidity and credit enhancements to several commercial paper conduit programmes, primarily in the United States.
These conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell consumer or trade receivables to the conduit, which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase.
The conduits have sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and liquidity support to maintain an investment grade rating for the commercial paper.
Asset securitisations The Group has assisted its customers with the formation of asset securitisations, some of which are effected through the use of SPEs.
These entities have minimal equity and rely on funding in the form of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation.
As these SPEs are created for other companies, the Group does not usually control these entities and therefore does not consolidate them.
The Group may provide financing in the form of senior notes or junior notes and may also provide derivatives to the SPE.
These transactions are included on the balance sheet.
The Group has also used SPEs to securitise part of its originated and purchased retail and commercial lending portfolios and credit card receivables.
These SPEs are usually consolidated and derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers its contractual right to receive cash flows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
The carrying amount of securitised assets together with the associated liabilities are set out in Note 40.
Client intermediation The Group has structured transactions as a financial intermediary to meet investor and client needs.
These transactions involve entities structured by either the Group or the client and are used to modify cash flows of third party assets to create investments with specific risk or return profiles or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks.
Such transactions will typically result in a derivative being shown on the balance sheet, representing the Groups exposure to the relevant asset.
The Group also invests in lessor entities specifically to acquire assets for leasing.
Client intermediation also includes arrangements to fund the purchase or construction of specific assets most common in the property industry.
Credit structuring The Group structures investments to provide specific risk profiles to investors.
This may involve the sale of credit exposures, often by way of derivatives, to an entity which subsequently funds those exposures by issuing securities.
These securities may initially be held by Barclays prior to sale outside of the Group.
Asset realisations The Group establishes SPEs to facilitate the recovery of loans in circumstances where the borrower has suffered financial loss.
To the extent that there are guarantees and commitments in relation to SPEs the details are included in Note 28.
Collateralised debt obligations CDOs The Group has structured and underwritten CDOs.
At inception, the Groups exposure principally takes the form of a liquidity facility provided to support future funding difficulties or cash shortfalls in the vehicles.
If required by the vehicle, the facility is drawn with the amount advanced included within loans and advances on the balance sheet.
Upon an event of default or other triggering event, the Group may acquire control of a CDO and, therefore, be required to fully consolidate the vehicle for accounting purposes.
The potential for transactions to hit default triggers before the end of 2012 has been assessed and is included in the determination of an impairment charge of 232m 2011: 6m in relation to ABS CDO Super Senior and other credit market exposures for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The Groups exposure to ABS CDO Super Senior positions before hedging was 1,387m as at 31 December 2012 2011: 1,842m, equivalent to an aggregate 60.30% 2011: 51.68% decline in value on average for all investors.
This represents the Groups exposure to High Grade CDOs, stated net of write downs and charges.
These facilities are fully drawn and included within loans and advances on the balance sheet.
Collateral The collateral underlying unconsolidated CDOs comprised 78% 2011: 78% residential mortgage backed securities, 2% 2011: 2% nonresidential asset backed securities and 20% 2011: 20% in other categories a proportion of which will be backed by residential mortgage collateral.
The remaining Weighted Average Life WAL of all collateral is 6.16 years 2011: 7.41 years.
The combined Net Asset Value NAV for all of the collateral underlying the CDOs was 1bn 2011: 1bn.
com annualreport Barclays PLC Annual Report 2012 I 305 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 41 Off-balance sheet arrangements continued Funding The CDOs were funded with senior unrated notes and rated notes up to AAA.
The capital structure senior to the AAA notes on cash CDOs was supported by a liquidity facility provided by the Group.
The senior portion covered by liquidity facilities is on average 85% 2011: 82% of the capital structure.
The initial WAL of the notes in issue averaged 6.7 years 2011: 6.7 years.
The full contractual maturity is 38.2 years 2011: 38.2 years.
Interests in third party CDOs The Group has purchased securities in and entered into derivative instruments with third party CDOs.
These interests are held as trading assets or liabilities on the Groups balance sheet and measured at fair value.
The Group has not provided liquidity facilities or similar agreements to third party CDOs.
Structured investment vehicles SIVs The Group does not structure or manage SIVs.
Group exposure to third party SIVs comprised: nil 2011: nil of senior liquidity facilities and derivative exposures included on the balance sheet at their net fair value of nil 2011: 6m.
SIV-Lites The Group does not have any exposure to SIV-Lite transactions nor is it involved in the ongoing management thereof.
Commercial paper and medium term note conduits The Group provided 7bn 2011: 14bn in undrawn backstop liquidity facilities to its own sponsored CP conduits.
The Group fully consolidates these entities such that the underlying assets are reflected on the Group balance sheet.
These consolidated entities in turn provide facilities of 661m 2011: 717m to third party conduits containing prime UK buy-to-let Residential Mortgage Backed Securities RMBS assets.
As at 31 December 2012, the entire facility had been drawn and is included in available for sale financial investments.
The Group provided backstop facilities to support the paper issued by one third party conduit.
This facility totalled 247m 2011: 259m, with underlying collateral comprising 100% auto loans.
There were no drawings on this facility as at 31 December 2012.
The Group provided backstop facilities to five third party SPEs that fund themselves with medium term notes.
These notes are sold to investors as a series of 12-month securities and remarketed to investors annually.
If investors decline to renew their holdings at a price below a pre-agreed spread, the backstop facility requires the Group to purchase the outstanding notes at scheduled maturity.
The Group has provided facilities of 0.5bn 2011: 0.9bn to SPEs holding prime UK and Australian owner-occupied RMBS assets.
As at the balance sheet date these facilities had been drawn and were included in loans and advances.
42 Assets pledged Assets are pledged as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives.
The following table summarises the nature and carrying amount of the assets pledged as security against these liabilities: 2012 2011 m m Trading portfolio assets 85,026 86,677 Loans and advances 72,918 40,613 Other 20,789 19,976 Assets pledged 178,733 147,266 Barclays has an additional 15bn 2011: 16bn of loans and advances within its asset backed funding programmes that can readily be used to raise additional secured funding and available to support future issuance.
Collateral held as security for assets Under certain transactions, including reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing transactions, the Group is allowed to resell or re-pledge the collateral held.
The fair value at the balance sheet date of collateral accepted and re-pledged to others was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fair value of securities accepted as collateral 360,061 391,287 Of which fair value of securities re-pledged transferred to others 307,950 341,060 The full disclosure as per IFRS7 has been included in collateral and other credit enhancements page 116.
