Loans to fund products Loans to fund products are short-term advances primarily to Man structured products.
The loans are repayable on demand and are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The average balance during the period was $332 million nine months to 31 December 2011: $449million.
Loans to fund products have decreased compared to the prior period as the structured product FUM has decreased together with the associated leverage.
The liquidity requirements of the structured products together with commitments to provide financial support Note 28, which give rise to loans to funds, are subject to our routine liquidity stress testing and any liquidity requirements are met by available cash resources, or the committed syndicated revolving loan facility.
Loans to fund products expose Man to credit risk and therefore the credit decision making process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The carrying value represents Mans maximum exposure to credit risk.
Loans are closely monitored against the assets held in the funds.
The largest single loan to a fund product was $21 million 31 December 2011: $18 million.
Fund entities are not externally rated, but our internal modelling indicates that fund products have a probability of default that is equivalent to a credit rating of AA or better.
Other investments in fund products Man uses capital to invest in our fund products as part of our on-going business to build our product breadth and to trial investment research developments before we market the products to investors.
These investments are generally held for less than one year.
Other investments in fund products are classified primarily at fair value through profit or loss.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date.
Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported net asset values NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the timings of being able to redeem the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSPs based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSPs are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to NAVs where the timing of being able to redeem the fund product or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets is disclosed in Note 26.
