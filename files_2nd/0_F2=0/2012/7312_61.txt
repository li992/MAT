HERITAGE OIL PLC Financial Statements 2012 28 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 7 ACQUISITION OF AN INTEREST IN OML 30 CONTINUED The fair value allocation of the Acquisition Assets is based upon an independent review.
The Company used the data from the independent review to calculate the fair value of the assets taking proved and probable reserves.
In accordance with IAS 12, a deferred tax liability has been recognised for the difference between the fair value allocated to property, plant and equipment and the value of the consideration that can be claimed as a capital allowance to offset the future tax liability, calculated on a tax rate of 65.75% for the first five years and rising to 85% after five years.
As only a portion of the purchase consideration is available to be claimed as a capital allowance and the tax rates are high, this has resulted in the recognition of a significant deferred tax liability.
As a result of the impact of the deferred tax liability recognised, the purchase consideration is higher than the aggregate of the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities and therefore goodwill has been recognised.
The fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities is provisional and if new information is obtained within one year of the acquisition date the acquisition accounting may be revised..
