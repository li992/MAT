Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2012 10.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill acquired has arisen on the acquisition of a number of businesses and has an indeterminable useful life.
Therefore it is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs, which are currently the statutory entities acquired.
This is the lowest level in the Group at which goodwill is monitored for impairment and is at a lower level than the Groups operating segments.
In the table below, only the goodwill relating to the acquisition of R&R Sales LLC is expected to be subject to tax relief.
The analysis of acquired goodwill on consolidation is: 2012 2011 000 000 itp GmbH 2,886 3,120 Renishaw Diagnostics Limited 92.4% 1,784 1,784 Renishaw Mayeld S. A.
75% 1,559 1,674 Measurement Devices Limited 66% 6,661 5,713 Renishaw Software Limited 1,559 R&R Sales LLC 4,275 Other smaller acquisitions 492 403 Total acquired goodwill 19,216 12,694 The recoverable amounts of acquired goodwill are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections with assumptions as follows: itp GmbH part of the metrology reportable segment actual operating results and an average growth rate of 5% for 5 years with anil growth rate to perpetuity 2011 same basis.
Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, Renishaw Mayeld S. A. both in the healthcare reportable segment, Measurement Devices Limited and R&R Sales LLC both in the metrology reportable segment five-year business plans with a nil growth rate to perpetuity 2011samebasis where applicable.
These are considered prudent estimates based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
The growth rates used in the business plans vary from 13% to 26%, except for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited, which is in its research and development phase and thus has negligible revenue to date.
A pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been used in discounting the projected cash ows of itp GmbH, Measurement Devices Limited and R&R Sales LLC 2011 12% where applicable.
A pre-tax discount rate of 15% has been used for Renishaw Diagnostics Limited and Renishaw Mayeld S. A.
These have been set on the basis of them being appropriate rates for a market participant.
On this basis, no impairment write-downs are required.
There is significant headroom in all the above and for an impairment to arise, there would need to be a significant material deterioration in business: this is considered to be remote.
An increase in 5% in the discount rate would not result in an impairment.
For goodwill to be impaired in the CGU with the minimum headroom, the discount rate would have to increase to 21.5%.
