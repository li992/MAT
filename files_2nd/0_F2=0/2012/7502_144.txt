FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED CLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS In addition to the other financial assets and liabilities set out above in Principal financial instruments, the Group also has financial assets and liabilities disclosed in notes 20 and 23.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups longterm debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before discounting.
The actual payment profile of Other creditors is principally dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

The principal is included in the previous table when the facility is due to expire.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change of 10% increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
2012 2011 Increase in interest rate 10% 10% Reduction in profit before tax m 0.2 0.1 CREDIT RISK The Group trades only with creditworthy third parties.
It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
LIQUIDITY RISK Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 21 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration and the bank overdrafts and the revolving credit facilities, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
