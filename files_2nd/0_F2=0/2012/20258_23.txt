The Budget on 23 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce further to 22% by 2014.
The effective tax charge borne by the Group's UK subsidiaries will reduce accordingly in future years.
All UK deferred tax assets and liabilities that will unwind after 1 April 2013 have been recognised at the rate of 23%, being the rate substantively enacted by the UK Parliament, effective from that date.
Factors affecting future tax charge The Group's overseas profits are subject to overseas tax rates some of which are lower than the standard rate of UK corporation tax.
All other deferred tax assets and liabilities at 30 September 2012 have also been calculated based on the rate which will be substantively enacted that is expected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
Future changes in tax rates will also impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.

84 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 11 Earnings per share The calculations of earnings per share are based on the following profits and numbers of shares.
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the potentially dilutive shares into ordinary shares.
Underlying earnings per share figures are calculated by adjusting the profit to exclude amortisation and impairment of intangible assets.
The purpose of providing the underlying earnings per share is to allow readers of the accounts to clearly consider trends without the impact of these non-cash items.

com 87 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 12 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles Goodwill and intangibles The Group has one cash generating unit CGU for the purpose of assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets reflecting the fact that the Group is managed as a single asset management business.
It previously had two CGUs: i property asset management and ii investment management.
However, management of the property asset class was fully integrated with the other asset classes, such that cashflows can no longer be identified independently.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets are as follows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Investment management 906.8 64.8 Property asset management 153.2 Combined investment management 994.1 1,060.0 60.1 64.8 The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined by value-in-use calculations which use five year cash flow projections based on the Group's approved budget for the year to 30 September 2013 and which take into account the market conditions prevailing at the time.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows within the value-in-use calculations for later years.
The long-term growth rate assumption of 2% is in line with the long-term nature of the Group's business and in line with the Board's view that the Group will operate as a going concern in the long-term.
The principal assumptions are: 2012 2011 % % Annual increase in assets under management 6.0 6.0 Annual increase in operating costs 5.5 5.0 - 5.5 The assumed annual increases in operating costs include provision for inflation of salaries and other operating costs, as well as provision for the additional costs associated with the assumed increased levels of business.
There are no changes to assumed management fee margins.
The following discount rates have been used in the impairment analysis.
They are based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital using a risk free interest rate, together with a beta for the sector and allied to an equity risk premium.
2012 2012 2011 2011 Post tax Pre tax Post tax Pre tax % % % % Investment management 9.6 11.5 Property asset management 11.1 13.8 Combined investment management 9.5 11.2 The impairment review included a sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions underpinning the cash flow projections and the rate at which the projections were discounted to arrive at the final value-in-use.
The sensitivity analysis included testing assumptions relating to future revenue growth and the assumptions surrounding the level of operating costs and margins.
88 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values-in-use to the carrying values of goodwill were: 2012 Combined 2011 2011 investment Investment Property asset management management management m m m Discount rate pre tax 27.6 24.3 16.9 Long-term growth rate 98.8 49.3 8.4 Inflation rate 25.2 26.4 8.7 The value-in-use, calculated in accordance with the process described above, was compared with the carrying values of goodwill, intangible assets and property plant and equipment.
The comparison resulted in a surplus of value-in-use over the carrying value of these assets as shown in the table below, and therefore no impairment of goodwill has been recognised in the year.
2012 Combined 2011 2011 investment Investment Property asset management management management m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 3,163.0 2,332.0 79.5 Management contracts and distribution agreements The Group reviewed the management contracts and distribution agreements held at 30 September 2012 including contracts which are considered to have an indefinite life.
Management contracts at 30 September 2012 include 79.3 million 2011: 99.3 million of assets which are considered to have an indefinite life.
These assets comprise contracts for the management of open end funds which have no limit of time or termination provisions.
The Group also reviewed definite life assets for impairment indicators and performed impairment tests where required.
Impairment tests were performed using the higher of value-in-use calculations using methods and assumptions described above in relation to goodwill and estimates of fair value less costs to sell.
Both measures of value were compared with the carrying value of the contracts.
An impairment charge of 10.0 million was recognised in the year to 30 September 2011 following the decision that DEGI International was to be placed into a controlled wind-down over a three year period.
The categories of management contracts and distribution agreements, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 30 September 2012 30 September 2011 Net Remaining Net Remaining book amortisation Estimated book amortisation Estimated values period useful life values period useful life m years years m years years Definite life management contracts 231.4 1-7 2-10 270.8 1-8 6-10 Definite life distribution contracts 21.1 2.3 5 30.2 3.3 5 Indefinite life open end fund contracts 79.3 N A Indefinite 99.3 N A Indefinite 331.8 400.3 Company impairment review A review of goodwill and management contracts held by the Company was carried out on the same basis as the Group review described above.
There were no indicators of impairment in respect of the management contracts held by the Company.
No impairment of goodwill or management contracts has been recognised in the year.
At 30 September 2012, the Company held indefinite life open end fund contracts with a value of 3.4 million 2011: 23.5 million.

The fair value of unlisted investments have been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and venture Capital valuation guidelines where relevant.
Interest bearing loans The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The valuations have considered similar issues available in the market and the liquidity of liabilities.
This excludes the unamortised issue costs of 1.2 million.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated cash flows are based on management's best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability component of the convertible bonds is determined using a 5.85% yield based on a similar instrument, assuming three years to maturity without conversion.
com 103 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 29 Fair value of financial Instruments continued Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are typically settled in a short time frame.
As a result, the fair value of these balances is considered to be materially equal to the carrying value, after taking into account potential impairment losses.
Financial instruments relating to unit linked contracts The Group's life assurance subsidiary provides unit linked wrappers which allow clients to benefit from investing in pooled funds.
As explained in note 18, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management as the financial risks and rewards attributable to theses assets also fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact of the level of the fees which are earned from this entity which are directly impacted by the underlying value of the policyholder assets.
While by necessity this subsidiary company has some insurance risks, these risks are completely reinsured, thereby negating any ultimate insurance risk to the Group's equity holders.
The assets above are all unit linked and held for the sole benefit of the policyholders within Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited.
Investment and credit risk in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit linked funds is borne by the policyholders.
Accordingly, these assets are not included in fair value measurements disclosure below.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Investments classified as level 3 principally comprise investments in property funds.
While the Group is not aware of significant differences between valuations received and reasonably possible alternatives, the value of these investments would be directly impacted by changes in the European and Asian property markets.
The Group estimates that a 10% increase decrease in the fair value of these investments will have a favourable unfavourable impact on equity of 3.6 million.
30 Financial risk management Overview This note describes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group's management of capital.
i Risk management The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market price risk foreign exchange risk interest rate risk The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and ongoing management of the Group's risk management framework and the implementation and operation of the Board's policies are handled by the Group's risk management committee.
The Group's risk committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board has approved the risk appetite statement, which sets out the quantum and types of risk that the Group is willing to accept in pursuing its objectives.
The risk appetite statement is a top-down framework against which policies, systems and limits can be set.
The Groups risk committee monitors compliance with the risk appetite statement through a series of key performance indicators.
The Group's audit committee is responsible for overseeing financial reports and internal control.
Internal audit assist the Group audit committee in its oversight role by undertaking both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures and report the results of these reviews directly to the audit committee.
The Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees are involved and understand their roles and obligations.
com 105 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Financial risk management continued ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay in full amounts when due, and arises principally from the Group's cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables and accrued income.
As detailed in note 29, the carrying value of financial instruments approximate their fair value, with the exception of interest bearing loans and borrowings.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of its financial assets.
A breakdown of the Group's relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.

The Group adopts a low risk strategy in respect of its treasury management, at all times ensuring, as far as possible, that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed in line with the Group's treasury policy as approved by the audit committee.
The treasury function manage the cash resources on a daily basis in accordance with the treasury policy.
We continuously monitor the credit ratings of all institutions where we deposit money.
Trade receivables and accrued income represent amounts recognised in revenue in the Group income statement which have not been settled by clients.
Outstanding balances are monitored locally by senior management and historically the level of default has not been significant and in the majority of cases there is an ongoing relationship with the client.

com 107 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Financial risk management continued Details of provisions against trade receivables at 30 September are as follows: Group 2012 2011 m m Trade receivables provision: Balance at 1 October 0.6 0.5 Bad debt release charge in the year 0.1 0.1 Balance at 30 September 0.5 0.6 This is a 100% provision held against gross trade receivable balances of 0.5 million at 30 September 2012 2011: 0.7 million.
Fees are billed to clients as soon as values are available and settlement is due within agreed contractual terms.
As a result, the average level for debtors and accrued income outstanding, at any point in time, will represent approximately 2.5 months' revenue.
At 30 September 2012 the Group had three 2011: six individual clients with greater than 1 million outstanding.
The total outstanding was 4.6 million 2011: 22.7 million.
The Group, in some situations, may be exposed to a concentration of credit risk, particularly from some of its larger clients or groups of connected clients.
This may arise during the period from recognition of management fees in the income statement and settlement of fees by clients.
very few clients have external credit ratings.
The Group operates and manages a number of open end funds and in doing so it seeks as far as possible to match the purchase and sale of investments in order to match the receipt or payment of funds from or to clients.
Where these positions are not matched the Group may be required to fund any shortfall although due to the short settlement period for these transactions the risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small.
In addition should any investor default on any payment due the Group would be entitled to recover any costs from the investor.
iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
The Group's approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The Group's facilities include 100 million of revolving credit facilities, which are undrawn.
The Group has cash balances of 347.9 million at 30 September 2012.
Therefore, the current headroom between available facilities and amounts drawn is substantial and the Groups intention will be to maintain the headroom at a healthy level in the future.

com 109 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Financial risk management continued iv Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
These financial instruments include the Groups investments in seed capital and is invested to support the launch of new funds.
Seed capital is typically invested in quoted funds for less than one year.
These investments have been measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Investments in property funds are usually for longer term eg five to seven years and are measured as available for sale.
These securities are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMB.
The objective of market price risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Board sets the limits for investing seed capital and regularly monitors the exposure.
The following financial assets are exposed to market risk: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial investments 11.5 10.4 11.5 Stock of units and shares 0.2 0.4 Seed capital 40.4 29.8 31.2 19.2 Available for sale financial assets Financial investments 37.2 46.8 5.6 11.1 89.3 87.4 48.3 30.3 The Group's defined benefit pension schemes hold assets which are exposed to market price risk.
Details of these assets are shown in note 32.
Sensitivity analysis is disclosed below.
v Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk at a transactional and translational level.
Transaction risk is the risk that the domestic value of a foreign currency denominated cash flow will vary adversely.
Translation risk arises from translating the balances of overseas subsidiaries which report their results in a currency other than sterling and therefore the sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Foreign currency transaction risk The Group undertakes transactions in a number of currencies and foreign currency risk arises through fluctuations in foreign currency changing the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments.
Revenues are earned principally from fees which are calculated on the basis of the value of AuM managed for clients and many mandates include investments valued in currencies other than sterling.
The fact that we operate on a global basis, with offices in a number of countries worldwide, means that a proportion of operating costs is also incurred in foreign currencies.
Further, coupons on the 7.9% perpetual capital securities are incurred in US dollars.
variations in the sterling value of these operating costs and interest cost will, to an extent, offset any similar impact of fluctuating exchange rates on revenues.
The Board has therefore decided that it is not appropriate to undertake any specific hedging of the Group's revenues or costs.

The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix.
The Groups debt consists of convertible debt and the revolving credit facilities, which were undrawn at 30 September 2012.
The convertible bonds, which were issued in December 2009, bear interest at a fixed rate throughout their five year life.
Interest on the revolving credit facilities, which have been undrawn throughout the year, is at LIBOR plus a margin.
The Group also receives variable rate interest on cash deposits.

The sensitivity analysis covers the financial instruments at each of the balance sheet dates and assumes changes in market variables.
It should however be noted that due to the inherent uncertainty in world financial markets the assumptions made may differ significantly from the actual outcome particularly as market risks tend to be interdependent and are therefore unlikely to move in isolation.
The following assumptions have been made in respect of the market risks: Sterling exchange rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% Market interest rates are assumed to increase or decrease by 1% Market prices are assumed to increase or decrease by 10% at each reporting date The impact of the assumptions on the financial assets and liabilities net of tax, are as follows: Group Impact on Impact on profit or profit or Impact on Impact on loss loss equity equity As at 30 September 2012 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 8.9 8.9 6.7 6.7 Sterling Euro 3.6 3.6 3.1 3.1 Sterling Nordic currencies 2.7 2.7 2.9 2.9 Sterling Singapore dollar 13.4 13.4 16.9 16.9 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 3.3 3.3 Financial investments available for sale 2.7 2.7 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.8 1.8 Impact on Impact on profit or profit or Impact on Impact on loss loss equity equity As at 30 September 2011 m m m m Exchange rate movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Currency Sterling US dollar 6.0 6.0 5.5 5.5 Sterling Euro 1.7 1.7 2.7 2.7 Sterling Nordic currencies 0.2 0.2 4.2 4.2 Market price movement 10% -10% 10% -10% Financial investments at fair value through profit or loss 3.2 3.2 Financial investments available for sale 3.0 3.0 Interest rate movement 1% -1% 1% -1% Sterling market interest rates 1.4 1.4 www.

The Board receives monthly updates on headroom over regulatory capital and supervises key decisions that may impact the future capital position of the Group.
Further information on the Groups regulatory capital position is given below.
The Groups capital structure consists of equity instruments, retained earnings and other equity reserves together with the perpetual capital securities.
The perpetual capital securities satisfy the requirements of financial reporting standards for treatment as equity and are treated as an element of capital for regulatory purposes.
Subsequent to the year-end, the capital position has been strengthened further by the conversion of 65.1 million of convertible bonds to ordinary shares.
This is discussed in note 33.
The Group uses cash generated from its operations to pay a progressive dividend.
The Board seeks to avoid further dilutive issuance of new shares and has, since 2010, satisfied vesting of deferred bonus awards by purchasing shares in the market through the Employee Benefit Trust.
116 Aberdeen Asset Management PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Regulatory capital requirements In accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD, as implemented in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA, the Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital.
In common with many other independent asset managers, the Group currently operates under the terms of a waiver from the requirement to meet the full consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
The waiver was granted by the FSA with effect from January 2007 and is effective until August 2014.
However, the Board expects to achieve its objective of eliminating reliance on this waiver by the end of 2012.
The Group is required to undertake an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, under which the Board quantifies the level of capital required to meet operational risks: this is referred to as the Pillar 2 capital requirement.
The objective of this process is to ensure that firms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks which may not be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 requirements.
This is a forward looking exercise which includes stress testing for the effects of major risks, such as those discussed on pages 31 to 33.
These tests consider how the Group would cope with a significant market downturn, for example, and include an assessment of the Group's ability to mitigate the risks.
At 30 September 2012 the Group had three subsidiaries which are registered in the United Kingdom and regulated by the FSA and a further 35 subsidiaries which are subject to regulation in a number of overseas jurisdictions.
With the exception of Aberdeen Asset Management Life and Pensions Limited, which is a regulated insurance firm, all others are regulated investment firms and are part of the Group consolidation for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
The overseas regulated companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements which are determined by the respective local regulators.
All the regulated companies in the Group maintained surpluses over their respective regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the target asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
