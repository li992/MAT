In the prior year two CGUs in the US Services business were amalgamated into one to reflect the way in which these businesses are managed and operated.
Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects and employee knowledge, expertise and security clearances.
The Group tests goodwill impairment for each CGU annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Key assumptions The value-in-use calculations use discounted future cash flows based on financial plans approved by the Board covering a two-year period.
Cash flows for periods beyond this period are extrapolated based on the second year of the two-year plan, with a terminal growth-rate assumption applied.
Terminal growth rates The specific plans for each of the CGUs have been extrapolated using a terminal growth rate of 2.0%-3.0% 2011: 2.0%-3.0%.
Growth rates are based on managements estimates which take into consideration the long-term nature of the industry in which the CGUs operate and external forecasts as to the likely growth of the industry in the longer term.
Discount rates The Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC was used as a basis in determining the discount rate to be applied adjusted for risks specific to the market characteristics of CGUs as appropriate on a pre-tax basis.
The pre-tax discount rates applied for the two UK Services CGUs were 10.5% and 10.6%, for the US Services CGU it was 9.7%, and for the Global Products CGUs were 9.5% and 9.7%.
Significant CGUs Sensitivity analysis shows that both the discount rate and growth rate assumptions are key variables that have an impact on the outcome of the recoverable amount.
Within UK Services the individual CGUs have significant headroom.
An increase in the WACC rate or a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for the UK Services CGUs as at 31 March was 27.4m and 2.8m respectively.
The US Services CGU has headroom, with current assumptions, of 84.4m.
If the discount rate assumption were increased by 1% the CGU would require an impairment of 28.8m.
Sensitivity analysis shows that a decrease or increase of 1% in the terminal growth rate could result in an impairment of 24.4m or headroom of 265.6m.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 370.7m.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the US has significant headroom.
An increase in either the WACC rate or a 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 112.8m.
The Technology Solutions CGU in the UK has headroom, under current assumptions, of 18.1m.
If the discount rate were to increase by 1%, or the terminal growth rate decrease by 1%, this would not cause the net operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount.
The carrying value of goodwill for this CGU as at 31 March was 5.6m.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions between 31 March 2012 and the signing of the financial statements that would cause the carrying value of the recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
