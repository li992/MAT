Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are debt and equity non-derivative financial assets and are initially recognised at fair value.
Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
For equity financial assets, where the fair value cannot be measured reliably, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any provision for non-recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or easily determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for fair value hedges is included in note 10.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our customers.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when all sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables note 16, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
If, during the course of trading such as a result of an error, any unmatched trades remain outstanding, the asset or liability is held within matched principal trade receivables or payables as appropriate and fair valued through the consolidated income statement until the trade is completed.
Deposits paid for securities borrowed represent the cash paid as collateral in a stock lending transaction.
The Group acts as an intermediary between our customers for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due to and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned note 16.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in the interest rate and currency risk management section note 10.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the carrying value may be impaired.
The consolidated amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

a Credit risk management The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its name give-up, matched principal, exchange-traded and corporate treasury operations.
The risk in respect of the name give-up, post trade risk and information businesses is limited to the collection of outstanding commission and transaction fees and this is managed proactively by the Groups credit control function.
The exposure to credit loss is limited to the value of the receivable.
The Group does not bear any significant concentration risk to either counterparts or markets.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as counterparty on trades which may involve one or more financial instruments and or counterparties.
Matched principal transactions are undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis.
The Group manages its credit risk in these transactions through appropriate policies and procedures in order to mitigate counterparty risk through various methods including setting appropriate credit limits for all counterparts which are stringently monitored by the risk department to restrict any potential loss through counterparty default.
The credit risk on core cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is monitored on a daily basis.
All financial institutions that are transacted with must be approved by the GRACC and internal limits are assigned to each one based on a combination of factors including external credit ratings.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents is therefore held with financial institutions rated A or better by the major credit rating agencies.
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk at the year end.
The Groups counterparty risk is calculated using internal metrics in line with market standards which have been used for ICAAP calculation reporting on an annual basis.
After taking into account the probability of default of counterparties as per their counterparty internal ratings, the maximum capital exposure was less than 12% of Group capital.
At any point through the year, at least 80% of the Groups counterparty exposure is with institutions which have an internal rating of nine or higher nine is equivalent to an external rating of BBB Baa2.

Legal provisions represent amounts for certain claims brought against subsidiaries of the Group in relation to certain employee tax matters.
The provisions were those that have been acquired by the Group on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings.
33m of these provisions were released during the year as the risk of exposure was no longer expected to occur.
At the present time, the timing of any payment relating to the outstanding balances is uncertain and the matter is reviewed by the Group on a regular basis.
In the directors opinion, after taking legal advice, the outcome of these legal claims is not expected to give rise to any significant loss beyond the amounts provided at 31 March 2012.
Other provisions include obligations for certain employee-related costs and pension arrangements in the Group which are expected to be discharged over the next two years.
The maturity analysis of non-financial provisions is included within note 16.

Share capital continued f Capital management ICAP maintains an efficient and strong capital base which maximises the return to its shareholders, while also maintaining flexibility and ensuring compliance with supervisory regulatory requirements.
The Group has a centralised approach to capital management.
The GRACC reviews the capital structure on a regular basis and, as part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations presented by the committee to the board, the Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buybacks, as well as taking on new debt or refinancing existing debt.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings note 6, cash and cash equivalents note 7 b and equity, including share capital, share premium, other reserves note 19 a and retained earnings.
At 31 March 2012, the Groups net debt was 82m 2011 161m note 7 b. ICAP is an international business which provides brokerage and post trade risk and information services in a wide range of products to professional counterparties.
The business is subject to consolidated supervision by the FSA under the terms of the CRD, in addition to a number of the Groups trading companies being subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FSA in the UK and the SEC FINRA in the US.
ICAP benefits from a BIPRU Investment Firm Consolidation waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy tests which has the effect of excluding goodwill from the capital computation and, in so doing, allows the Group to undertake acquisitions using debt rather than equity finance.
The terms of the waiver, which runs until April 2016, limits the Groups ability to incur market risk and, in effect, prohibits the Group from undertaking proprietary trading activities.
The Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital headroom represents the difference between the capital resources of the Company, on a stand-alone basis, and the regulatory capital requirements of the Group calculated, in accordance with the requirements of the waiver, on an aggregate basis.
Pillar 1 headroom is approximately 0.9bn 2011 1.1bn and is relatively stable due to the low amount of market and credit risk in the Group, but may fluctuate due to timing of dividends.
ICAP also evaluates at a Group and individual legal entity level the risks facing the business, to determine whether its capital is sufficient to cover any expected losses.
The Group uses a scenario-based model which utilises data provided by the business to assess the economic capital required to cover the expected risks.
As at 31 March 2012, the Group and each of its UK regulated entities had sufficient Pillar 1 capital to cover their identified risks.
The process followed is consistent with the CRD requirement for ICAPs FSA regulated entities to perform an ICAAP under Pillar 2, the results of which are documented, updated and approved by the board and the UK regulated boards annually.
A number of the Groups trading companies are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FSA in the UK and the SEC FINRA in the US.
All such companies have complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
The regulatory environment continues to change and, while it will impact how the markets work and who operates them, the Group does not expect, based on draft rules currently available, a material change to result in its capital structure.
In general, higher levels of market volatility result in increased demand for the Groups brokerage and post trade risk and information services.
From a regulatory capital perspective, however, the impact is significantly dampened by the fact that much of this incremental business occurs in markets which operate on a name give-up basis or are cleared through a central counterparty.
Therefore, we would expect any increase in activity to have limited impact on the Groups capital resource requirement and, as such, absent a material acquisition, loss of the waiver or a change in the basis of computation, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to both operate and grow the business.

The capital redemption reserve was created as a result of shares cancelled in 1998 and 2005.
The revaluation reserve represents revaluations of available-for-sale investments and intangible assets.
The hedging reserve arises as a result of recognising the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments on the balance sheet.
The cost of shares held by employee share trusts of 31m 2011 37m and Treasury Shares 71m 2011 15m has been deducted from retained earnings.
The share-based payment reserve of 20m 2011 18m has been included in retained earnings.
b Company reserves The Company has retained earnings of 1,336m of which 657m is not distributable.
Share awards Employee share schemes The Group awards share options and other share-based payments as part of employee incentive schemes.
The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based payments for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting and is charged to employee costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding amount has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
A cancellation of a share award by the Group or an employee is treated consistently, resulting in an acceleration of the remaining charge within the consolidated income statement in the year of cancellation.
The total charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of employee share options in the year was 3m 2011 8m.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 8m 2011 5m.

Options granted under the SAYE are issued with a 20% discount on the market price as permitted by HMRC and those granted under the Traiana Plan were granted at the equivalent price to the original Traiana option.
The awards under the LTIP have no exercise price.
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Determining the value of a grant of equity instruments requires selecting an appropriate valuation model and estimating the required inputs to that model, including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
ICAP in 10 Business review Governance Financial statements Information for shareholders ICAP plc Annual Report 2012 Financial statements 119 20.

The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the share price over the past three years to the date of grant of the option.
On options where the employee receives a cash bonus in lieu of the dividend foregone the dividend yield is treated as nil and the fair value of the option is equal to the market value of the share.
i BSMP The BSMP is not approved by HMRC.

Acquisition of subsidiaries The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the costs of the acquisition are less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
When the Group increases its investment in an entity resulting in an associate becoming a subsidiary, the carrying value of the associate immediately prior to acquisition is revalued to fair value, with any gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement through the acquisition and disposal costs column, along with any items recycled from the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
A change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration received recognised directly in equity.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group derecognises the non-controlling interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the noncontrolling interest on exercise of those options.
The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid payable and the non-controlling interests share of net assets, is recognised in equity.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised within the consolidated income statement.
Where the Group has a call option over shares held by a noncontrolling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until it is certain that the option will be called.
At that point the accounting treatment is the same as for a put option.
a Acquisitions in the year During the year the Group acquired the following businesses, with the provisional numbers booked at 31 March 2012 disclosed below.
Island Shipbrokers Pte Ltd Island On 21 February 2012 the Group acquired 75% of the share capital in Island, a ship broking business based in Singapore.
Prior to the acquisition the Group owned 25% of Island which was held as an associate.
Initial cash consideration was 3m and contingent deferred consideration dependent on future profitability of the business is estimated as 3m.
Additionally the fair value of the previously held interest in the associate of 2m has been transferred to the investment in subsidiary.
The fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities totalled 6m, which includes customer relationships recognised on consolidation of 5m.
The balance of 2m represents goodwill relating to the acquisition.
Since acquisition Island has contributed nil to the Groups profit after tax, and had 100% of Island been held by the Group from the start of the year, the Groups profit after tax would be higher by a further 1m.
Sun The Group acquired 100% of Sun, a leading broker of European biofuels, on 27 February 2012 for cash consideration of 1m and contingent deferred consideration of 1m.
b Contingent deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions A number of acquisitions made by the Group are satisfied in part by contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill for acquisitions made prior to the adoption of IFRS3 revised Business combinations.
For acquisitions made since the adoption of IFRS3 revised, any adjustments made to contingent deferred consideration are made through the acquisition and disposal costs column of the consolidation income statement.
Included within contingent deferred consideration are balances contingent on the future profitability of investments made and amounts which are exercisable at certain dates in the future on put options written over shares held by non-controlling interests where the Group considers it highly likely that these options will be exercised.
At 31 March 2012 deferred contingent consideration of 9m was outstanding 2011 5m.
During the year 4m of contingent deferred consideration was booked on the acquisition of Island 3m and Sun 1m.

b Fair value estimation The Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
Instruments included in level 1 are traded in active markets and valued at quoted market prices available in open markets.
The fair value of a financial instrument that is not traded in an active market is determined using a valuation technique, for example derivative financial instruments.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific items.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
