The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Notes to the accounts For the year ended 30 September 2012 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION The Paragon Group of Companies PLC is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 with company number 2336032.
The address of the registered of ce is given on page 47.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report on pages 14 to 17.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED REPORTING STANDARDS In the preparation of these financial statements the following reporting standards are being applied for the first time.
IAS 24 Revised Related Party Disclosures: Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement.
The application of these standards has not required any amendments to disclosures previously reported, nor would the present financial statements have differed had these standards not been applied.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following International Financial Reporting Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 Revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment to IAS 19 Employee bene ts The adoption of IFRS 9, as currently in issue, would not be anticipated to have a material impact on the accounting of the Group although the International Accounting Standards Board IASB has announced its intention to expand this Standard in such a way that would require changes to the valuation and income recognition methods relating to the Groups loans to customers, borrowings and derivative assets and liabilities.
This Standard is currently intended to come into force for the financial year ending 30 September 2016, if the Standard is adopted by the European Union.
The European Union has declined to consider the endorsement of IFRS 9 until a complete version is issued by the IASB.
The Group has yet to conduct a full assessment of its potential impact, pending further information on endorsement from the European Union.
56 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC IFRS 10, 11 and 12 and the revised IAS 27 and 28 form the new IFRS regime for consolidation.
The directors do not expect that the entities included within the consolidated accounts will differ under the new standards from those presently consolidated, nor that the consolidated results will be changed, although the disclosures provided under the new standards may differ.
These standards, if adopted by the European Union, are expected to be applied for the first time in the Groups accounts for the year ending 30 September 2014.
IFRS 13, which, if adopted by the European Union is expected to apply to the Groups accounts from the year ending 30 September 2014 sets out new guidance on the establishment of fair value for accounting purposes and enhanced disclosures.
It will apply to all amounts in the Groups financial statements presented at fair value, but is unlikely, in the view of the directors, to have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
The revision to IAS 19, which is expected to apply to the Groups accounts for the year ending 30 September 2014, will change the amounts presented in the income statement in respect of the Groups pension plan, without affecting the surplus or fide cit shown in the balance sheet.
If that Standard had been in force for the financial year ended 30 September 2012 it is estimated that the effect would be to reduce pro t before tax by 0.4m 2011: 0.6m.
Other Standards and interpretations in issue but not effective do not address matters relevant to the Groups accounting and reporting.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.
The particular policies applied are described below.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as required in the valuation of certain financial instruments which are carried at fair value.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements deal with the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 30 September 2012.
Subsidiaries comprise all those entities over which the Group has control.
The results of businesses acquired are dealt with in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition.
In accordance with SIC 12 Consolidation: Special Purpose Entities companies owned by charitable trusts into which loans originated by Mortgage Trust Limited were sold as part of its securitisation programme, where the Group enjoys the bene ts of ownership, are treated as subsidiaries.
Similarly, trusts set up to hold shares in conjunction with the Groups employee share ownership arrangements are also treated as subsidiaries.
c Going concern The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
The directors reasons for the adoption of this basis are given in the Corporate Governance Statement on page 44.
Notes to the accounts 57 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC d Goodwill Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, representing the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair values of acquired assets, including intangible assets, is held on the balance sheet and reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment has occurred.
Negative goodwill is written off as it arises.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations to combinations taking place before its transition date to IFRS 1 October 2004.
Therefore any goodwill which was written off to reserves under UK GAAP will not be charged or credited to the pro t and loss account on any future disposal of the business to which it relates.
e Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise purchased computer software and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations.
Purchased computer software is capitalised where it has a suf ciently enduring nature and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 25% per annum.
Other intangible assets acquired in business combinations include brands and business networks and are capitalised in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Such assets are stated at attributed cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is provided in equal instalments at a rate of 6.67% per annum.
f Leases Leases are accounted for as operating or finance leases in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
A finance lease is deemed to be one which transfers substantially all of the risks and rewards of the ownership of the asset concerned.
Any other lease is an operating lease.
Rental income and costs under operating leases are credited or charged to the pro t and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the leases.
g Contract hire Motor vehicles acquired in connection with contract hire arrangements are sold to finance houses, who lease them to customers for a pre-determined period.
The Group has undertaken to repurchase these vehicles at the end of the lease term.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 17, the assets are not derecognised on the sale to the finance house and remain as the Groups assets and the consideration received is spread over the customers lease term.
58 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC h Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost for property held under a sale and leaseback transaction represents the sale value.
Depreciation is provided on cost in equal annual instalments over the lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold premises 2% per annum Short leasehold premises over the term of the lease Computer hardware 25% per annum Furniture, xtures and of ce equipment 15% per annum Company motor vehicles 25% per annum Motor vehicles subject to contract hire arrangements over the term of the lease i Investments in subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are valued at cost less provision for impairment.
j Loans to customers Loans to customers are considered to be loans and receivables as fide ned by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are therefore accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
Loans advanced are valued at inception at the initial advance amount, which is the fair value at that time, inclusive of procuration fees paid to brokers or other business providers and less initial fees paid by the customer.
Loans acquired from third parties are initially valued at the purchase consideration paid or payable.
Thereafter, all loans to customers are valued at this initial amount less the cumulative amortisation calculated using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method.
The loan balances are then reduced where necessary by a provision for balances which are considered to be impaired.
The EIR method spreads the expected net income arising from a loan over its expected life.
The EIR is that rate of interest which, at inception, exactly discounts the future cash payments and receipts arising from the loan to the initial carrying amount.
The Groups policy is to hedge against any exposure to xed rate loan assets.
k Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within Loans to Customers at the total amount receivable less interest not yet accrued, unamortised commissions and provision for doubtful debts.
Income from finance lease contracts is accounted for on the actuarial basis.
l Impairment of loans and receivables Loans and receivables are reviewed for indications of possible impairment throughout the year and at each balance sheet date, in accordance with IAS 39.
Where loans exhibit objective evidence of impairment, the carrying value of the loans is reduced to the net present value of their expected future cash ows, including the value of the potential realisation of any security, discounted at the original EIR.
Loans are assessed collectively, grouped by risk characteristics and account is taken of any impairment arising due to events which are believed to have taken place but have not been speci cally identi ed at the balance sheet date.
Notes to the accounts 59 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC For financial accounting purposes provisions for impairments of loans to customers are held in an allowance account.
These balances are offset against the gross value of the loan when it is written off on the administration system.
After this point a salvage balance may be held in respect of any further recoveries expected on the loan.
m Investments in structured entities Investments in structured entities are intended to be held to maturity and are therefore accounted for on the amortised cost basis.
The return from such investments is calculated on the EIR basis.
n Amounts owed by or to group companies In the accounts of the Company balances owed by or to other group companies are carried at the current amount outstanding less any provision.
Where balances owing between group companies fall within the fide nition of either financial assets or financial liabilities given in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation they are classi ed as Loans and Receivables or Other financial liabilities, respectively.
o Cash and cash equivalents Balances shown as cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise demand deposits and short-term deposits with banks with initial maturities of not more than 90 days.
p Own shares Shares in The Paragon Group of Companies PLC held in treasury or by the trustees of the Groups employee share ownership plans are shown on the balance sheet as a deduction in arriving at total equity.
Own shares are stated at cost.
q Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the pro t for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences.
Temporary differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Tax relating to items taken directly to equity is also taken directly to equity.
r Borrowings Borrowings are carried in the balance sheet on the amortised cost basis.
The initial value recognised includes the principal amount received less any discount on issue or costs of issuance.
Interest and all other costs of the funding are expensed to the income statement as interest payable over the term of the borrowing on an Effective Interest Rate basis.
Gains on the purchase of the Groups Floating Rate Notes or corporate bonds are recognised as income at the time of the transaction.
s Finance lease payables Balances due on the lease arising from the sale and leaseback of a Group property are recognised in creditors at the total amount payable less interest not yet accrued.
Interest is accrued on the actuarial basis.
The pro t which arose on the sale and leaseback transaction is held within deferred income and is being credited to pro t over the lease term on a straight line basis.
60 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC t Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group comprise currency swap, interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk pro le of the existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All derivatives are carried in the balance sheet at fair value, as assets where the value is positive or as liabilities where the value is negative.
Fair value is based on market prices, where a market exists.
If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using present value models which incorporate assumptions based on market conditions and are consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognised in the income statement, except where such amounts are permitted to be taken to equity as part of the accounting for a cash ow hedge.
u Hedging For all hedges, the Group documents, at inception, the relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management strategy and objectives for undertaking the transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging arrangements put in place are considered to be highly effective as fide ned by IAS 39.
For a fair value hedge, as long as the hedging relationship is deemed highly effective and meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39, any gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in income can be offset against the fair value loss or gain arising from the hedged item for the hedged risk.
For macro hedges hedges of interest rate risk for a portfolio of loan assets this fair value adjustment is disclosed in the balance sheet alongside the hedged item, for other hedges the adjustment is made to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability.
Only the net ineffectiveness of the hedge is charged or credited to income.
Where a fair value hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the fair value adjustment is amortised over the remaining term of the underlying item.
Where a derivative is used to hedge the variability of cash ows of an asset or liability, it may be designated as a cash ow hedge so long as this relationship meets the hedging requirements of IAS 39.
For such an instrument the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is taken initially to equity, with the ineffective part taken to pro t or loss.
The amount taken to equity is released to the income statement at the same time as the hedged item affects the income statement.
Where a cash ow hedge relationship is terminated, or deemed ineffective, the amount taken to equity will remain there until the hedged transaction is recognised, or is no longer highly probable.
v Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as probable that they will be recovered.
As required by IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to take account of the expected timing of realisation.
w Retirement bene t obligations The expected cost of providing pensions within the funded fide ned bene t scheme, determined on the basis of annual valuations by professionally quali ed actuaries using the projected unit method, is charged to the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and do not form part of the result for the period, being recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The retirement bene t obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the fide ned bene t obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Both the return on investment expected in the period and the expected nancing cost of the liability, as estimated at the beginning of the period are recognised in the result for the period.
Any variances against these estimates in the year form part of the actuarial gain or loss.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The charge to the income statement for providing pensions under fide ned contribution pension schemes is equal to the contributions payable to such schemes for the year.
Notes to the accounts 61 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC x Provisions Provisions are recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that this obligation will result in an out ow of resources and this out ow can be reliably quanti ed.
Provisions are discounted where this effect is material.
y Revenue The revenue of the Group comprises interest receivable and similar charges and other income.
The accounting policy for the recognition of each element of revenue is described separately within these accounting policies.
z Fee and commission income Other income includes administration fees charged to borrowers, which are credited when the related service is performed, fees charged to third parties for account administration services, which are credited as those services are performed, and commissions receivable on the sale of insurances, which are taken to pro t at the point at which the Group becomes unconditionally entitled to the income.
aa Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share based payments, the fair value at the date of grant of awards to be made in respect of options and shares granted under the terms of the Groups various share based employee incentive arrangements is charged to the pro t and loss account over the period between the date of grant and the vesting date.
As permitted by IFRS 1, only those options and awards granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested at 1 January 2005 have been restated on transition to IFRS.
National Insurance on share based payments is accrued over the vesting period, based on the share price at the balance sheet date.
Where the allowable cost of share based awards for tax purposes is greater than the cost determined in accordance with IFRS 2, the tax effect of the excess is taken to reserves.
bb Dividends In accordance with IAS 10 Events after the balance sheet date, dividends payable on ordinary shares are recognised in equity once they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date, but before the authorisation of the financial statements remain within shareholders funds.
cc Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions, assets and liabilities are accounted for in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
The functional currency of the Group is the pound sterling.
Transactions which are not denominated in sterling are translated into sterling at the spot rate of exchange on the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities which are not denominated in sterling are translated at the closing rate on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on retranslation are included in interest payable or interest receivable depending on whether the underlying instrument is an asset or a liability, except where deferred in equity in accordance with the cash ow hedging provisions of IAS 39. dd Segmental reporting The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described above for the Group as a whole.
Costs attributed to each segment represent the direct costs incurred by the segment operations and an allocation of the costs of areas of the business which serve all segments.
Such allocations are weighted by the value of loan assets in each segment, adjusted for the relative effort involved in the administration of each asset class.
62 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 4.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Certain of the balances reported in the financial statements are based wholly or in part on estimates or assumptions made by the directors.
There is, therefore, a potential risk that they may be subject to change in future periods.
The most signi cant of these are: a Impairment losses on loans to customers Impairment losses on loans are calculated based on statistical models.
The key assumptions revolve around estimates of future cash ows from customers accounts, their timing and, for secured accounts, the expected proceeds from the realisation of the property.
These key assumptions are based on observed data from historical patterns and are updated regularly based on new data as it becomes available.
In addition the directors consider how appropriate past trends and patterns might be in the current economic situation and make any adjustments they believe are necessary to re ect the current conditions.
The accuracy of the impairment calculations would therefore be affected by unexpected changes to the economic situation, variances between the models used and the actual results, or assumptions which differ from the actual outcomes.
In particular, if the impact of economic factors such as employment levels on customers is worse than is implicit in the model then the number of accounts requiring provision might be greater than suggested by the model, while falls in house prices, over and above any assumed by the model might increase the provision required in respect of accounts currently provided.
b Effective interest rates In order to determine the effective interest rate applicable to loans an estimate must be made of the expected life of each loan and hence the cash ows relating thereto.
For purchased accounts this will involve estimating the likely future performance of the accounts at the time of acquisition.
These estimates are based on historical data and reviewed regularly.
For purchased accounts historical data obtained from the vendor will be examined.
The accuracy of the effective interest rate applied would therefore be compromised by any differences between actual borrower behaviour and that predicted.
c Fair values Where financial assets and liabilities are carried at fair value, in the majority of cases this can be derived by reference to quoted market prices.
Where such a quoted price is not available the valuation is based on cash ow models based, where possible, on independently sourced parameters.
The accuracy of the calculation would therefore be affected by unexpected market movements or other variances in the operation of the models or the assumptions used.
d Retirement bene ts The present value of the retirement bene t obligation is derived from an actuarial calculation which rests on a number of assumptions.
Where actual conditions differ from those assumed the ultimate value of the obligation would be different.
e Goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition The value of goodwill and intangible assets recognised on the Groups acquisition of TBMC was derived from the projected cash ows for that business at the time of acquisition, based on management forecasts.
The accuracy of this valuation would therefore be compromised by any differences between these forecasts and the levels of business activity that the entity might actually have been able to generate in the absence of the acquisition.
This valuation will also be affected by the accuracy of the discount factor used.
The carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets is dependent on the accuracy of the inputs into the impairment test described in note 24.
Notes to the accounts 63 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 5.
CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives in managing capital are: To ensure that the Group has suf cient capital to meet its operational requirements and strategic objectives: To safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders: and To provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk, availability and cost.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets, having particular regard to the relative costs and availability of debt and equity finance at any given time.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, issue or redeem other capital instruments, such as corporate bonds, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Since its rights issue in 2008 the Group has pursued a progressive dividend policy with the dividend being increased from 3.0p in respect of that year to 4.0p in respect of the year ended 30 September 2011.
As a result of the progress of the business since that date the directors have now adopted a new policy under which the dividends will increase so that, by the year ending 30 September 2016, the level of dividend cover will be maintained in the range 3.0 to 3.5 times.
The level of dividend cover in respect of the year, subject to the approval of the final dividend at the Annual General Meeting is shown below.
Note 2012 2011 Pro t after tax for the year m 72.2 59.6 Proposed dividend in respect of the year m 44 17.8 11.9 Dividend cover times 4.1 5.0 Return on equity is fide ned by the Group by comparing the pro t after tax for the year to the average of the opening and closing equity positions and is derived as follows: 2012 2011 m m Pro t for the year 72.2 59.6 Divided by Opening equity 742.0 692.0 Closing equity 803.5 742.0 Average equity 772.7 717.0 Return on equity 9.3% 8.3% 64 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Board of Directors regularly review the proportion of working capital represented by debt and equity.
Net debt is calculated as total debt, other than securitised and warehouse debt, valued at principal value, less free cash up to a maximum of the total debt.
Adjusted equity comprises all components of equity i. e. share capital, share premium, minority interest, retained earnings, and revaluation surplus other than amounts recognised in equity relating to cash ow hedges.
The debt and equity amounts at 30 September 2012 and at 30 September 2011 were as follows: 2012 2011 m m Debt Corporate bond 110.0 110.0 Bank overdraft 0.6 0.6 Less: Applicable free cash 110.6 110.6 Net debt - - Equity Total equity 803.5 742.0 Less: cash ow hedging reserve 0.7 1.8 Adjusted equity 802.8 740.2 Total working capital 802.8 740.2 Debt - - Equity 100.0% 100.0% Total working capital 100.0% 100.0% In addition the Group held 17.1m of free cash in excess of that shown above 2011: 84.4m.
The stable proportion of working capital represented by equity during 2012 resulted primarily from the operation of the policy described above.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The principal financial risks arising from the Groups normal business activities are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Board operates through the Credit Committee and the Asset and Liability Committee to review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as described in the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 40 to 44, and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year and since the year end.
The position disclosed below is materially similar to that existing throughout the year.
Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are used only to limit the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Groups derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes only.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from xed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under the IAS 39 rules, while in other cases hedge accounting has not been adopted either because natural accounting offsets are expected or because complying with the IAS 39 hedge accounting rules would be especially onerous.
Notes to the accounts 65 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the interest rate risk of groups of xed rate pre-payable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets.
b hedging the interest rate risk of xed rate corporate bond borrowings with a designated xed to oating interest rate swap, which was taken out for this speci c purpose.
The Group has also designated cash ow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a speci ed foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
The only derivative financial instrument held by the Company at 30 September 2011 was the swap related to the xed rate corporate bond borrowing described above.
This reached its term in the year and the Company now has no derivative assets or liabilities.
Credit risk The Groups business objectives rely on maintaining a high-quality customer base and place strong emphasis on good credit management, both at the time of acquiring or underwriting a new loan, where strict lending criteria are applied, and in the collections process.
Primary responsibility for credit risk management across the Group lies with the Credit Committee.
The Credit Committee is made up of four senior members of staff, headed by the Finance Director.
Its key responsibilities include setting and reviewing credit policy, controlling applicant quality, tracking account performance against targets, agreeing product criteria and lending guidelines and monitoring performance and trends.
The assets of the Group and the Company which are subject to credit risk are set out below: The Group The Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 Note m m m m Loans to customers 31 8,694.6 8,724.2 - - Investments in securities 34 9.1 11.8 - - Derivative financial assets 35 800.4 1,151.8 - 4.0 Amounts owed by Group companies 36 - - 80.1 79.9 Accrued interest 36 0.2 0.5 - 0.1 Cash 37 504.8 571.6 124.5 189.2 Maximum exposure to credit risk 10,009.1 10,459.9 204.6 273.2 The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its loans to customers.
While this maximum exposure represents the potential loss which might have to be accounted for by the Group, the terms on which the Groups loan assets are funded, described under Liquidity Risk below, limit the amount of principal repayments on the Groups securitised and warehouse borrowings in cases of capital losses on assets, signi cantly reducing the effective shareholder value at risk.
66 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Groups loan assets at 30 September 2012 are analysed as follows: 2012 2012 2011 2011 m % m % Buy-to-let mortgages 8,196.4 94.3% 8,231.7 94.3% Owner occupied mortgages 99.2 1.1% 128.7 1.5% Total first mortgages 8,295.6 95.4% 8,360.4 95.8% Secured loans 279.9 3.2% 340.1 3.9% Loans secured on property 8,575.5 98.6% 8,700.5 99.7% Car loans 2.5 0.1% 7.5 0.1% Retail finance loans 2.0 - 2.9 - Other loans 114.6 1.3% 13.3 0.2% Total loans to customers 8,694.6 100.0% 8,724.2 100.0% Other loans include unsecured loans either advanced by Group companies or acquired from their originators at a discount.
There are no signi cant concentrations of credit risk due to the large number of customers included in the portfolios.
The Groups underwriting philosophy is based on a combination of sophisticated individual credit assessment and the automated ef ciencies of a scored decision making process.
Information on each applicant is combined with data taken from a credit reference bureau to provide a complete credit picture of the applicant and the borrowing requested.
Key information is validated through a combination of documentation and statistical data which collectively provides evidence of the applicants ability and willingness to pay the amount contracted under the loan agreement.
First mortgages and secured loans are secured by charges over residential properties in England and Wales, or similar Scottish or Northern Irish securities.
Car loans are effectively secured by the nanced vehicle.
Despite this security, in assessing credit risk, an applicants ability and propensity to repay the loan remain the principal factors in the decision to lend.
In considering whether to acquire pools of loan assets or invest in loan portfolios, the Group will undertake a due diligence exercise on the underlying loan accounts.
Such assets are generally not fully performing and are offered at a discount to their current balance.
The Groups procedures may include inspection of original loan documents, veri cation of security and the examination of the credit status of borrowers.
Current and historic cash ow data will also be examined.
The objective of the exercise is to establish, to a level of con dence similar to that provided by the underwriting process, that the assets will generate suf cient cash ows to recover the Groups investment and generate an appropriate return.
Investments in structured entities represent the Groups contribution made to special purpose vehicle SPV companies established and controlled by third parties to purchase pools of loan assets.
All such investments are denominated in sterling and the underlying loans are made to United Kingdom borrowers.
Cash generated by the assets is distributed to investors in accordance with a speci ed priority of payments.
The Group has no obligation to make further contributions to the SPV companies concerned.
The management has considered the position of the underlying assets and concluded that they will generate suf cient cash ows to repay the amount of the investment.
In order to control credit risk relating to counterparties to the Groups derivative financial instruments and cash deposits, the Asset and Liability Committee determines which counterparties the Group will deal with, establishes limits for each counterparty and monitors compliance with those limits.
Such counterparties ar e typically highly rated banks and, for all cash deposits and derivative positions held within the Groups securitisation structures, must comply with criteria set out in the nancing arrangements.
Where a derivative counterparty fails to meet the required criteria they are obliged under the terms of the instruments to set aside a cash collateral deposit.
The amounts of these cash collateral deposits, which do not form part of the Groups cash position, are given in note 35.
Notes to the accounts 67 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The Groups cash balances are held in sterling at London banks in current accounts and as short xed term deposits.
Credit risk on these balances, and the interest accrued thereon, is considered to be immaterial.

68 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The number of accounts in arrears will be higher for closed books such as the owner-occupied mortgage book and the car finance, retail finance and unsecured loan books than for comparable active ones, as performing accounts pay off their balances, leaving arrears accounts representing a greater proportion of the total.
The gures shown above for secured loans and other loans include purchased portfolios which generally include a high proportion of cases in arrears at the time of purchase and where this level of performance is allowed for in the discount to current balance represented by the purchase price.

The Groups originated loan assets are principally nanced by asset backed loan notes Notes issued through the securitisation process.
In a securitisation deal an SPV company within the Group will issue Notes secured on a pool of mortgage or other loan assets owned by the SPV.
The Notes have a maturity date later than the final repayment date for any asset in the pool, typically over 30 years from the issue date.
The noteholders are entitled to receive repayment of the Note principal out of principal funds generated by the loan assets from time to time, but their right to the repayment of principal is limited to the cash available in the SPV.
Similarly, payment of accrued interest to the noteholders is limited to cash generated within the SPV.
There is no requirement for any Group company other than the issuing SPV to make principal or interest payments in respect of the Notes.
This matching of the maturities of the assets and the related funding substantially reduces the Groups exposure to liquidity risk.
Details of Notes in issue are given in note 48 and the assets backing the Notes are shown in notes 29 and 30.
In the Groups consumer finance SPVs, principal cash was not required to be repaid to noteholders during an initial period, but instead could be used to acquire new loans from the Group, subject to underwriting conditions being met.
Following the completion of this initial period, principal cash is repaid in the same way as for other SPVs.
The Group also provides funding to the SPV at inception, subordinated to the Notes, which means that credit risk on the pool assets is retained within the Group.
The Group receives the residual income generated by the assets.
These factors mean that the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets remain with the Group, and hence the loans remain on the Groups balance sheet.
Cash received in each SPV is held until the next interest payment date, after which the remaining balances become available to the Group.
Cash balances are also held within each SPV to provide credit enhancement for the particular securitisation, allowing principal payments to be made even if loans default.
In order to provide further credit enhancement in certain of the SPVs there exist speci c economic trigger events which cause additional cash to be retained in the SPV, rather than being transferred to the Group.
While the Group can, if it chooses, contribute additional cash to cover these requirements, it is under no obligation to do so.
No such trigger event has occurred to date in any of the Groups SPVs and whether one arises in the future will depend on the performance of the general economy and its impact on mortgage and loan arrears.
However if such trigger events occurred in all of the SPVs, a total of 67.9m of additional cash would be retained in those companies 2011: 66.0m.
The cash balances of the SPV companies are included within the restricted cash balances disclosed in note 37.
Newly originated mortgage loans are initially funded by a revolving loan facility or warehouse from the point of their origination until their inclusion in a securitisation deal.
A warehouse functions in a similar way to an SPV, except that funds are drawn down as advances are made and repaid when loans are securitised.
On 29 February 2008 the warehouse facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited ceased to be available for new drawings, although assets held within it at that time continued to be funded.
Repayment of the principal on these assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them.
The final repayment date of the facility is later than the final due date of the assets it is used to fund.
On 27 September 2010 Macquarie Bank and Paragon Fourth Funding Limited signed a new warehouse facility agreement, which was renewed on substantially the same terms following the end of the financial year.
This warehouse is available for drawing and redrawing until 13 December 2014 and is used to fund new first charge mortgage loans.
After that date the loan has a further two year period for the assets funded to be sold or re nanced.
Repayment of the principal drawn in respect of assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the two year period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowing.
On 27 September 2012 the wholesale division of Lloyds Bank and Paragon Fifth Funding Limited signed an additional warehouse facility agreement, which was undrawn at 30 September 2012 but which will operate in parallel with the existing Paragon Fourth Funding facility.
The term of the facility is three years and it will be available to fund new loans in its first 18 months, or up to 24 months if a securitisation of funded assets is achieved in the first year.
As with the Paragon Fourth Funding facility repayment of the principal drawn in respect of assets is not required unless amounts are realised from them either through repayment, securitisation or asset sales, even after the initial period.
There is no further recourse to other assets of the Group in respect of either interest or principal on the borrowing As with the SPVs, the Group provides subordinated funding to the warehouse companies and restricted cash balances are held within them.
Further details of the warehouse facilities are given in note 48 and details of the loan assets within the warehouses are given in note 29.
Notes to the accounts 71 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Between 29 February 2008 and 4 October 2010 the only advances made by the Group were consumer loans and further advances on existing mortgage accounts, which were funded from existing drawings in the SPV companies.
The provision of new consumer loans ceased on 9 April 2009, except for further advances on existing accounts, when the period over which new loans could be sold to the consumer finance SPVs ended.
New first mortgage lending commenced on 5 October 2010.
The securitisation process and the terms of the warehouse facilities effectively limit liquidity risk from the funding of the Groups loan assets.
It remains to ensure that suf cient funding is available to fund the Groups participation in the SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset and Liability Committee which sets the Groups liquidity policy and uses detailed cash ow projections to ensure that an adequate level of liquidity is available at all times.
The final repayment date for all of the securitisation borrowings and the old warehouse borrowing is more than five years from the balance sheet date, the earliest falling due in 2033 and the latest in 2050.
The equivalent sterling principal amount outstanding at 30 September 2012 under the SPV and warehouse arrangements, allowing for the effect of the cross currency basis swaps, described under currency risk below, which are net settled with the loan payments, was 8,240.6m 2011: 8,404.4m.
The total sterling amount payable under these arrangements, were these principal amounts to remain outstanding until the final repayment date would be 16,429.1m 2011: 17,947.4m.
As the principal will, as discussed above, reduce as customers repay or redeem their accounts, the cash ow will in practice be far less than this amount.
The Groups investments in purchased loan portfolios and structured entities are funded from its free cash balances and these investments carry no obligation to make further payments.
They therefore pose no liquidity risk to the Group.
The total undiscounted amounts, inclusive of estimated interest, which would be payable in respect of the Groups other borrowings, should those balances remain outstanding until the contracted repayment date, together with amounts payable in respect of the other accruals shown in note 53 are shown below.
Corporate bond Other accruals Total m m m 30 September 2012 Payable in less than one year 4.1 11.8 15.9 Payable in one to two years 4.1 - 4.1 Payable in two to five years 122.3 - 122.3 Payable in over five years - - - 130.5 11.8 142.3 30 September 2011 Payable in less than one year 7.7 11.7 19.4 Payable in one to two years 7.8 0.1 7.9 Payable in two to five years 23.1 - 23.1 Payable in over five years 117.7 - 117.7 156.3 11.8 168.1 The cash ows described above will include those for interest on borrowings accrued at 30 September 2012 disclosed in note 53.
72 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The cash ows which are expected to arise from derivative contracts in place at the year end, estimating future oating rate payments and receipts on the basis of the yield curve at the balance sheet date are as follows: 2012 2011 Total cash Total cash out ow in ow out ow in ow m m On derivative liabilities Payable in less than one year 1.6 2.5 Payable in one to two years 0.4 2.3 Payable in two to five years 0.8 1.6 Payable in over five years 2.8 5.9 5.6 12.3 On derivative assets Payable in less than one year 0.4 5.0 Payable in one to two years 0.3 4.6 Payable in two to five years 0.8 11.5 Payable in over five years 2.7 8.2 4.2 29.3 1.4 17.0 Interest rate risk The Group manages interest rate risk, the risk that margins will be adversely affected by movements in market interest rates, by maintaining oating rate liabilities and matching these with oating rate assets, hedging xed rate assets and liabilities by the use of interest rate swap or cap agreements.
The rates of interest payable on the loan facilities and on asset backed loan notes issued in the securitisation process are reset quarterly on the basis of LIBOR.
Where asset backed loan notes are issued in foreign currencies, cross-currency basis swaps are put in place converting the reference interest rate to a sterling LIBOR basis.
The Groups loan assets predominantly bear LIBOR-linked interest rates or are hedged xed rate assets.
The interest rates charged on the Groups variable rate loan assets are determined by reference to, inter alia, the Groups funding costs and the rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Groups loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
The return to the Group from its investments in structured entities is primarily attributable to the cash generation of the underlying portfolio.
There is no direct exposure to market interest rate risk.
Until the optional repayment date on 20 April 2012, the xed rate corporate bond was hedged by use of a long-term interest rate swap agreement, of notional principal equal to the principal amount of the bond, which converted the interest payable to a LIBOR-linked oating rate basis.
Since that date interest has been payable on the Bond at a xed rate of 3.729%.
The Group has entered into various interest rate basis swap arrangements to alter the effective basis of interest payments on certain borrowings to match the underlying assets, though due to their nature and the low notional value of these swaps, they do not have a signi cant impact on the Groups results.
The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Groups loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Groups securitisations.
To assess the Groups exposure to interest rate movements the notional impact of a 1% change in UK interest rates on the equity of the Group at 30 September 2012, and the notional annualised impact of such a change on the operating pro t of the Group, based on the year-end balance sheet have been calculated.
Notes to the accounts 73 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC On this basis a 1% increase in UK interest rates would reduce the Groups equity at 30 September 2012 by 4.0m 2011: 4.2m and increase pro t before tax by 8.4m 2011: 7.0m.
This calculation allows only for the direct effects of any change in UK interest rates.
In practice such a change might have wider economic consequences which would themselves potentially affect the Groups business and results.
Although certain of the Groups borrowings have interest rates dependant on US Dollar and Euro LIBOR rates, the effect of the cross currency basis swaps is such that the Groups results have no material exposure to movements in these rates.
The effects of independent 1% increases in US or Euro interest rates would be to increase the Groups equity by 1.2m 2011: 1.4m and 2.0m 2011: 2.3m respectively.
The only interest rate risk in the Company arose from the corporate bond described above, until it became a xed rate instrument in April 2012.
Assets and liabilities with other group companies bear interest at oating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date.
The finance lease bears notional interest only: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
Currency risk All of the Groups assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 48.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, a condition of the issue of these notes was that interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR-linked oating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk, and no sensitivity analysis is presented for currency risk.
The equivalent sterling principal amounts of notes in issue under these arrangements, and their carrying values at 30 September 2012 and 30 September 2011 are: 2012 2012 2011 2011 Equivalent Carrying Equivalent Carrying sterling principal value sterling principal value m m m m US dollar notes 2,867.5 3,342.7 2,956.0 3,573.7 Euro notes 1,983.0 2,313.3 2,038.5 2,571.6 4,850.5 5,656.0 4,994.5 6,145.3 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair values in the accounts.
The Group uses a number of techniques to determine the fair values of its derivative assets and liabilities, for which observable prices in active markets are not available.
These are principally present value calculations based on estimated future cash ows arising from the instruments, discounted using a risk adjusted interest rate.
The principal inputs to these valuation models are LIBOR benchmark interest rates for the currencies in which the instruments are denominated, sterling, euros and dollars.
The cross currency basis swaps have a notional principal related to the outstanding currency borrowings and therefore the estimated rate of repayment of these notes also affects the valuation of the swaps.
In order to determine the fair values the management applies valuation adjustments to observed data where that data would not fully re ect the attributes of the instrument being valued.
The management reviews the models used on an ongoing basis to ensure that the valuations produced are reasonable and re ect all relevant factors.
For assets and liabilities carried at fair value IFRS 7 requires that the measurements should be classi ed using a fair value hierarchy re ecting the inputs used, and fide fines three levels.
Level 1 measurements are unadjusted market prices, level 2 measurements are derived from observable data, such as market prices or rates, while level 3 measurements rely on signi cant inputs which are not derived from observable data.
As described above the valuations of the Groups derivatives are based on market information and they are therefore classi ed as level 2 measurements.
Details of these assets are given in note 35.
The Group had no financial assets or liabilities in the year ended 30 September 2012 or the year ended 30 September 2011 valued using level 1 or level 3 measurements.
74 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes, which are carried at amortised cost, are not materially different from their book values because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset on a quarterly basis.
While the Groups asset backed loan notes are listed, the quoted prices for an individual note may not be indicative of the fair value of the issue as a whole, due to the specialised nature of the market in such instruments and the limited number of investors participating in it.
In the absence of a liquid market in loan assets the directors have considered the estimated cash ows expected to arise from the Groups investments in its loans to customers and have concluded that the carrying value of these assets, determined on the amortised cost basis, is not signi cantly different from the fair value of the assets derived on a discounted cash ow basis.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION For internal reporting purposes the Group is organised into two major operating divisions, First Mortgages and Consumer Finance.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports segmental information.
The revenue generated by the First Mortgages segment includes interest and fees generated by the buy-to-let and owner-occupied mortgage assets and other income derived from first charge mortgages.
Consumer Finance revenue includes interest and fees generated by second charge loans, the residual car, retail finance and unsecured loan assets, and other sources of income derived from consumer loans.
Both of these divisions include assets originated internally and assets acquired from third parties.
All of the Groups operations are conducted in the United Kingdom, all revenues arise from external customers and there are no inter-segment revenues.
No customer contributes more than 10% of the revenue of the Group.
Financial information about these business segments is shown below.

These options vest so long as the grantee is still employed by the Group at the end of the vesting period and, where applicable, performance criteria have been satis ed.
The Executive schemes are no longer available for the grant of further awards.
The Group also operates an All Employee Share Option Sharesave scheme.
Grants under this scheme vest after the completion of the appropriate service period and subject to a savings requirement.
A reconciliation of movements in the number and weighted average exercise price of options over 1 ordinary shares during the year ended 30 September 2012 and the year ended 30 September 2011 is shown below.
The weighted average market price at exercise for share options exercised in the year was 168.47p 2011: 150.29p.
A number of the above options were granted to former employees whose rights terminate at the later of 12 months following redundancy or 42 months after the issue of the options.
The fair value of options granted is determined using a Binomial model.

Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The losses and gains are primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.
Such differences will reverse over time and have no impact on the cash ows of the Group.

During the year ended 30 September 2012 the Government enacted provisions further reducing the rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 and 23% from 1 April 2013.

The expected impact of the change to 25% on the values at which deferred tax amounts are expected to crystallise was accounted for in the year ended 30 September 2011, while the expected impacts of the changes to 24% and 23% have been accounted for in the year ended 30 September 2012.

The effect of any such changes on deferred tax balances will be accounted for in the period in which any such changes are enacted.

GOODWILL The goodwill carried in the accounts was recognised on the acquisition of The Business Mortgage Company and its subsidiaries TBMC in December 2008.
The cash generating unit to which this goodwill was attributed for impairment testing purposes was TBMC, which is the lowest level within the Group at which this goodwill is currently monitored, though the operations of the acquired entity will, in time, be integrated with those of the First Mortgage division.
An impairment review undertaken at 30 September 2009 indicated a write down of 6.0m which was charged to the pro t and loss account.
Further reviews were undertaken at 30 September 2012 and each intervening year-end, which indicated no further impairment.
The recoverable amount of TBMC used in this impairment testing is determined on a value in use basis using pre-tax cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by the Board covering a four year period.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash ow projection is 6.07% and cash ows beyond the four year budget are extrapolated using a 2.00% growth rate, being the average long term growth rate in the United Kingdom economy over a 20 year period.
88 Notes to the accounts The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The key assumptions underlying the value in use calculation for the TBMC business are: Level of business activity, based on management expectations.
Management have concluded that the levels of activity assumed for the purpose of this forecast are reasonable, based on past experience and the current economic environment Discount rate, which is based on the Groups cost of capital The directors believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions above would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

All borrowers are required to make monthly payments, except where an initial deferred period is included in the contractual terms.
Under the terms of certain first mortgage products, the customer has the right to draw down further funds.
At 30 September 2012 the Groups commitment in respect of such facilities was 32.3m 2011: 37.0m.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES All of the Groups financial derivatives are held for economic hedging purposes, although not all may be designated for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.
The analysis below therefore splits derivatives between those accounted for as hedges and those which, while representing an economic hedge, do not qualify for this treatment.
All of the financial derivatives shown are valued using methodologies where the principal inputs are directly or indirectly derived from market data and are therefore classi ed within level two of the fair value hierarchy laid down by IFRS 7.
The Groups securitisation borrowings are denominated in sterling, euros and US dollars.
All currency borrowings are swapped at inception so that they have the effect of sterling borrowings.
These swaps provide an effective hedge against exchange rate movements, but the requirement to carry them at fair value leads, when exchange rates have moved signi cantly since the issue of the notes, to large balances for the swaps being carried in the balance sheet.
This is currently the case with both euro and US dollar swaps, although the debit balance is compensated for by retranslating the borrowings at the current exchange rate.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within Financial Assets note 28 and Financial Liabilities note 47 respectively.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a funded fide ned bene t pension scheme in the UK the Plan.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2010 and updated to 30 September 2012 by a quali ed independent actuary.
The liabilities of the Plan are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is re ected in the liability in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued bene ts valuation method in which the technical provisions are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the control period again allowing for future salary growth.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salaries is expected to increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
However, the membership is expected to reduce so that the service charge in monetary terms will gradually reduce.
The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms : 30 September 30 September 30 September 2012 2011 2010 In determining net pension cost for the year Discount rate 5.25% 5.20% 5.70% Expected long term rate of return on scheme assets 5.90% 6.30% 6.60% Rate of compensation increase 4.10% 4.00% 4.20% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued befor e 6 April 2006 3.10% 3.00% 3.20% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 3.10% 3.00% 2.50% in deferment 3.00% 3.00% 3.20% In determining bene t obligations Discount rate 4.60% 5.25% 5.20% Rate of compensation increase 3.65% 4.10% 4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued befor e 6 April 2006 2.65% 3.10% 3.00% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 2.65% 3.10% 2.50% in deferment 2.55% 3.00% 3.00% Further life expectancy at age 60 Pensioner male 30 30 30 Pensioner female 32 32 33 Non-r etired member male 32 32 31 Non-r etired member female 34 34 35 Notes to the accounts 109 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The assets in the Plan at 30 September 2012, 30 September 2011 and 30 September 2010 and the expected rates of return were: At 30 September 2012 At 30 September 2011 At 30 September 2010 Long Value Long Value Long Value term rate term rate term rate of return of return of return expected m expected m expected m Equities 6.05% 40.7 6.75% 34.0 7.25% 35.2 Bonds 3.60% 22.5 4.65% 19.3 4.40% 16.8 Other 4.60% 6.1 5.30% 5.8 5.80% 5.2 Total market value of assets 5.10% 69.3 5.90% 59.1 6.28% 57.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 83.2 73.5 73.7 fide cit in the scheme 13.9 14.4 16.5 The Plan assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the Plan are required to act in the best interests of the Plans bene ciaries.
The appointment of trustees to the Plan is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the Plan.
At 30 September 2012 the Plan assets were invested in a diversi ed portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and gilt investments.
The majority of the equities held by the Plan are in developed markets.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2013 are 50% equities, 30% bonds and 20% other assets.
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has continued to conduct asset-liability reviews of the Plan.
These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Plan.
The results of the studies are used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a signi cant increase in the scheme fide cit by providing information used to determine the investment strategy of the Plan.
Following the 2010 actuarial valuation, the trustees put in place a recovery plan.
The trustees recovery plan aims to meet the statutory funding objective within seven years and three months from the date of valuation, i. e. by 30 June 2017.
The rate of return expected on scheme assets is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Preserved 154.81 Square metres of Land.
The estimated carbon impact of this publication comes from a calculator developed by the Edinburgh Centre of Carbon Management ECCM.
It is derived from data supplied by the paper mill or, where this is not available, generic industry factors as determined by ECCM.
The estimated carbon impacts are measured with the point of delivery being the printers doorstep.
What is Carbon Balanced Paper?
Carbon Balanced, put simply, is where the carbon impact of a product or service has been estimated and an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide is either prevented from being released or is absorbed from the atmosphere.
Carbon Balancing is facilitated by the World Land Trust, an ecological charity which ensures a companys peace of mind regarding the credibility and integrity of how carbon impacts are balanced offset.
Carbon Balancing is achieved through land purchase of ecologically important standing forests, under imminent threat of clearance, where carbon is locked that would otherwise be released.
These protected forests are then able to continue absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.
