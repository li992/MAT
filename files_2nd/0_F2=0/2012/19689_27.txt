Employees must remain in service for a period of five years from the date of grant before exercising their options.
The option period ends six months following the end of the vesting period.
The Group also has an executive share option scheme and performance share plan PSP, full details of which are given in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
The following table illustrates the movements in share options during the year.
As the PSP includes the grant of options at nil exercise price the weighted average prices below are calculated including and excluding the options under this plan.
The fair values calculated and the assumptions used are as follows: Charge to Income Risk-free Expected Dividend Share Statement interest rate volatility yield price m % % % th 30 November 2012 0.3 0.4-1.1 37.6-56.9 1.6 1.23-2.00 th 30 November 2011 0.2 0.4-1.1 23.4-56.1 2.4 1.23 th For 2012 based on the earlier of the 90 day average to 30 November 2011 or the closing share price at the date of grant.
For 2011 based on the 90 day average to th 30 November 2011.
The fair value of the Balance Sheet liability in respect of share options outstanding at the year end was 2.4m 2011: 2.1m and included 0.4m 2011: 0.1m in respect of options that had vested at the year end.
In arriving at fair value it has been assumed that, when vested, shares options are exercised in accordance with historical trends.
Expected volatility was determined by reference to the historical volatility of the Group's share price over a period consistent with the expected life of the options.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 1.97 2011: 1.37.
The executive share options outstanding at the year end had a range of exercise prices between 1.14 and 3.75 2011: 1.14 and 4.10 with PSP options exercisable at nil 2011: nil.
Outstanding options had a weighted average maximum remaining contractual life of 9 years 2011: 8.7 years.

The effective tax rate for the Group including joint ventures and associates is a charge of 19.9% 2011: 12.0% credit.
th The Finance Act 2012 was enacted on 17 July 2012 and included provisions which reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 24% st st from 1 April 2012 and 23% from 1 April 2013.
Current tax has therefore been provided at 24.67% and deferred tax at 23%.
Further st reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate to 21% by 1 April 2014.
This has not been enacted at the Balance Sheet date and, therefore, is not included in these Financial Statements.
st The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax to 21% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted substantively in st Finance Act 2013.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 1 April 2014, the effect of the changes from 23% to 21% would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 0.7m.

The operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject to a number of issues including the strength of the property market.

The directors consider that the carrying amount recorded in the Financial Statements approximates their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value.
The fair value is calculated using quoted market prices relevant for the term and instrument.
Fair value hierarchy of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, are required to be grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss are the only financial instruments held by the Group at fair value.
th The net liability of 19.5m recognised as at 30 November 2012 2011: 20.1m is categorised as a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt as disclosed in Note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Market risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or the Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates or other market prices.
Interest rate risk is the Group's principal market risk and is considered below.
Interest rate risk management: The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at variable interest rates.
The Group uses a combination of variable rate borrowings and interest rate swaps to manage the risk.
Interest rate sensitivity: The following table details the Group's sensitivity, after tax, to a 1% change in interest rates based on year end levels of debt.

The credit risk on the Group's liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with acceptable generally A and above credit ratings.
Bank deposits are only placed with banks in accordance with Group policy that specifies minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Credit risk on derivatives is closely monitored.
Trade and other receivables consist of amounts due from a large number of parties spread across geographical areas.
The Group does not have any significant concentrations of credit risk as the tenant base is large and diverse with the largest individual tenant accounting for 1.6m 2011: 1.5m of gross rental income.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date.
Included within trade and other receivables is 0.4m 2011: 0.5m which is provided against as it represents estimated irrecoverable amounts.
This allowance has been determined by a review of all significant balances that are past due considering the reason for nonpayment and the creditworthiness of the counterparty.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of bilateral facilities, overdrafts and cash with a range of maturity dates to ensure continuity of funding.
The economic climate continues to provide a difficult backdrop to the Group's operations.
As such, the focus continues to be on managing cash flows and forward commitments, whilst continuing to marshal sites through the planning and remediation process and undertaking development on largely pre-let or pre-sold opportunities.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future cash flows for bank loans and overdrafts is shown in Note 14.

PENSIONS The Group operates a pension scheme with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is closed to new members and future accrual.
The Income Statement includes: a charge of 0.1m 2011: nil for the defined benefit section: and a charge of 0.6m 2011: 0.5m for the defined contribution section.
th The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5 April 2011, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 33.5m, a funding level of 104% based on the Trustees' proposed assumptions for technical provisions these are yet to be finalised.
The valuation was performed using the 'Projected Unit Credit Method' under IAS 19.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3 % pa post-retirement 4.8 % pa Increase in pensions 3.6 % pa th The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30 November 2012 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2012 2011 2010 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.0% 2.4% 2.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment th Pre 6 April 1997 benefits 2.7% 3.0% 3.0% th Post 5 April 1997 benefits 2.7% 3.1% 3.5% Discount rate 4.3% 4.9% 5.5% Inflation assumption 2.0% 2.4% 2.8% Following the closure of the defined benefit section to future accrual, the assumption regarding the rate of increase in salaries is no st longer applicable as retirement benefits will be based on salaries at 31 August 2009.
Benefits earned up to the point of the scheme closure will be protected and will be increased in line with inflation, subject to a maximum of 5% per annum.
From 2010 the basis of the inflation assumption has been amended, in line with market practice, from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
The mortality rates adopted are from the S1 year of birth and medium cohort tables with an underpin to future improvements of 1.5% to reflect the fact that medium cohort improvements will reduce over time.
The resultant assumptions are, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 26.3 years and non-retired members for 28.7 years, based on a normal retirement age of 60.
The Group made a contribution of 0.2m to the defined benefit section of the scheme in 2012 and expects contributions to remain at similar levels in future years.
The fair values of assets in the defined benefit section of the scheme and the expected rates of return, based on market expectations, were: 2012 2011 2010 % m % m % m Equities 4.5 11.0 5.1 9.5 5.7 10.3 Bonds 4.2 9.7 4.8 7.9 5.5 7.6 Property 4.5 6.4 5.1 8.2 5.7 8.5 Cash and other assets 3.2 1.0 4.0 1.5 4.2 0.8 28.1 27.1 27.2 Actuarial value of liabilities 27.0 24.8 24.7 Unrecognised surplus 1.1 2.3 2.5 Surplus in the scheme Related deferred tax liability Fair value of pension asset net of deferred tax The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses before unrecognised surplus of 1.1m recorded in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income is a loss of 0.1m 2011: 0.2m.
