151 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2012 16 Goodwill continued For Process Technologies the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2011 5% and the discount rate was 12.0% 2011 10.1%.
For Catalysts and Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 4.7% 2011 5% and the discount rate was 12.0% 2011 10.1%.
For Macfarlan Smith the long term average growth rate used was 2.5% 2011 2.5% and the discount rate was 8.0% 2011 7.6%.
For Pharmaceutical Materials and Services the long term average growth rate used was 4% 2011 4% and the discount rate was 8.3% 2011 7.4%.
For Research Chemicals the long term average growth rate used was 5% 2011 5% and the discount rate was 9.2% 2011 8.3%.
These impairment tests all result in headroom of over of 100%, except for Macfarlan Smith which is over 80%, and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
