Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Rightmove plc annual report 2012 22 Deferred tax assets continued The Autumn Statement on 5 December 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% by 2014.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will reduce further the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax asset accordingly.
