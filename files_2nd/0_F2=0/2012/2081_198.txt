Petrohawk by means of an all-cash tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of Petrohawk.
The acquisition date of Petrohawk was 20 August 2011.
Petrohawk is an oil and natural gas company based in the United States.
It owns a number of shale gas assets in Texas and Louisiana and associated midstream pipeline systems.
This acquisition provides the Group with operated positions in the resource areas of the Eagle Ford, Haynesville and Permian fields.
Petrohawk was purchased for total consideration of US$12,005 million consisting of US$11,690 million for existing shares and US$315 million for settlement of outstanding options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights collectively referred to as employee awards.
The vesting of the employee awards was accelerated at the acquisition date pursuant to a change of control clause in the original employee award plans.
As a result, all of the consideration for settlement of such awards was included in purchase consideration.
The terms of the acquisition agreement did not include any contingent consideration.
Acquisition related costs of US$46 million have been expensed and included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Details of the business combination are as follows: Provisional fair Adjustments to value reported at provisional Final fair 31 December 2011 fair value value US$M US$M US$M Assets Cash and cash equivalents 10 10 a Trade and other receivables 322 5 327 Other financial assets 240 240 Inventories 59 1 60 b Property, plant and equipment 21,017 5,667 15,350 c Intangibles Goodwill 3,591 3,591 Other assets 68 68 Total assets 21,716 2,070 19,646 Liabilities Trade and other payables 645 4 641 Interest bearing liabilities 3,800 3,800 Other financial liabilities 7 7 Current tax payable 62 5 57 d Deferred tax liabilities 5,049 2,061 2,988 Provisions 88 88 Total liabilities 9,651 2,070 7,581 Net assets 12,065 12,065 less non-controlling interest share of net assets 60 60 Net assets acquired 12,005 12,005 Gross consideration 12,005 12,005 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 10 10 Net consideration paid 11,995 11,995 a The gross contractual amount for trade and other receivables was US$330 million of which US$3 million was not expected to be collected at acquisition date.
b The fair values were provisional at 31 December 2011 due to the complexity of the valuation process, particularly in relation to the valuation of the oil and gas properties and the accounting for the corresponding deferred tax liability.
As a result, the provisional accounting did not separate any goodwill from the value of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent to 31 December 2011, management has obtained a final independent fair valuation of the oil and gas properties and adjusted the provisional value accordingly.
c Goodwill is calculated as a residual amount and the net impact of the above adjustments results in the recognition of goodwill of US$3,591 million.
d The difference between the allocated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired and the corresponding tax base gives rise to a deferred tax liability DTL.
The reduction in the valuation of the oil and gas properties gives rise to a corresponding reduction in the DTL.
The goodwill of US$3,591 million is attributable to the expected synergies to be realised through managing the portfolio of both the acquired assets and the Groups existing assets, and to the measurement of deferred income taxes based on nominal amounts rather than fair value.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The Group has entered into certain retention arrangements with the employees of Petrohawk.
Pursuant to these arrangements, the Group will make retention payments at different intervals, subject to mandatory service requirements, and grant restricted share awards in BHP Billiton Limited with vesting dates ranging from 31 December 2012 to 22 August 2014.
All retention benefits paid to employees will be accounted for as a post-combination employee benefits expense in the Consolidated Income Statement, of which US$56 million has been expensed since the acquisition date.
From the date of the acquisition to 30 June 2012, revenue of US$1,740 million and a loss after taxation of US$136 million were included in the Consolidated Income Statement with regard to Petrohawk.
