Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, issued in January 2009 by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP recommends that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders funds.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2012 would have been 456,000 2011: 541,000.
The notes and financial statements are presented in pounds sterling being the functional currency of the Company and presentational currency for the Company and are rounded to the nearest thousand except where otherwise indicated.
b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on the date the shares are traded.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors at their fair value on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
c Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: realised and unrealised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: special dividends of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: and cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date on which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an accruals basis.
Other investment income, underwriting commission and deposit interest are also recognised on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
34 British Assets Trust plc 1 Accounting policies continued e Traded options The Company may enter into option contracts.
The option contracts are shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair values.
The premiums received and fair value changes in the open positions are normally recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
The costs of closing open option positions are recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where options are written for the maintenance or enhancement of the Companys investments then the changes in fair value are recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
f Deferred taxation Where the year in which tax deductable expenditure is incurred differs from the year in which tax relief for the expenditure is given, the amount of the tax relief is known as deferred tax.
Since the management expenses incurred by the Company in the year under review exceed its profits liable to UK corporation tax see note 6 b, the tax relief attributable to the excess expenses, which can be carried forward to future years, is a deferred tax asset.
However, in accordance with UK GAAP, that deferred tax asset has not been recognised in these accounts since it is unlikely that, in future years, the Company will receive sufficient profits liable to UK corporation tax against which the brought forward expenses can be set-off.
g Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
Other expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which have been allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Interest-bearing borrowings All non-current borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being fair value of the consideration received, net of arrangement costs associated with the borrowings.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective yield basis.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any loan arrangement costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
i Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, have been allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
j Dividends Dividends paid are calculated on an amount per share as approved by the Board of Directors and are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
k Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates on the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement as a revenue or capital item depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

The performance fee arrangement was discontinued on 30 September 2011.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year pro-rated to the date of termination.
Investment management fees have been allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
As reported in the Chairmans Statement on page 4, investment management fees will be allocated 35 per cent to revenue and 65 per cent to capital with effect from 1 October 2012.

The Companys capital is represented by the issued share capital, Capital Redemption Reserve, Capital Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of Ordinary Shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.
Capital reserve Items accounted for this reserve are detailed in accounting policy 1 c. Revenue reserve The net profit arising in the revenue column of the Income Statement is added to this reserve.
Dividends paid during the year are deducted from the reserve and it is available for paying future dividends on the Companys shares.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings, as detailed in notes 11 and 12, the Chairmans Statement and the Managers Review, to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances held.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of financial currency contracts and futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Companys portfolio, and enhancing income.
Listed fixed asset investments held see note 9 are valued at fair value.
For listed securities this is either bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
The market value of the Companys bonds is disclosed on page 44.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet shown on page 32.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movements: ii interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: iii credit risk, being the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: iv liquidity risk, being the risk that the Company may not be able to liquidate its investments quickly enough to meet its ongoing financial commitments: and v foreign currency risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings, investment purchases, investment sales and income will fluctuate because of movements in currency rates.
42 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued The Company held the following categories of financial instruments as at 30 September 2012 and 2011: 2012 2011 000 000 Financial assets Investment portfolio 445,115 413,563 Cash in bank and on deposit 14,486 10,671 Amounts due from brokers 459 422 Payments and accrued income 3,026 2,427 Other debtors 88 96 Financial liabilities 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,500 59,474 Revolving advance facility 19,954 23,151 Amounts due to brokers 690 733 Bond interest payable 207 207 Other creditors 288 321 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The bond portfolio is exposed to movements in price due to fluctuation in interest rates.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in note 9.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific market risk, gain exposure to a specific market or to enhance income.
As at the year end the Company held no material exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed on page 47.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 10 per cent at 30 September 2012, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been a reduction of 44.5 million 2011: 41.4 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 10 per cent at 30 September 2012, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been an increase of 44.5 million 2011: 41.4 million.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments at 30 September 2012 and 2011, all of which are included in the balance sheet at fair value: Classification of financial instruments 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Assets Investment portfolio 445,028 87 445,115 413,342 221 413,563 Foreign exchange currency contracts 46 46 33 33 445,028 46 87 445,161 413,342 33 221 413,530 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Level 1 reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Level 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The Company holds one unquoted investment which is categorised as level 3.
A reconciliation of movements in the year is contained in note 9.
Interest rate risk Floating rate Interest payments are received on cash balances by reference to the bank base rates for the relevant currency for each deposit.

If the bank base rate had decreased by 1.0 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss and net asset value would have been an increase of 55,000 2011: 125,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances and the revolving advance facility as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.
2012 2011 2012 Average 2011 Average Average period Average period 2012 interest until 2011 interest until 000 rate maturity 000 rate maturity Fixed interest investments 51,608 4.9% 9.50 years 53,450 7.00% 9.05 years Fixed interest liabilities: 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,500 6.25% 18.95 years 59,474 6.25% 19.95 years The bonds are denominated in sterling.
In the event that the Company decides to repay the bonds before their maturity date the terms of issue may result in a penalty for early repayment.
The fair value of the bonds, based on the middle market price at 30 September 2012 was 73.9 million 2011: 68.6 million.
44 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 393,507,000 as at 30 September 2012 2011: 360,023,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represents the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2012 2011 000 000 Fixed income securities 51,608 53,540 Cash at bank and on deposit 14,486 10,671 Balances due from brokers 459 422 Interest, dividends and other receivables 3,026 2,427 69,579 67,060 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small due to the short settlement period involved and the diversity of counterparties used.
All the assets of the Company which are traded on a recognised exchange are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports as described in the Report of the Directors on page 26.
The Managers have a monitoring procedure in respect of counterparty risk which is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is controlled through the Managers process for approving counterparties, which incorporates both a quantitative and qualitative review process in order to achieve a substantial overview of the credit worthiness of all counterparties.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such counterparties may cause the Companys ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed, limited or lost.
As at 30 September 2012 the Company had three overnight deposits of 6.4 million, 3.7 million and 2.0 million with three separate counterparties 2011: 6.0 million and 2.8 million with two separate counterparties.
There were no other material concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 30 September 2012 or 30 September 2011 because other deposits were spread over a number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Company maintains sufficient investments in cash and readily realisable securities to pay accounts payable and expenses as they fall due.
