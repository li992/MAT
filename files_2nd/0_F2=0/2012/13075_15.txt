46 2012 Report of the Directors 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS The Executive Committee is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee for the purposes of making strategic decisions and assessing performance.
The Executive Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with the RB Pharmaceuticals in table referred to as RBP and Food businesses being managed separately given the significantly different nature of these businesses and the risks and rewards associated with them.
As a result of the Groups strategy for continued outperformance, announced in February 2012, the geographical segments have changed from those reported in the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 to reflect the Groups increased focus on high growth emerging market clusters.
The new geographical segments comprise Europe and North America ENA : Latin America, North Asia, South East Asia and Australia and New Zealand LAPAC : and Russia and CIS, Middle East, North Africa, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa RUMEA.
Comparative information has been restated on a consistent basis.
The geographical segments derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in the health, hygiene and home categories.
RB Pharmaceuticals derives its revenue exclusively from the sales of buprenorphine-based prescription drugs used to treat opiate dependence and Food derives its revenue from food products sold in ENA.
The results of Schiff Nutrition International, Inc. Schiff subsequent to its acquisition on 14 December 2012 are included in ENA.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue and operating profit before exceptional items.
Finance income and expense are not allocated to segments, as they are managed on a central Group basis.
The Executive Committee do not review inter-segment revenue information, nor is it included in the measure of segment profit or loss reviewed by the Executive Committee.
As such this is no longer included in the Groups operating segments disclosures.
Items of income and expense which are not part of the results and financial position of the operating segments, and therefore reported to the Executive Committee outside of the individual segment financial information, are shown in the Corporate segment.
For the year ended 31 December 2012 this includes profit on disposals of intangible assets and the Paras personal care business, expenses for legal matters, and other corporate provisions with a net effect of 32m.
For the year ended 31 December 2011 this comprised a profit on disposal of intangibles, miscellaneous items and regulatory costs with a net effect of 10m.
Reportable Segments The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2012 is as follows: Total ENA LAPAC RUMEA Food Corporate Ex-RBP RBP Total 2012 m m m m m m m m Net revenue 4,678 2,327 1,404 321 8,730 837 9,567 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment 95 32 8 5 140 8 148 Operating profit before exceptional items 1,156 464 290 92 32 2,034 536 2,570 Exceptional items 135 Operating profit 2,435 Net finance expense 15 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,420 Total ENA LAPAC RUMEA Food Corporate Ex-RBP RBP Total 2011 Restated m m m m m m m m Net revenue 4,837 2,210 1,364 312 8,723 762 9,485 Depreciation, amortisation and impairment 99 30 8 5 142 15 157 Operating profit before exceptional items 1,157 417 293 92 10 1,969 518 2,487 Exceptional items 92 Operating profit 2,395 Net finance expense 19 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,376 2012 47 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The Executive Committee reviews net working capital by segment and other assets and liabilities on a Group basis.

There are a number of unallocated assets and liabilities that comprise corporate items that are not specifically attributable to one segment.
Reconciliation of these assets and liabilities to total assets or liabilities in the balance sheet is shown below: 2012 2011 m m Inventories for reportable segments 865 891 Unallocated: Elimination of profit on inter-company inventory 130 133 Total inventories per the balance sheet 735 758 Trade and other receivables for reportable segments 1,359 1,392 Unallocated: Corporate items 48 50 Total trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 1,407 1,442 Total inventories and trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 2,142 2,200 Other unallocated assets 12,938 11,926 Total assets per the balance sheet 15,080 14,126 Trade and other payables for reportable segments 2,626 2,741 Unallocated: Corporate items 216 160 Total trade and other payables per the balance sheet 2,842 2,901 Other unallocated liabilities 6,316 5,444 Total liabilities per the balance sheet 9,158 8,345 Unallocated assets include goodwill and intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and cash equivalents, while unallocated liabilities include borrowings, deferred tax liabilities and retirement benefit obligations.

Accordingly, the Companys profits for the year ended 31 December 2012 are taxed at an effective rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5%.
UK income tax of 138m 2011: 161m is included within current tax and is calculated at 24.5% 2011: 26.5% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2012 2011 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,420 2,376 Tax at the notional UK corporation tax rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% 593 630 Effects of: Tax at rates other than the UK corporation tax rate 11 9 Adjustments to amounts carried in respect of unresolved tax matters 77 47 Incurrence utilisation of tax losses 7 2 Withholdings and local taxes 16 25 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 58 11 Impact of changes in tax rates 80 65 Exceptional items 8 2 Other permanent differences 13 5 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 587 622 The tax charge is expected to be impacted by items in the nature of those listed above for the foreseeable future.
Following the enactment of legislation in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate to 23% from 1 April 2013, the total tax charge in 2012 includes the impact on the income statement of calculating the UK deferred tax balances at the lower UK corporation tax rate.
The impact of this rate change is a 62m reduction in the tax charge in the income statement.
The proposed future reduction in the UK tax rate to 21% will be reflected when the relevant legislation is substantively enacted.

Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Executive Share Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
The options only dilute earnings when they result in the issue of shares at a value below the market price of the share and when all performance criteria if applicable have been met.
As at 31 December 2012, there were 4m 2011: 4m of Executive Share Options not included within the dilution because the exercise price for the options was greater than the average share price for the year.
The Directors believe that diluted earnings per ordinary share, adjusted for the impact of exceptional items after the appropriate tax amount, provides additional useful information on underlying trends to Shareholders in respect of earnings per ordinary share.

The reclassification of 6m in 2011 relates to the transfer of completed assets from plant and equipment.
Software includes intangible assets under construction of 31m 2011: 22m.
The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and therefore are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
The net book amounts of indefinite and finite life intangible assets are as follows: 2012 2011 Net book amount m m Indefinite life assets: Brands 7,646 7,000 Goodwill 3,324 3,050 Other 36 36 Total indefinite life assets 11,006 10,086 Finite life assets: Brands 25 26 Software 35 27 Other 109 119 Total finite life assets 169 172 Total net book amount of intangible assets 11,175 10,258 Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU for the purposes of impairment testing.
Goodwill is allocated to the CGU, or group of CGUs, that is expected to benefit from the related acquisition.
54 2012 9 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED Cash Generating Units RBs Strategy for Continued Outperformance has fundamentally changed the way the Group operates.
The Group has taken this as an opportunity to reassess the appropriateness of the Groups CGUs under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
After considering all the evidence available, including how brand and production assets generate cash inflows and how management monitors the business, the Directors have concluded that the Groups CGUs with goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets should now be defined as health sexual wellbeing, health other, hygiene, home, Food and portfolio brands.
Previously the CGUs were defined as the Groups product groups health & personal care, fabric care, surface care, home care, dishwashing, Food, and other.
The acquired Schiff business is treated as its own CGU in 2012 called health VMS.
This will be reassessed following integration into the Groups operations in 2013.
An analysis of the net book amount of indefinite life assets and goodwill by CGU is shown below: 2012 2011 restated Indefinite Indefinite life assets Goodwill Total life assets Goodwill Total CGU Key brands m m m m m m Health sexual wellbeing Durex 1,952 976 2,928 1,909 988 2,897 Health other Gaviscon, Mucinex, Nurofen, Scholl, Strepsils 2,926 1,783 4,709 3,017 1,843 4,860 Health VMS Airborne, MegaRed, Move Free 811 374 1,185 Hygiene Bang, Clearasil, Dettol, Finish, Harpic, Lysol, Mortein, Veet 1,176 149 1,325 1,232 157 1,389 Home Air Wick, Calgon, Vanish, Woolite 786 42 828 807 45 852 Portfolio Brands 39 17 56 Food Frenchs 31 31 32 32 7,682 3,324 11,006 7,036 3,050 10,086 Restated for changes in CGUs described above.
Indefinite life assets allocated to the Food CGU are not considered significant relative to the Groups total indefinite life assets.
As such the disclosures below do not include discussion on the assumptions specific to Food.
On acquisition the indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill of health VMS were provisionally valued at fair value.
Subsequent to acquisition there has been no evidence that this fair value is impaired.
The key assumptions applied in determining these fair values are summarised in the table below.
Value in use and key assumptions The annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives is based on an assessment of each CGUs value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections, based on historical operating results and short-term budgets and medium-term business plans approved by management covering a four-year period.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from restructuring not yet implemented.
Cash flows beyond the four-year period are extrapolated using the estimated long-term growth rates stated below.
Individual long-term growth rates are applied to each product type within a CGU, and as such ranges are provided in some cases below.
The long-term growth rates applied do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market and countries in which the CGU operates.
Management has assessed the appropriate discount rate for each individual CGU, using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC for comparable companies operating in similar markets and geographies as the Group as the base discount rate, adjusted for risks specific to each CGU.
Due to the similar geographic and product diversification of their respective markets and risks associated with each CGU, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% was determined for each of the health sexual wellbeing, health other, hygiene and home CGUs 2011: 11%.
Health VMS is predominantly concentrated in one market, being the US, and a blended pre-tax discount rate of 14% was applied in the provisional fair value exercise, reflecting the increased risk associated with this CGU from its market concentration and the fact that this is a new business to the Group.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, revenue growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
The cash flow projections also take account of the expected impact from new product initiatives, efficiency initiatives and the maturity of the markets in which each CGU operates.
These key assumptions are based on past performance and our experience of volumes, growth rates and prices in our key markets.
Discount CGU Growth % rate % Health sexual wellbeing 4 11 Health other 0-4 11 Health VMS 2 14 Hygiene 0-4 11 Home 0-2 11 Impairment Review In October 2012 an impairment review was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, including goodwill.
This review was updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between October and December.
No impairment was considered necessary.
Any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amounts of the health other, hygiene and home CGUs is based would not cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
With a recoverable amount exceeding its carrying value by 388m, the heath sexual wellbeing CGU is the most sensitive to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions.
This is expected of a recent acquisition where the acquired intangible assets were valued at fair value.
Increasing the pre-tax discount rate from 11% to 12%, or halving the short-term revenue growth expectations in the management approved shortand medium-term budgets, or reducing the long-term terminal growth rate from 4% to 3% would be required to reduce the recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

Certain deferred tax assets in respect of overseas corporation tax losses and other temporary differences totalling 152m 2011: 115m have not been recognised at 31 December 2012 as the likelihood of future economic benefit is not sufficiently assured.
These assets will be recognised if utilisation of the losses and other temporary differences becomes reasonably certain.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.

Financial Risk Management The Groups multinational operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk, market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that uses foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into Group Treasury GT to achieve benefits of scale and control.
GT manages financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
GT manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of Treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
GT operates under the close control of the CFO and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market Risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with GT to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
GT matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2012 was 4,303m payable 2011: 3,175m payable.

The same was true as at 31 December 2011.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in Australian dollars, Euro, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars and Hungarian forint.
Notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Australian dollar 90 47 Euro 90 12 Canadian dollar 60 40 Singapore dollar 43 - Hungarian forint 38 - New Zealand dollar 12 11 Swedish krona 4 13 US dollars 1 14 Polish zloty 53 Other 1 4 339 194 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature over the period January 2013 to January 2014 2011: January 2012 to December 2012.
There is no ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges 2011: nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2012 of 3m gain 2011: 3m gain are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship, with all others held constant, does not have a significant effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity.
A fluctuation analysis has been performed for all currencies.
The largest potential fluctuation would be in respect of forward contracts between the Australian dollar and the Singapore dollar.
If the Singapore dollar had strengthened weakened by 5% against the Australian dollar, with all other variables held constant, the impact on Shareholders equity would have been less than 1m 2011: nil.
As at 31 December 2012 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 5% against Sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an insignificant effect on the income statement or Shareholders equity 2011: insignificant.
The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non-interest bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
The gains and losses from fair value movements on financing derivatives recognised in finance income and expense were nil 2011: nil.
b Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk.
Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods, such as oil related, and a diverse range of other, raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group monitors its interest expense rate exposure on a regular basis.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre-tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the income statement of a 50 basis-point shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 9m 2011: 10m or decrease of 9m 2011: 10m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 13.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The Group uses BBB and higher rated counterparties to manage risk and uses BBB rated counterparties by exception.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the Board approved policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
2012 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 14 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating lower of S&P and Moodys and balances cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity Risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the local business units and aggregated by GT.
GT monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the overseas businesses are generally remitted to GT.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2012, the Group had, in addition to its long-term debt of 3m 2011: 3m, committed borrowing facilities totalling 4,000m 2011: 3,600m, of which 3,600m exceeded 12 months maturity.
Of the total facilities at the year end, nil 2011: nil was utilised.
The committed borrowing facilities, together with available uncommitted facilities and central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at the balance sheet date, were as follows: 2012 2011 m m Undrawn committed borrowing facilities: Expiring within one year 400 Expiring between one and two years 850 850 Expiring after more than two years 2,750 2,750 4,000 3,600 All borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest.
The facilities have been arranged to cover general corporate purposes including support for commercial paper issuance.
All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
Headroom between net debt and available facilities at 31 December 2012 was 1,574m 2011: 1,805m.
The Groups borrowing limit at 31 December 2012 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 60,468m 2011: 59,823m.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and the derivatives which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Capital Management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term available for sale financial assets and financing derivative financial instruments refer to note 16.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
2012 2011 m m Net debt note 16 2,426 1,795 Total equity 5,922 5,781 8,348 7,576 The objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In maintaining an appropriate capital structure and providing returns for Shareholders, the Company provided returns to Shareholders in 2012 in the form of dividends and the buy back of shares.
Refer to notes 27 and 22 respectively.
The Group monitors net debt and at year end the Group had net debt of 2,426m 2011: 1,795m.
The Group seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.

19 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities comprising guarantees relating to subsidiary undertakings, at 31 December 2012 amounted to 3m 2011: 4m.
The Group is involved in a number of investigations by government authorities and has made provisions for such investigations, where appropriate.
Where it is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters, the Directors have made no provision for such potential liabilities.
The Group has received a civil claim for damages from the Department of Health and others in the UK regarding alleged anti-competitive activity involving the Gaviscon brand.
The claim is under review and although it is at an early stage, the Directors do not believe that any potential impact would be material to the Group financial statements.
The Group from time to time is involved in disputes in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
Where appropriate, the Directors make provisions based on their assessment of each case.

The Groups most significant defined benefit pension scheme UK is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US Retiree Health Care Scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2012 there were 2,691 2011: 2,584 eligible retirees and 1,193 2011: 1,312 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Defined contribution schemes 25 26 Defined benefit schemes net charge 25 25 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement note 5 50 51 For the largest UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2010 and updated at 31 December 2012.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2012 and updated at 31 December 2012.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the two major schemes as at 31 December 2012 were: 2012 2011 US US UK medical UK medical % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.5 4.6 Rate of increase in deferred pensions during deferment 2.9 3.1 Rate of increase in pension payments pensioners 2.7 3.1 Rate of increase in pension payments non-pensioners 2.7 3.1 Discount rate 4.3 4.1 4.8 4.7 Inflation assumption 3.0 3.1 Annual medical cost inflation 5.09.0 5.09.0 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 7.0 8.1 Bonds 4.3 4.8 Other 5.7 6.6 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables: the average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2012 2011 years years Male 28.2 28.0 Female 30.1 29.8 For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the standard SAPS mortality table 1NMA for males and 1NFA for females.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60, 15 years after the balance sheet date, is as follows: 2012 2011 years years Male 30.0 29.8 Female 31.9 31.7 For the US scheme the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 combined table.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 60 on the balance sheet date is 24.1 years 2011: 24.0 years for males and 25.8 years 2011: 25.8 years for females.

2012 69 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group operates a number of incentive schemes, including a share option scheme, a restricted share scheme, and other share award schemes.
All schemes are equity settled.
The charge for share-based payments for the year was 49m 2011: 61m.
Executive Share Awards Share options and restricted shares Executive Share Awards are awarded to the Top400 Management Group.
Executive share awards have a contractual life of 10 years but vest according to the following compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over a three-year period: Earnings per share CAAG growth over % of options and per year % three years % shares vesting 9 29.5 100 8 26.0 80 7 22.5 60 6 19.1 40 The cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
For Executive Committee and Top40 members vesting conditions are not retested.
For remaining Top400 members the targets can be retested over four or five years.
If any target has not been met any remaining shares or options which have not vested will lapse.
Other Share Awards Other share awards represent SAYE Schemes offered to all staff within the relevant geographic area and a number of Senior Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Other share awards have contractual lives of three to seven years and are generally not subject to any vesting criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Individual tranches of these other share awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the tables below.
All outstanding Executive and Other share awards as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2012 and 2011.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2012 that could have been exercised at that date were 5,672,533 2011: 5,617,828 with a weighted average exercise price of 26.08 2011: 24.42.
2012 71 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the plans, early exercise may only be granted in exceptional circumstances and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the plans in 2012 or 2011 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
