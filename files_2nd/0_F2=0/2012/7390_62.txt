DEFERRED TAX The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting year.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been appropriately offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: As at 31 December 2012 2011 $000 $000 Deferred tax liabilities 22,921 23,147 Deferred tax assets 45,772 36,072 22,851 12,925 No deferred tax asset has been recognised on temporary differences totalling $33,310, 000 2011: $64,514,000 due to the unpredictability of the related future profit streams.
Of these temporary differences, $8,681,000 relate to unrecognised deferred tax on UK share-based payments.
The remaining temporary differences of $24,629,000 relate to losses on which no deferred tax is recognised.
Of these losses $1,321,000 relate to losses that have expired by 31 December 2012.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of $57,933,000 2011: $39,201,000 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
