BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued g Capital management continued There are no provisions of the Companies Laws 1998 which confer rights of pre-emption in respect of the allotment of Shares.
There are, however, pre-emption rights contained in the Articles, but the Directors have been granted the power to issue 500 million further Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis for a period concluding on 31 December 2013, unless such power is previously revoked by the Companys Shareholders in a general meeting pursuant to section 199 of the 2008 Law by a special resolution of Shareholders passed on 3 August 2012.
The Directors intend to request that the authority to allot Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis is renewed at each subsequent general meeting of the Company.
Unless authorised by Shareholders, the Company will not issue further Ordinary Shares or re-issue Ordinary Shares out of treasury for cash at a price below the prevailing net asset value per share unless they are first offered pro-rata to existing shareholders.
The Company monitors capital on the basis of the carrying amount of reserves as presented on the face of the Statement of Financial Position.
Capital for the reporting year under review is summarised as follows: 2012 2011 GBP GBP Purchase of own shares 30,453,679 483,079 Distributable reserves 988,759,405 935,497,683 Total 958,305,726 935,014,604 16 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The continuation vote mechanism was triggered for the Sterling Shares and US Dollar Shares as announced on 31 January 2013 and for the Euro Shares as announced on 28 February 2013.
Continuation resolutions were passed for Sterling and Euro Share classes of Ordinary Shares at separate Class meetings held on 17 April 2013 and accordingly no further continuation vote could be triggered for each class until 31 December 2013 Sterling Shares and 31 January 2014 Euro Shares.
The Continuation resolution was not passed for the US Dollar Share class and therefore the Directors will formulate redemption proposals to be put to the shareholders of that class only prior to 17 July 2013 offering to redeem their shares at the relevant Net Asset Value less the costs of all such redemptions.
With effect from 17 April 2013 the Board has suspended all future conversions of Euro and Sterling shares into US Dollar shares pending conclusion of the aforementioned redemption offer for US Dollar shares.
