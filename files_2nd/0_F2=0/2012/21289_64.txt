17 Risk management policies and procedures for the Group and Company As an investment trust the Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on the inside front cover and in the business review.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks comprising market price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit and counterparty risk, and the directors approach to the management of these risks, are set out below.
The Board of directors and the Manager coordinate the Groups risk management.
The Board determines the objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and these are set out below under the relevant risk category.
The policies for the management of risk have not changed from the previous accounting period.
17.1 Market risk The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
1 Market price risk Market price risk ie changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the fair value of the quoted and unquoted investments.
Management of the risk The Board of directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely reporting of relevant information from the Manager.
Investment performance is reviewed at each Board meeting.
The Board monitors the Managers compliance with the Groups objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation, including as between countries and economies.
The Groups exposure to changes in market prices on its investments was as follows: 31 October 31 October 2012 2011 000 000 Equities 546,736 512,159 Fixed interest 83 98 546,819 512,257 There are no material differences between Group and Company exposure to market price risk.

1 Market price risk continued Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the Groups net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2011: 20% in the fair values of the Groups equity investments at each balance sheet date.
This level of change is considered to be reasonable based on observation of current market conditions.

2 Currency risk A significant proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency and presentational currency.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a regular basis and reports to the Board at each Board meeting.
The Manager measures the risk to the Group of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Groups net asset value and total return of a movement in the exchange rate to which the Groups assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings may be used to limit the Groups exposure to future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
These borrowings are limited to 30% of the adjusted net asset value.
Investment income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group did not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
During the year, derivative contracts were not used to hedge against exposure to currency risk.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Groups monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31 October are shown overleaf.
Where the Groups equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

There are no material differences between Group and Companys exposure to foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency sensitivity The table overleaf illustrates the sensitivity of the total profit after tax for the year and the net assets in regard to movements in the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities caused by changes in the exchange rates for the US Dollar Sterling, Euro Sterling, Japanese Yen Sterling and Hong Kong Dollar Sterling.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: US Dollar Sterling - 10% 2011: 10%.
These percentages are deemed reasonable based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial assets and financial liabilities held at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

2 Currency risk continued The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of a depreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2012 2011 US Japanese Hong Kong US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 326 126 112 85 180 147 95 78 Capital return 15,286 3,676 5,090 2,645 12,694 3,918 5,171 2,198 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 15,612 3,802 5,202 2,730 12,874 4,065 5,266 2,276 The impact on the total profit after tax and the year end net assets of an appreciation of 10% in the year end exchange rate for Sterling against the currencies shown would have been as follows: 2012 2011 US Japanese Hong Kong US Japanese Hong Kong $ Euro Yen $ $ Euro Yen $ 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 266 103 92 70 148 121 79 64 Capital return 12,507 3,008 4,165 2,164 10,386 3,206 4,231 1,798 Change to profit after tax for the year and net assets 12,773 3,111 4,257 2,234 10,534 3,327 4,310 1,862 In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Groups objectives.
3 Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable from cash at bank, the current asset investment and the value of the xed interest investments.
Management of the risk The Group nances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.1.
3 Interest rate risk continued Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 October of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown below.
For oating interest rates exposure is by reference to when the interest rate is due to be re-set.
2012 2011 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to oating interest rates: Cash at bank 3,126 3,126 6,360 6,360 Current asset investment 1,301 1,301 3,650 3,650 Exposure to xed interest rates: Fixed interest investments 83 83 98 98 Bank loans 1,000 1,000 Debentures 25,000 25,000 25,000 25,000 3,427 24,917 21,490 10,010 24,902 14,892 The above amounts are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made, and borrowings are drawn down and repaid.
There are no material differences between Group and Companys exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts, is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2011: same.
Interest paid on debentures is set out in note 16.
Interest rate sensitivity The Group is primarily exposed to interest rate risk through its cash balances, its current asset investment and its xed income investment portfolio.
The sensitivity of each exposure is as follows: Cash Cash balances vary throughout the year.
Cash balances at the year end were 3,126,000 2011: 6,360,000 and if that level of cash was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in LIBOR up or down would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 31,000 2011: 64,000.
Current asset investment sensitivity The Companys interest bearing current asset investment at the year end was 1,301,000 2011: 3,650,000 and if that level of investment was maintained for a full year, then a 100 basis points change in interest rates up or down, would increase or decrease total net return on ordinary activities after taxation by approximately 13,000 2011: 37,000.
Fixed income investment sensitivity The Companys xed income portfolio at the year end was valued at 83,000 2011: 98,000, and is not currently paying interest and therefore there is no modied duration interest rate sensitivity 2011: no modied duration.
17.2 Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
54 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.2 Liquidity risk continued Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has a multi-currency loan facility of 30,000,000 with Commonwealth Bank of Australia 2011: 20,000,000 and an overdraft facility with the custodian, the extent of which is determined by the custodian on a regular basis by reference to the value of the securities held by it on behalf of the Company.
The facilities are subject to regular review.
The Group also has two debentures, details of which can be found in note 16 on page 49.
The Board gives guidance to the Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should generally remain fully invested and that shortterm borrowings be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 October, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required was as follows: 2012 2011 Due between Due between Due within three months Due after Due within three months Due after three months and one year one year three months and one year one year 000 000 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 2,250 40,150 2,250 42,400 Bank loans 1,001 Other creditors and accruals 1,078 3,564 2,079 2,250 40,150 3,564 2,250 42,400 There are no material differences between the Group and Companys exposure to liquidity risk.
17.3 Credit and counterparty risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Group suffering a loss.
Management of the risk Credit risk is managed as follows: transactions involving derivatives are entered into only with investment banks, the credit rating of which is taken into account so as to minimise the risk to the Group of default.
investment transactions are carried out with a large number of approved brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
cash at bank is held only with reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings and is subject to continual review.
Stock lending transactions are carried out with a number of approved counterparties, whose credit-standard is reviewed by the Manager and limits are set on the amount that may be lent to any one counterparty.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.3 Credit and counterparty risk continued Stock lending is the temporary transfer of securities by a lender to a borrower, with an agreement by the borrower to return equivalent securities to the lender at an agreed future date.
Stock lending revenue is received for making the investments available to the borrower which increases the returns on the portfolio.
In all cases securities lent continue to be recognised on the balance sheet.
Details of the value of the securities on loan at the year end, and the collateral held can be found in note 4 on page 43.
Other than stock lending transactions, none of the Groups financial assets or liabilities is secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Group through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Group only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed periodically by the Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Groups rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Groups cash balances are held by our custodian, BNP Paribas Securities Services.
The directors believe the counterparty is of high credit quality, therefore the Group has minimal exposure to credit risk.
Credit risk exposure The table below summarises the maximum credit risk exposure of the Group as at year end: 2012 2011 000 000 Fixed interest securities 83 98 Cash 3,126 6,360 Receivables: Securities sold for future settlement 150 1,329 3,359 7,787 There are no material differences between the Group and Companys exposure to credit risk.
17.4 Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
The par value of the debenture stocks can be found in note 16.
The fair values are calculated using prices quoted on the exchange on which the instruments trade.
17.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table overleaf sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: 56 The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.5 Fair value hierarchy disclosures continued Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The table below sets out the fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
There have been no transfers during the year between any of the levels.
A reconciliation of fair value movements within Level 3 is set out below.
2012 2011 Level 3 investments at fair value Group Company Group Company through profit or loss 000 000 000 000 Opening balance 98 1,285 118 1,103 Disposal proceeds 45 1,231 48 48 Total gains included in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on assets held at year end 30 125 28 230 83 179 98 1,285 The total value of unquoted investments as at 31 October 2012 for the Group was 83,000 2011: 98,000.
The total value of unquoted investments as at 31 October 2012 for the Company was 179,000 2011: 1,285,000.
The Bankers Investment Trust PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 57 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 17 Risk management policies and procedures continued 17.6 Capital management policies and procedures The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern, and to generate total return to its equity shareholders in accordance with its objectives through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The portfolio includes unquoted investments which represent less than 0.02% 2011: 0.02% of the total portfolio and which are held at directors fair valuations.
The Groups capital at 31 October 2012 comprises its equity share capital, reserves and debt that are shown in the balance sheet at a total of 552,214,000 2011: 521,331,000.
The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Groups capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium : the need for new issues of equity shares: the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
The Companys policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: under the multi-currency facility total borrowings not to exceed 30% of net asset value and net asset value not to fall below 150,000,000.
These are measured in accordance with the policies used in the annual financial statements.
as a public company, the Company has a minimum share capital of 50,000. in order to be able to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividends, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by law.
the terms of the debenture trust deeds have various covenants which prescribe that moneys borrowed should not exceed 20% to 100% of the adjusted total of capital and reserves as dened in the debenture trust deeds.
These requirements are unchanged since last year, and the Company has complied with them throughout the year.
