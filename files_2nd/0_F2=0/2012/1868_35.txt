131 Shareholder Information The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The future estimated cash flows are based on board approved forecasts and are adjusted to reflect the individual risk of the CGU.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and our view of our ability to outperform them.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The key assumptions in constructing the 2013-2015 plans were that: Signature, ASIG and Engine Repair and Overhaul will see gradual recovery throughout the plan period with ongoing operational improvements: Legacy Support will experience modest revenue growth: and APPH will experience gradual recovery complimented by continued operational improvement.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years.
In order to reflect the key potential downside risk to these forecasts, the model is adjusted to reflect a more pessimistic view of the rate of market recovery than used for budget and planning purposes.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts over the long-term business cycle and assume a growth rate of 2.4% 2011: 2.3%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.8% 2011: 10.3% and this approximates to the Groups weighted average pre-tax cost of capital which is deemed applicable for all CGUs.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate and growth rate.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would result in the value in use exceeding the recoverable amount for any of the CGUs.
Consolidated Financial Statements 95 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 9.
Where assets have been written down or impaired the recoverable amount has been determined by reference to its value in use, estimated using the forecast cash flows over the remaining life of the asset and discounted using a rate of 10.8% 2011: 10.3% which approximates to the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The amounts disclosed above for asset write downs are attributable to $3.7 million in Flight Support, $3.1 million in Aftermarket Services and $0.3 million unallocated corporate.

The interest rate swaps detailed above as fair value through profit and loss are designated in formal hedging relationships and are used to hedge the change in fair value of fixed rate US dollar borrowings.
Recoveries from third parties in respect of environmental and other liabilities totalling $21.2 million 2011: $19.7 million are included within loans and receivables.
Derivative Financial Instruments The fair values of all derivative financial instruments shown in the table below are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments detailed in the table below are based on the contractual gross amounts as at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as confirmation that the fair values have been calculated based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group does not have any derivative financial instruments which would be categorised as level 1 or level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

This company is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group and premiums paid are held to meet future claims.
The cash balances held by the company are reported on the balance sheet within cash and cash equivalents.
As is usual practice for captive insurance companies some of this cash is used as collateral against contingent liabilities standby letters of credit that have been provided to certain external insurance companies.

The amounts pledged are usually for less than one year and are secured by a legal charge, to the bank providing the letters of credit, over the cash balances of BBA Aviation Insurances Limited corresponding to the amount of the standby letters of credit.
Consolidated Financial Statements 103 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 17.
Derivative financial instruments continued Financial Risk Factors Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise potential financial risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with our subsidiaries.
The treasury policies cover specific areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
These policies are outlined on page 52.
Capital Risk Management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times based on EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
Market Risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the use of derivative financial instruments.
i Foreign Exchange Risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets which are principally denominated in US dollars.
As at 31 December 2012 the majority of the Groups net borrowings were denominated in US dollars as detailed in the table below: 2012 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 117.0 8.5 19.7 5.9 151.1 Borrowings and finance leases 583.7 1.4 8.3 1.3 594.7 Derivative asset fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings 27.2 27.2 Net debt 439.5 7.1 11.4 4.6 416.4 2011 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 90.0 12.9 19.6 2.6 125.1 Borrowings and finance leases 533.8 1.8 10.6 1.6 547.8 Derivative asset fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings 19.1 19.1 Net debt 424.7 11.1 9.0 1.0 403.6 Consolidated Financial Statements 104 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 77 Independent Auditors Report to the members of BBA Aviation plc 17.

80 Consolidated Balance Sheet The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect 81 Consolidated Cash Flow is to show the $300 million US private placement at face value to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.
Statement At the end of 2012 the Group had outstanding $125 million 2011: $200 million and nil million 2011: 50 million of cross-currency 82 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity swaps.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as net investment hedges at the 2012 year end amounting 83 Accounting Policies of theGroup to a payable of $21.8 million 2011: payable $41.5 million has been recognised within other comprehensive income.
88 Notes to the Consolidated The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign Financial Statements exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each 121 Independent Auditors Report to foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency the members of BBA Aviation plc risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and 122 Company Balance Sheet where significant foreign currency exposures exist then we generally will also cover a percentage of the projected foreign currency 123 Accounting Policies of flows depending on the certainty of these cash flows.
theCompany The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting monthly reports to Group Treasury which detail 124 Notes to the Company Financial Statements the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant 129 Principal Subsidiary and foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of Associated Undertakings the policy.
The pre-determined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure 130 Five Year Summary which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury 131 Shareholder Information on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with our relationship banks.

A gain of $0.8 million 2011: loss $2.4 million has been transferred to the income statement.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $10.7 million 2011: $1.1 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
The net impact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite effect on administrative expenses.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.
During 2011 the Board reviewed and updated the Groups interest rate risk policy addressing the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, in order to protect the interest cover covenant.

A charge of $10.3 million 2011: charge $9.4 million has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
The Group has designated $300 million interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and the fair value gain of $27.2 million 2011: $19.1million has been booked to the income statement.
This amount is off-set against the change in fair value on the fixed rate debt, which has also been booked to the income statement, so that the net impact is immaterial.
Credit Risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets that we have and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
During the year cross-currency swaps of 50 million and $75 million were closed out at a cash cost of $4.4 million and $6.5 million respectively.
In addition the Group closed out two interest rate swaps totalling $100 million at a cost of $3.8 million.

Derivative financial instruments continued 78 Consolidated Income Statement Treasury related credit risk 79 Consolidated Statement of The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties with investment grade ratings, as measured by financial Comprehensive Income credit rating agencies.
All treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities 80 Consolidated Balance Sheet to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively, bank 81 Consolidated Cash Flow accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Statement Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned 82 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash 83 Accounting Policies of theGroup and derivatives that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
88 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These 121 Independent Auditors Report to exposures are continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury the members of BBA Aviation plc management activity.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
122 Company Balance Sheet 123 Accounting Policies of Commercial related credit risk theCompany The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts 124 Notes to the Company Financial Statements presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled by a number of different ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case- 129 Principal Subsidiary and Associated Undertakings by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that 130 Five Year Summary have not been provided for as shown in note 12.
131 Shareholder Information Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of banks to mitigate this risk further.
Headroom on our facilities is regularly evaluated and consistently monitored to ensure that the Group has adequate headroom and liquidity.
The Groups committed facilities are a $250 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2014 and a $500 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2016.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2012 and 2011 respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to cash flow interest rate derivatives.
Cash and floating rate debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
Fixed rate debt is also carried at amortised cost unless fair value interest rate hedges are entered into and hedge accounting achieved whereby the fixed rate debt is fair valued through the income statement to offset the movement in fair value of the swaps: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully in comprehensive income: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rates affects a full 12 month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances at the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumed this is the position for a full 12 month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used due to the fact that historically floating US dollar interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was $11.3 million 2011: $10.9 million of which $6.3 million 2011: $6.2million was in respect of schemes outside of the United Kingdom.
This includes $8.0 million 2011: $7.8 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been no new tranches purchased during 2012.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The IPP was closed to new members in 2002.
On 1 March 2010, the future service benefits provided by this plan were changed from a final salary to a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis.
At the same time, benefits accrued in the IPP prior to 1 March 2010 were changed so that these now increase in line with inflation rather than future salary increases.
The latest actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out as at 31 March 2009.
Following this valuation the Company agreed to pay additional contributions of 3.75 million $6.1 million per annum from 2011 to 2012 and 4.75 million $7.7 million in each of the years 2013 and 2014 to repair the funding shortfall of 30.8 million $49.9 million calculated at that date.
The Groups foreign pension schemes all in North America mainly relate to a funded defined benefit pension arrangement.
There is also a post-retirement medical plan and a deferred compensation plan.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2012.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 Per annum % Discount rate 4.0 4.6 5.4 3.7 4.4 5.2 Rate of increase to pensionable salaries 3.1 3.3 3.7 4.0 4.0 4.0 Price inflation 2.6 2.8 3.2 2.3 2.3 2.2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.6 2.7 3.1 2.3 For the UK plan, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the UK plan as at 31 December 2012 are as follows: 2012 2011 Male Female Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65 year old years 21.9 22.8 21.8 22.8 Life expectancy for a 65 year old in 15 years years 24.2 25.5 24.0 25.4 For the US post-retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 7.5% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 5.0% in 2018 onwards.

Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
131 Shareholder Information 2 In accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14 a minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements are such that future contributions in respect of past service will result in an unrecognisable surplus in future.
The funding policy for the United Kingdom and majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are $4.2 million 2011: $4.5 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the deferred compensation plan in North America.
These amounts are not included within the assets shown in the table above as they are not controlled by the plan in question.
A 0.25% increase in the assumed discount rate for the UK plan would decrease the net deficit before impact of IFRIC 14 and the minimum funding liability by approximately $16.6 million.
A 0.25% decrease in the assumed discount rate for the UK plan would increase the net deficit before impact of IFRIC 14 and the minimum funding liability by approximately $17.8 million.
A 0.25% increase in the assumed future inflation rate for the UK plan would increase the net deficit before impact of IFRIC 14 and the minimum funding liability by approximately $16.2 million.
A 0.25% decrease in the assumed future inflation rate for the UK plan would decrease the net deficit before impact of IFRIC 14 and the minimum funding liability by approximately $16.8 million.

The long-term rates of return on bonds and other investments are set in line with market yields available at the balance sheet date.
In the UK, the long-term rate of return on equities is derived from considering current risk free rates of return with the addition of a future risk premium.
The overall expected return on assets in the analysis of the income statement is based on weighted average returns using the above rates for each asset class, and taking into account the asset allocation in each plan.

Settlement losses have been recognised within other operating expenses.
In June 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 revised.
The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
IAS 19 revised must be applied retrospectively.
The principal impact for the Group will be that the concepts of expected return on assets and interest expense on the defined benefit obligation as separate components of defined benefit cost will be replaced by a concept that interest will be calculated on the net of the defined benefit obligation, after allowance for any asset ceilings and additional liability under IFRIC 14, using an interest rate reflecting market yields of high quality corporate bonds in a deep market.
If this concept had been adopted by the Group in 2012, it is estimated that underlying profit before tax would have been $5.2 million lower and adjusted basic EPS 1.1 cents per share lower.
As required by the standard, the Group will retrospectively adopt the standard on 1 January 2013.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2012 had weighted average remaining contractual life of 24 months, and an exercise price range of 0.57 to 2.99.
Options over 2,182,641 shares were granted under the BBA UK Share Option Plan and the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, in the year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted and calculated using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The inputs into the models were as follows: Issued in December Issued in 2012 March 2011 Weighted average share price pence 212 210 Weighted average exercise price pence 156 163 Expected volatility 47.2% Expected life months 36 36 Risk-free rate 1.8% Expected dividends 3.9% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the period of time equivalent to the remaining contractual life of the option.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

iii Expense charged to income statement The Group recognised total expenses of $0.9 million 2011: $5.6 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
iv Cash-settled share-based payments The Group issues to certain employees share appreciation rights SARs that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the SAR to the employee at the date of exercise.
The fair value of the SARs is determined by using the valuation technique most appropriate to each type of award.
These include the Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations and use the assumptions noted in the above table.
The Group has recorded liabilities of $0.1 million 2011: $0.6 million and a total charge of $0.7 million 2011: $0.2 million.

Consolidated Financial Statements 119 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.
Acquisition and disposal of businesses continued The fair value of the net assets acquired and goodwill arising on these acquisitions are set out below: Signature Engine Flight Repair and Support ASIG Overhaul Total 2012 2012 2012 2012 $m $m $m $m Intangible assets 0.4 4.8 5.2 Property, plant and equipment 1.7 3.6 1.1 6.4 Inventories 0.2 0.2 0.8 1.2 Receivables 2.1 2.1 Payables 2.3 2.3 Net assets 2.3 8.4 1.9 12.6 Goodwill 3.9 18.6 22.5 Total consideration 6.2 27.0 1.9 35.1 Satisfied by: Cash consideration 6.2 27.0 1.9 35.1 The fair values in respect of the ASIG acquisition are provisional and are subject to possible amendment on finalisation of the fair value exercise due to the proximity to the year end.
Acquisition-related costs, included within other operating expenses, amount to $1.5 million.
The goodwill arising on all these acquisitions is attributable to the anticipated profitability arising from the growth of the Signature and ASIG networks, expansion of the Groups Commercial and Engine Repair and Overhaul businesses, together with anticipated future operating synergies.
$17.9 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
In the period since acquisition, the operations acquired have contributed $36.0 million and $2.5 million to revenue and operating profit respectively.
If all the acquisitions had occurred on the first day of the financial year, the total revenue and operating profit from these acquisitions is estimated to be $48.8 million and $3.8 million respectively.
There have been no disposals during the year.
Contingent liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business, including specific product liability and environmental claims.
Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos-related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2012, BBAs aggregate costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos-related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately $16.0 million.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims.
Whilst the outcome of these claims are, by their nature, uncertain, the directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will materially exceed the insurance coverage or amounts provided as shown in note 18, and are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
