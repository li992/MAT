Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 28 February 2013.
Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions EU IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The Company has elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards.
These are presented on pages 118 to 135 and the accounting policies in respect of the Company are set out on pages 119 to 122.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except unless otherwise indicated.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRSs.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below and the accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.
New accounting standards The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time in the current period and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS IAS 12 Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax Recovery of Underlying Assets IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for Firsttime Adopters IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cashgenerating units monitored by management.
Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
75 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cashgenerating unit, an operation within a cashgenerating unit, an associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identifiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably, or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Product development Research expenditure is recognised in the year in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets are met.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 no amounts have met the recognition criteria.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets Intangible assets with finite useful lives and property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment at each reporting date where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are assessed at least annually.
When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected cash flows value in use of the relevant cashgenerating unit or asset and the fair value less cost to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
76 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Where an impairment loss has been recognised against an asset, it may be reversed in future periods where there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised, but only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
Such a reversal is recognised in the income statement.
This does not apply for goodwill, for which an impairment loss must not be reversed in any circumstances.
Leases Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, after provisions for obsolescence.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a firstinfirstout basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, for which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into US dollars using average rates for the period.
The exchange differences arising on retranslation are classified as a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs, being 1 January 2003.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are noninterest bearing and are stated at original invoiced amount less an appropriate allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Such allowances are based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer exposures.
77 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits which usually have an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
There are no bank overdrafts.
Trade payables Trade payables are noninterest bearing and are stated at the original invoiced amount.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Group are classified in equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and included as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such treasury shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Group has not adopted the hedge accounting rules ever since the decision was taken to change the reporting currency in 2010.
Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Retirement benefits The Group operates two funded defined benefit pension plans which are in the United Kingdom, all other pension plans are defined contribution in nature.
For the defined contribution plans the amount charged to the income statement is the employers contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement as finance costs or finance income.
78 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover, by way of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specific contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulfils its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Sharebased payment The Group operates various equitysettled sharebased compensation plans and accounts for these awards in accordance with IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment.
The fair value of these awards is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period together with a corresponding change in equity.
The fair value is measured using the HullWhite trinomial model by reference to the share price, and taking into account the terms and conditions of the award, excluding nonmarket vesting conditions, at the date the awards were granted.
The charge is reassessed at each balance sheet date to reflect the expected and actual levels of vesting, due to achievement or otherwise of nonmarket conditions.
Awards where vesting is conditional upon satisfying a market condition or nonvesting condition are treated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or nonvesting condition has been satisified.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.

Summary of significant accounting policies continued Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustments to tax payable for previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: Where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual results may differ, possibly significantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cashgenerating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
These are described in note 15.
Defined benefit pension plans The pension cost and the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension plans are based on a number of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the plans assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future periods.
The effect of changing these assumptions is described in note 11.
80 overview business review governance financial statements 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition For revenue recognition purposes contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other, because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
Management exercises a degree of judgement in setting the criteria used for determining when revenue which involves several elements should be recognised and the fair values allocated to each element.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain.
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are disclosed in note 23.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of these financial statements: Effective for annual International Accounting periods beginning Standards IAS IFRS on or after IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 IAS 1 Amendments to IAS 1 Clarification of the Requirements for Comparative Information 1 January 2013 IAS 16 Amendments to IAS 16 Classification of Servicing Equipment 1 January 2013 IAS 19 Employee Benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Amendments to IAS 32 Tax Effect of Distribution to Holders of Equity Instruments 1 January 2013 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2013 IFRS 1 Amendments to IFRS 1 Government Loans 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Amendments to IFRS 7 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS 10, 11 and IAS 27 Investment Entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 10, 11 and 12 Consolidated Financial Statements, Joint Arrangements and Disclosure of Interests 1 January 2013 in Other Entities: Transition Guidance Annual Improvements 20092011 Cycle 1 January 2013 81 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application other than in relation to IAS 19.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benefits the interest income for the defined benefit pension plans would reduce by approximately $1.2 million at current levels of funding.
This change results from the expected rate of return on the pension plan assets being the same rate as the discount rate used to discount the plan liabilities.
In addition the administrative expenses of running the plans would be expensed to operating costs.
The impact would be to increase operating costs by approximately $1.1 million.

Operating segments The Groups organisational structure is based on differences in the products and services offered by each segment and information regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Executive Officer, its chief operating decision maker, is presented on this basis.
The Groups operating segments follow this structure.
The Groups continuing reportable operating segments are Performance Analysis and Service Assurance.
Its Systems segment was sold during the year and is disclosed as a discontinued operation in these financial statements.
The Group evaluates segment operating profit before exceptional items, acquisition related costs, acquired intangible asset amortisation and sharebased payment.
Finance income and finance costs are not allocated to the reportable segments.
Corporate is not an operating segment and costs are separately reported and not allocated to the reportable segments.
Information on segment assets and segment liabilities is not regularly provided to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and is therefore not disclosed below.
The principal activities of each of the continuing reportable operating segments are as follows: Performance Analysis provides solutions that test a broad range of communications technologies critical to the development of nextgeneration network equipment and devices.
Service Assurance provides network monitoring and field test solutions to allow service providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine how to resolve issues with networks and systems within the live network.

Pensions Defined benefit plans The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Groups most significant plan.
There is in addition a United Kingdom unfunded plan.
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Assets UK defined benefit pension plan Cash Plan 0.7 Liabilities UK defined benefit pension plan Staff Plan 24.8 12.5 UK unfunded plan 0.8 0.6 25.6 13.1 The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the plans as at 1 April 2009.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2012 2011 % % Inflation RPI 2.9 3.0 Inflation CPI 2.2 2.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.9 3.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.8 2.9 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 1.9 2.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.2 2.0 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.3 4.6 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 5.0 5.5 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.

Pensions continued The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by $4.1 million.
Increasing RPI inflation by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans liabilities by $1.3 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor would increase past service liabilities by $10.4 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 of $0.8 million 2011 $0.6 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There were no experience gains or losses in the period from 2008 to 2012 on the unfunded plan.

Employer contributions into these plans for 2012 were $1.3 million 2011 $1.4 million.
United States The Group maintains a defined contribution pension plan for employees of its United States subsidiaries.
This plan, also known as a 401 k Plan, allows employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
The investment choices offered by the plan are a selection of diversified mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate, the Groups contributions to the US plan totalled $3.4 million for 2012 2011 $3.2 million.
Total assets in the defined contribution plan at the end of 2012 were $167.0 million 2011 $145.7 million.
There were no defined benefit plans in the United States in 2012 or 2011.
Other jurisdictions Outside the United Kingdom and the United States employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations.
These arrangements are defined contribution plans.

Mu.
Mu was acquired by Spirent on 23 April 2012.
See note 32 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill of $30.9 million and acquired intangible assets of $20.5 million, in relation to computer software, customer relationships, brands and the database have been recognised on the acquisition of Metrico Wireless, Inc. Metrico.
Metrico was acquired by Spirent on 13 September 2012.
Both Mu and Metrico were integrated into the Performance Analysis division during 2012 and the goodwill arising on these acquisitions has been allocated to this cashgenerating unit.
Amortisation and impairment charges Goodwill at 31 December 2012 acquired through business combinations is all in the cashgenerating unit Performance Analysis which is a reportable segment.
There has been no goodwill impairment charged in 2012 or 2011.
Acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are between two and a half and seven years and the charge is included within administration expenses in the income statement.
Other intangible assets are in relation to licences and other agreements which are amortised over their useful lives or term, being three to five years, and are expensed within cost of sales or selling costs.
The remaining amortisation periods of the acquired intangible asset balances arising in relation to customer list and current technology are seven and five years, respectively.
Annual impairment test Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cashgenerating unit at 30 November 2012, the annual impairment testing date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using managements cash flow projections over a five year period.
The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the Groups three year strategic plan.
Cash flows for years four and five are then extrapolated based on long range plans.
The key factor in the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue.
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.75 per cent growth rate 2011 2.75 per cent which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which this unit operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pretax discount rate of 14.5 per cent 2011 14.9 per cent.
The recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
96 overview business review governance financial statements 15.
Intangible assets continued Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were: Revenue growth rates Gross margin Operating expenses Discount rate Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year period covered by managements projections Projections are denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in managements projections are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served and take into account historic levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology and macroeconomic conditions.
The cash flows used in the impairment review have been approved by the Board.
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth and recent acquisitions.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is determined based on Spirents weighted average cost of capital by taking the risk free rate for ten year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cashgenerating unit.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of Spirent relative to the market as a whole.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions The directors believe that no reasonable possible change in any of the key assumptions used in isolation would cause the carrying value of Performance Analysis to exceed its recoverable amount.

The deferred tax asset includes $2.0 million 2011 $3.8 million in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise of share incentives of which $1.0 million 2011 $2.0 million has been recognised in equity.
Movements in deferred tax in relation to the pension plan have been charged or credited to other comprehensive income in all years.
All deferred tax assets on temporary differences, arising principally in the United Kingdom and United States, have been recognised at 31 December 2012 and 2011 apart from $1.6 million in Canada 2011 $1.5 million.
The Group has tax losses arising in the United Kingdom of $64.0 million 2011 $81.7 million that are available for offset against suitable future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
United Kingdom tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In total deferred tax assets amounting to $16.3 million 2011 $22.0 million have not been recognised.
The Group also has capital losses carried forward of $1,340.3 million 2011 $1,311.3 million for which no defered tax asset is recognised on the balance sheet.
These capital losses have no expiry date.
The Chancellor, in the 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012, announced that the main corporation tax rate would be reduced to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 and that there would be a further reduction of 1 per cent with effect from 1 April 2014.
The Finance Act 2012 received Royal Assent on 17 July 2012 with the rate reduction from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 being substantively enacted from 3 July 2012.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 23 per cent.
Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reduction would not be material to the financial statements.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions, is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
All of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables and these are shown in the following table: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Loans and Loans and receivables at receivables at amortised cost amortised cost Noncurrent cash on deposit note 21 0.4 0.7 Noncurrent trade and other receivables note 20 4.2 3.0 Cash and cash equivalents note 21 248.6 236.5 Current trade and other receivables note 20 88.3 98.5 Financial assets 341.5 338.7 Noncurrent other payables and accruals note 24 2.8 1.6 Current trade payables and accruals note 22 52.1 67.1 Share buyback obligation note 22 8.1 7.8 Provisions note 25 5.0 4.5 Financial liabilities 68.0 81.0 The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate.
These derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value, however the fair values at 31 December 2012 and 2011 were immaterial to these accounts.
The key objective of the Groups treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a Market risk The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Groups excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on demand or short term bank deposits.
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Groups financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
103 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Short term bank deposits all mature within three months.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts all mature within three months.
The financial instruments bear the following interest rates: effective Effective interest rate 2012 interest rate 2011 % $ million % $ million Fixed rate Fixed deposits 0.42 44.1 0.39 59.1 Floating rate Cash at bank and in hand 204.5 177.4 Interest rates on financial instruments classified as fixed rate are fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
All fixed rate deposits mature within three months after which date they will be exposed to floating rates of interest.
In addition, $0.4 million 2011 $0.7 million was held in a blocked trust account and was earning interest of 0.44 per cent at 31 December 2012 2011 0.77 per cent.
The maturity of the deposit is three months, at maturity the interest rate will be reset.
This cash must be retained in the blocked trust account in accordance with the terms of the undertakings made at the time of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation in 2004.
The funds must remain in this account until creditors which existed at the date of the Cancellation have been repaid and therefore the maturity of this account is uncertain.
Interest receivable for the year was $0.8 million note 8 2011 $1.0 million and is under the effective interest method.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above table are noninterest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
A movement of 25 basis points in interest rates based on levels of investment at 31 December 2012 would increase or reduce interest income and equity by $0.5 million.
Exchange rate risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has the majority of its operations in the United States and presents its consolidated financial statements in US dollars.
The Companys functional currency is sterling and its share capital is denominated in pounds sterling, the Group also has operations in Europe and Asia and therefore its results and assets and liabilities are affected on translation by movements in exchange rates in relation to the US dollar.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are considered accounting and not cash exposures.
The Group is not exposed to significant transactional foreign currency risk at 31 December 2012, nor at 31 December 2011, because the majority of its businesses do not enter into nonfunctional currency transactions.
Where such transactions do occur the Group typically enters into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as appropriate.
Group treasury, by means of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, carries out the transaction hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity.
At 31 December 2012 the Group has hedged the majority of its financial assets and liabilities in relation to trading which are denominated in nonfunctional currencies.
However, the Group holds cash balances in nonfunctional currencies which are exposed to US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
104 overview business review governance financial statements 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued At 31 December 2012 these balances amounted to $0.9 million 2011 $2.0 million.
A 10 per cent appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the US dollar would increase or reduce profit before tax by $0.1 million 2011 $0.2 million based on the balance at the reporting dates.
b Credit risk Investment counterparties are subject to preapproval by the Board and as such short term deposits are limited to banks with a rating of Standard & Poors A or Moodys A.
There are preapproved limits set for each bank to avoid any concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date under financial instruments in relation to cash and bank deposits is equal to the carrying value of $249.0 million 2011 $237.2 million.
Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for uncollectable amounts where appropriate.
Trade receivable exposures are managed in the business units where they arise.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account ageing profile, experience and circumstance.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk attributable to its trade receivables as the exposure is spread over a large number of customers with no one customer accounting for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenue.
The maximum credit exposure at the balance sheet date in relation to trade receivables is equal to the carrying value of $86.0 million 2011 $95.2 million.
The composition of trade receivables at 31 December is as follows: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Neither impaired nor past due 58.8 61.7 Past due but not impaired: Less than 30 days overdue 14.1 24.5 30 to 60 days 5.2 5.0 Over 60 days 7.9 4.0 Trade receivables 86.0 95.2 The Group closely monitors amounts due from customers and performs activities such as credit checks and review of payment history and has put in place appropriate credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures management assessed the quality of those receivables that are past due but not impaired as low risk.
The movement on the receivables provision during the year is given in note 20.
The value of impaired trade receivables is $0.8 million 2011 $0.9 million.
For all other financial assets the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount.
c Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are financed through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had cash and cash equivalents of $248.6 million 2011 $236.5 million of which $164.5 million 2011 $177.4 million is available on demand and $84.1 million 2011 $59.1 million of which is on one months notice or matures within three months.
During 2012 the Group generated $105.1 million of cash from operating activities 2011 $98.7 million and considers that with current cash resources, no debt and positive cash flow from its operating activities it has adequate resources available to it to remain in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
105 spirent COMMUniCAtiOns plC AnnUAl repOrt 2012 notes to the ConsolIdated fInanCIal statements CONTINUED 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk management continued The Group has entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts all of which mature within three months.
The gross settlement amounts of these contracts are as follows: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Sale of US dollars against sterling 3.6 8.8 The Group is debt free and does not have loans payable.
Financial liabilities are trade and other payables, the majority of which are all due to be settled within one year, and provisions note 25.
The Group does not have any other material financial contractual commitments.
d Fair value of financial instruments The carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value although the amounts at 31 December 2012 and 2011 were immaterial.
The fair value of currency derivatives is determined by reference to forward foreign currency exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, and is therefore determined to be a level 2 financial instrument as its value is based on observable market inputs.
e Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups capital is its total shareholders funds.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions.
During 2012 and 2011 the Company has been operating an on market share repurchase programme.
In 2012 the Company repurchased 13.4 million of its Ordinary Shares at a cost of $30.8 million 2011 17.6 million at a cost of $34.2 million.
The Group intends to continue to repurchase shares to manage the dilution attributable to the Groups share incentive schemes and to repurchase further shares on a oneoff basis as it deems appropriate.
Spirents policy on the payment of dividends to shareholders is to maintain a sustainable progressive dividend with high dividend cover.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Within one year 7.9 9.1 In the second to fifth years 9.9 10.0 Over five years 0.3 0.4 18.1 19.5 The Group leases certain land and buildings under noncancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms.
The Group also leases certain plant and equipment under noncancellable operating lease agreements.
There are no sublease payments receivable relating to the above leases 2011 $0.1 million recognised within one year.

4.4 million Ordinary Shares were purchased and placed into the ESOT during 2011.
There has been no material increase in the issued Ordinary Share capital, whether by exercise of share incentives or otherwise, between 31 December 2012 and 28 February 2013, the date on which these financial statements have been signed.
b Equity and reserves The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows: i Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value: ii Capital redemption reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share capital cancellation: iii Other reserves: share capital, share premium account and capital redemption reserve are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant exchange differences are included in other reserves: and iv Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
Investment in own Ordinary Shares At 31 December 2012, the ESOT held 2.3 million Ordinary Shares 2011 7.9 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards under various share incentive plans.
In addition at 31 December 2011 the ESOT held 0.1 million Ordinary Shares which were the beneficial property of an employee shareholder.
At 31 December 2012, the SST held 0.5 million Ordinary Shares 2011 0.5 million Ordinary Shares to satisfy awards made to United Kingdom based employees under an all employee share scheme.
The market value of own Ordinary Shares held in trust, being in total 2.8 million Ordinary Shares 2011 8.5 million Ordinary Shares, at 31 December 2012 was $6.9 million 2011 $15.5 million.

Equity continued Cancellation of share premium account and capital redemption reserve On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at $1,321.1 million 702.7 million and $1.3 million 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated, was transferred to a special nondistributable reserve.
During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, and who still remained creditors, to a blocked trust account.
Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to distributable reserves.
Capital redemption reserve During 2012 the Company cancelled 13.4 million Ordinary Shares 2011 13.2 million Ordinary Shares that had been the subject of the on market share repurchase programme, and transferred $0.7 million 2011 $0.7 million to the capital redemption reserve.

Employee share plans continued Description of employee share plans Discretionary plans 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP The EIP, which was approved by shareholders and introduced in 2005, is available for selected employees, including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, sharesettled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS.
For Performance share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return TSR.
For awards made since 2011, performance conditions relate to the Companys EPS and TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 55 to 67.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP is now closed for new awards and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and sharesettled SARs.
No price was payable on the grant of an award.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of SSIP awards made to Bill Burns prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
All outstanding awards have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the seventh anniversary of their respective grant dates.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
At 31 December 2012, 1.7 million EIP SARs and 1.8 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 118 pence and 50 pence respectively were outstanding 2011 0.9 million EIP SARs and 7.3 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 91 pence and 51 pence respectively.
During 2012, 5.6 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the transfer of 3.9 million Ordinary Shares 2011 3.6 million Ordinary Shares were issued or transferred on the exercise of 2.1 million EIP and SSIP SARs.

Employee share plans continued 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
All Employee plans UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK employees.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using deductions from payroll.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan US ESPP The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making sixmonthly invitations to employees.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company using the proceeds of a savings contract.
If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month.
No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the US or UK to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In September 2011, the first such invitation was made to all employees in Canada, Hong Kong, France and Germany and subsequent invitations have been made in 2012.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit.
2005 Sharesave Scheme The 2005 Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders in 2005 and was introduced following the expiry of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The scheme is an HMRC approved SaveAsYouEarn scheme open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
No invitations have yet been made under this scheme.
