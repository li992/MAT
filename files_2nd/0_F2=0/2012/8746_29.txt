If the value, based on future anticipated profit, is lower than the book value, the difference is written off as a property impairment.
For the year under review, the company projected cash flows for the pubs under review for the 52 weeks to July 2013, with certain assumptions about sales, costs and profit, using a pre-tax discount rate for future years of 10% 2011: 10%.
As a result of this exercise, an impairment loss of 7,823,000 2011: 4,410,000 was charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each pub, could cause the carrying value of the pub to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.
