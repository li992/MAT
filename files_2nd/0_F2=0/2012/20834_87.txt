Net foreign exchange losses The Group recognised net foreign exchange losses of 2.7 million 2011: 10.2 million in the income statement during the year.
The Group writes business in many currencies and although a large proportion of the Groups balance sheet assets and liabilities are matched, minimising the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Groups result, it is not practical to match exactly all assets and liabilities in currency.
Accounting standards also require that certain classes of assets and liabilities be translated at different rates see foreign currency translation accounting policy.
Included within the Groups foreign exchange losses in the income statement are: 2012 2011 m m Underwriting exchange losses Net losses on underwriting transactions and translation of underwriting assets and liabilities at closing rates 10.5 5.9 10.5 5.9 Non-underwriting exchange gains losses Gains losses on long-term US dollar borrowings 2.8 0.2 Net gains losses on non-underwriting transactions and translation of non-underwriting assets and liabilities at closing rates 5.0 4.1 7.8 4.3 Total net foreign exchange losses 2.7 10.2 The above excludes foreign exchange gains and losses in relation to financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
