New business profitability is measured by both the ratio of the VNB to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP as well as to the annual premium equivalent APE, and shown under PVNBP margin and APE margin below.
APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
Old Mutual Bermuda is excluded from the tables below as it is closed to new business.

The VNB for Old Mutual Wealth in December 2012 has been calculated after the reallocation of certain development costs from acquisition expenses to expense variances.
If December 2011 VNB was calculated on the same basis, it would have been 85 million.
Additional new business written in the Group The value of new individual unit trust-linked retirement annuities and pension fund asset management business written by the Emerging Markets long-term business of 1,093 million 2011: 884 million is excluded as the profits on this business arise in the asset management business.
The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The value of new institutional investment platform pensions business written in Old Mutual Wealth of 736 million 2011: 704 million is excluded as this is more appropriately classified as unit trust business.
New business single premiums of 37 million 2011: 31 million, annualised recurring premiums of 17 million 2011: 14 million, and APE of 21 million 2011: 17 million, in respect of the life business in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, have been excluded from the above tables, as no VNB and PVNBP calculations have been performed for these businesses.

2 A further 36 million 2011: 69 million relates to the non-covered business.
This brings the total adjustment to IFRS net asset value to 1,360 million 2011: 2,607 million.
The adjustments to include long-term business on a statutory solvency basis reflect the difference between the net worth of each business on the statutory basis as required by the local regulator and their portion of the Groups consolidated equity shareholder funds.
In South Africa, these values exclude items that are eliminated or shown separately on consolidation such as Nedbank and inter-company loans.
For some European countries the value reflected in the adjustment to include long-term business on a statutory solvency basis includes the value of the deferred acquisition cost asset, which is part of the equity.
The adjustment to include long-term business on a statutory solvency basis includes the following: The excess of the IFRS amount of the deferred acquisition cost DAC and value of business acquired VOBA assets over the statutory levels included in the VIF with the exception of the Old Mutual Bermuda business where DAC is an admissible asset under local statutory basis When projecting future profits on a statutory basis, the VIF includes the shareholders value of unrealised capital gains.
To the extent that assets in IFRS are valued at market and the market value is higher than the statutory book value, these profits have already been taken into account in the IFRS equity.
For Old Mutual Bermuda business, VIF reflects the impact of amortising DAC allowed under the ANW at 31 December 2011.
DAC has been completely written off at 31 December 2012.
246 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business D1: Sensitivity tests The tables below show the sensitivity of the MCEV, value of in-force business at 31 December 2012 and the value of new business for the year ended 31 December 2012 to the following: Economic assumptions 100 bps increase decrease: Increasing decreasing all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions projected investment returns and inflation by 100 bps, with credited rates and discount rates changing commensurately Equity property market value 10% increase decrease: Equity and property market value increasing decreasing by 10%, with all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions unchanged 10 bps increase of liquidity spreads: Recognising the present value of an additional 10 bps of liquidity spreads assumed on corporate bonds over the lifetime of the liabilities, with credited rates and discount rates changing commensurately 25% increase in equity property and swaption implied volatilities: 25% multiplicative increase in implied volatilities Vnb 10% increase in acquisition expenses: For value of new business, acquisition expenses other than commission and commission related expenses increasing by 10%, with no corresponding increase in policy charges Vnb on closing economic assumptions: Value of new business calculated on economic assumptions at the end of reporting period nhr capital diversification: Residual non-hedgeable risk capital reduced to incorporate diversification benefits between hedgeable and non-hedgeable risks for covered business 99.93% confidence level nhr capital: Economic capital for residual non-hedgeable risks calculated assuming a 99.93% confidence level which is targeted by an internal economic capital model.
For each sensitivity illustrated, all other assumptions have been left unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised conditions.
Sensitivity scenarios therefore include consistent changes in cash flows directly affected by the changed assumption s, for example future bonus participation in changed economic scenarios.
In some jurisdictions the reserving basis that underlies shareholder distributable cash flows is dynamic, and in theory some sensitivities could change not only future experience but also reserving levels.
Modeling of dynamic reserves is extremely complex and the effect on value is second-order.
Therefore, in performing the sensitivities, reserving bases have been kept constant for non-linked business including non-linked reserves for linked business whilst only varying future experience assumptions with similar considerations applying to required capital.
However the sensitivities for South Africa in respect of an increase decrease of all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions, an increase decrease in equity and property market values and increases in equity, property and swaption implied volatilities allow for the change in the time value of financial options and guarantees that form part of the Investment Guarantee Reserves IGR.
The sensitivities for an increase decrease in all pre-tax investment and economic assumptions with credited rates and discount rates changing commensurately are calculated in line with a parallel shift in risk-free reference spot rates rather than risk-free reference forward rates.
However, the 1% reduction is limited so that it does not lead to negative risk-free reference rates.
VNB sensitivities assume that the scenario arises immediately after point of sale of the contract.
Therefore no allowance is made for the ability to re-price any contracts in the sensitivity scenarios, apart from the mortality sensitivities for the South African business where allowance is made for changes in the pricing basis for products with reviewable premiums.
At 31 December 2011, Nordic was included in all sensitivities.
