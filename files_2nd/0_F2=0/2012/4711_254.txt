Executive share award plans a Performance share plan PSP 2008 This plan was introduced in October 2008 and replaced a similar plan.
Under the PSP, share awards can take a number of different forms.
No payment is made for awards.
To date, participants have been granted conditional rights to receive shares.
Awards normally vest after a three year period the performance cycle subject to achievement of performance tests.
For awards up to and including September 2010, the primary performance test is a comparison of Diageos three year total shareholder return TSR the percentage growth in Diageos share price assuming all dividends and capital distributions are reinvested with the TSR of a peer group of 16 companies including Diageo.
TSR calculations are converted into a common currency US dollars.
The vesting range is 25% if Diageos TSR produces a median ranking compared with the TSR of the peer group companies, up to 100% if Diageo is ranked first or second in the peer group.
The second performance test requires the remuneration committee to consider that there has been an underlying improvement in Diageos three year financial performance, typically measured by an improvement in adjusted eps.
For awards made from September 2011, three equally weighted performance tests apply: 1 a comparison of Diageos three year TSR as described above with a peer group of 17 companies including Diageo.
The vesting range is 25% if Diageos TSR produces a median ranking compared with the TSR of the peer group companies, up to 100% if Diageo is ranked first, second or third in the peer group: 2 compound annual growth in organic net sales over three years: 3 total organic operating margin improvement over three years.
Targets for net sales and operating margin are set annually by the remuneration committee.
The vesting range is 25% for achieving minimum performance targets, up to 100% for achieving the maximum target level.
Dividends are accrued on awards and are given to participants to the extent that the awards actually vest at the end of the performance cycle.
Dividends can be paid in the form of cash or shares.
b Discretionary incentive plan 2009 DIP 2009 This scheme was introduced in October 2009 and replaced a similar plan.
Awards over shares or ADSs are granted under the plan, normally in the form of conditional rights to receive shares or ADSs.
Awards vest over a three to five-year period with performance criteria varying by employee.
In certain markets DELTIP, DACSIP, ISMP and PSP work as cash alternative plans where due to legislation and tax rules it is prohibitive to grant share options or shares settled directly in equity.
From the employees perspective it works in the same way as a normal share option or share except that employees do not have the right to own a share when they exercise their share options or their shares vests.

The expected life of the options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding.
The group uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model.
Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the groups shares, historical volatility of the groups shares and other factors.
Option holdings in the following tables are stated as ordinary share equivalents in pence.
Options prices are translated at the following exchange rates: grants at actual exchange rates: exercises and cancellations at average exchange rates: and closing balances at year end exchange rates.
