The sensitivity of the Companys equity investments to general movements in equity markets has been adjusted by the use of the equity derivatives instruments detailed on pages 46 and 47, with the sales of equity index futures reducing sensitivity to market movements and the purchase of equity index call options increasing it.
Further details of the impact of these instruments on the portfolio are set out in the Investment Activity section of the Chairmans Statement on page 4 and in the Managers Portfolio Review on page 6.
After taking into account the impact of the equity index futures and options open at the balance sheet date, a 5% increase in listed equity valuations at 30 April 2012 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 41,777,000 2011 53,385,000.
