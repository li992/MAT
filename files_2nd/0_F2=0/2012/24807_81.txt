Foreign currency risk sensitivity At 31 December 2012, had sterling strengthened by 10% 2011 10% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation would have decreased by the amounts shown below based solely on translation of securities quoted in currencies overseas.
A 10% 2011 10% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
However, companies whose cost base diverges in currency terms from its sales will in the longer term have a significantly greater effect on valuation than simple translation.
In the short term investee companies generally cover their currency exposure to varying degrees.
There is insufficient publicly disclosed information to quantify this, but in the long term this effect is expected to dwarf simple translation of foreign listings in terms of both risk and reward, because many investee companies trade globally.
Furthermore, the country of listing is not necessarily an indication of the geography of some or even any operational activities for investee companies.
The Manager does not use financial instruments to protect against currency movements.
From time to time financial leverage has been made using debt in overseas currencies.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment which it has entered into with the Company.
The Manager monitors counterparty risk on an ongoing basis.
The Company has investments in convertible loan stocks that have an element of equity.
These securities are viewed as having a risk profile similar to the equity holdings.
This is because the convertibles held are in nascent technology companies that may be loss making and may have weak balance sheets.
For this reason these stocks are categorised as equity holdings.
The fixed interest securities held are UK and Norwegian Government securities and UK corporate bonds.
