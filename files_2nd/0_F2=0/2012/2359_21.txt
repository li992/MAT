Notes to the financial statements Bovis Homes Group PLC the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 22 February 2013.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRS and its interpretations as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and available for sale assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of adopted IFRSs that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 26.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all relevant periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the Company and the Group where relevant.
Going concern The Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future.
The Directors reviewed detailed financial forecasts and covenant compliance covering the period to December 2013 and summary financial forecasts for the following two years.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group held cash and cash equivalents of 24.4 million and had total borrowings of 5.6 million.
After the year end the Group has entered into a 125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three year term loan of 25 million.
This financing arrangement replaced the Groups previous 150 million committed revolving credit facility.
For these reasons, the Directors consider it appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
Impact of standards and interpretations effective for the first time The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations are mandatory for the first time for the Companys year ended 31 December 2012.
They have had no material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IFRS 7 Transfers of Financial Assets.
The Amendments require additional disclosures about transfers of financial assets, e, g, securitisations and should enable users to understand the possible effects of any risks that may remain with the transferor.
The amendments also require additional disclosures if a disproportionate amount of transfer transactions are undertaken around the end of a reporting period.
Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets.
The Amendment introduces an exception to the current measurement principles of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
The exception also applies to investment properties acquired in a business combination accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations provided the acquirer subsequently measure these assets applying the fair value model.
The other standards and interpretations that are applicable for the first time in the Groups financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, have no effect on these financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Joint ventures are those entities in which the Group has joint control over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity accounted basis, from the date that joint control commenced until joint control ceases.

Accounting policies Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of consideration received or receivable, net of value-assed tax, rebated and discounts.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward legal completion of properties accepted in part exchange against a new property.
The net gain or loss arising from the legal completion of these part exchange properties is recognised in cost of sales.
Revenue is recognised once the value of the transaction can be reliably measured and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Revenue is recognised on house sales at legal completion.
Revenue is recognised on land sales and commercial property sales from the point of unconditional exchange of contracts.
For affordable housing sales in bulk, revenue is recognised upon practical completion.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expenditure.
Net financing costs Net finance costs comprise: interest payable on borrowings, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: interest receivable on funds invested accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method: imputed interest on available-for-sale financial assets, fair valued interest free loans and on deferred terms land payables: pension finance costs or benefits being the net of interest costs on liabilities and expected return on assets linked to the Defined Benefit Scheme: and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Finance costs are included in the measurement of borrowings at their amortised cost to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Group is required to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction and production of a qualifying asset, as part of the costs of that asset.
Inventories which are produced in large quantities on a repetitive basis over a short period of time are not qualifying assets.
The Group does not generally produce qualifying assets.
Taxation Income tax comprises the sum of the tax currently payable or receivable and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable or receivable is based on taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit or loss differs from net profit or loss as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability or asset for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from non-tax deductible goodwill, from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, and from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts where deemed appropriate to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
70 | Annual report and accounts | Financial Notes to the financial statements continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any ineffectiveness in the hedge relationship are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is retained in reserves until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in reserves is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Certain property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to adopted IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, this being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Regular reviews of the carrying values of property are completed to assess any impairment in value.
When impairment is identified, the assets recoverable amount is assessed and any shortfall is written off through the income statement.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost less residual value which is reassessed annually of assets over their estimated useful lives.
Depreciation is charged on property in respect of the value of the building.
The basis of depreciation for each class of asset is as follows: Buildings straight line over 50 years Plant and machinery 33.3% reducing balance Computer equipment straight line over 3 years Office equipment 25% reducing balance The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less impairment.
Following the issue of IFRIC11 in 2007, the Parent Company accounts for the share-based payments granted to subsidiary employees as an increase in the cost of its investment in subsidiaries.
Listed investments are stated at fair value.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Receivables on extended terms granted as part of a sales transaction are secured by way of a legal charge on the relevant property, categorised as an available for sale financial asset and are stated at fair value as described in note 13.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity in retained earnings, with the exceptions of impairment losses, the impact of changes in future cash flows and interest calculated using the effective interest rate method, which are recognised directly in the income statement.
Where the investment is disposed of, or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Given its materiality, this item is being disclosed separately on the face of the balance sheet.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads, not including any general administrative overheads, that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated net selling price less estimated total costs of completion of the finished goods.
Land held for development, including land in the course of development until legal completion of the sale of the asset, is initially recorded at cost along with any expected overage.
Where, through deferred purchase credit terms, cost differs from the nominal amount which will actually be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability, an adjustment is made to the cost of the land, the difference being charged as a finance cost.
Options purchased in respect of land are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these options, and provisions made accordingly to reflect loss of value.
The impairment reviews consider the period elapsed since the date of purchase of the option given that the option contract has not been exercised at the review date.
Further, the impairment reviews consider the remaining life of the option, taking account of any concerns over whether the remaining time available will allow successful exercise of the option.
The carrying cost of the option at the date of exercise is included within the cost of land purchased as a result of the option exercise.
Investments in land without the benefit of planning consent, either through purchase of freehold land or non refundable deposits paid on land purchase contracts subject to residential planning consent, are capitalised initially at cost.
Regular reviews are completed for impairment in the value of these investments, and provision made to reflect any irrecoverable element.
The impairment reviews consider the existing use value of the land and assesses the likelihood of achieving residential planning consent and the value thereof.
Ground rents are held at an estimate of cost based on a multiple of ground rent income, with a corresponding credit created against cost of sales, in the year in which the ground rent first becomes payable by the leasehold purchaser.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Bovis Homes Group PLC | 71 Notes to the financial statements continued Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs, and subsequently at amortised cost.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Government grants Government grants are recognised in the income statement so as to match with the related costs that they are intended to compensate.
Government grants are included within deferred income.
The benefit on loans with an interest rate below market is calculated as the difference between interest at a market rate and the below market interest.
The benefit is treated as a Government grant.
Kickstart The Group has been granted assistance for the development of a number of sites under the Homes and Communities Agency HCA Kickstart scheme.
Where receipts under the Kickstart scheme relate to grants they are accounted for in accordance with the policy for government grants stated above.
In addition the Group has received cash upon specific sites under the Kickstart equity scheme which may be repayable in future periods, as the sites to which it relates are developed, along with the share of the profits or losses attributable to the HCA arising from the sites.
This grant element is included within deferred income to the extent that it is currently estimated that future economic benefit will be derived and will be released to the income statement in line with sales from the relevant site.
If part or all the equity schemes are expected to be repaid these are shown in other creditors.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms, particularly in respect of land, are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value which will be paid in settling the deferred purchase terms liability is recognised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity through an own shares held reserve.
Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Revised : Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit schemes, the net obligation is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods, such benefits measured at discounted present value, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The discount rate used to discount the benefits accrued is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The operating and financing costs of such plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2: Share-based payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees in the form of share options over shares in the Parent Company.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant calculated using an independent option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding credit to equity except when the share-based payment is cancelled where the charge will be accelerated.
Segment reporting As the Groups main operation is that of a housebuilder and it operates entirely within the United Kingdom, there are no separate segments, either business or geographic, to disclose, having taken into account the aggregation criteria provisions of IFRS8.
Exceptional items Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Examples of events that, inter alia, may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional are the restructuring of existing and newly-acquired businesses, gains or losses on the disposal of businesses or individual assets and asset impairments, including currently developable land, work in progress and goodwill.

A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly and reduce the companys deferred tax asset which has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Non-current trade payables The Group recognises differences between the fair value and nominal value of long term creditors relating to purchases of land for development and charges these differences as finance costs using the effective interest method.
The Group does not receive a tax deduction for this difference between fair value and nominal value when it is charged to the income statement, a tax deduction being obtained at a later date when the associated land cost is charged on legal completion of the house sale.
As at 31 December 2012, 10,423,000 2011: 11,284,000 of finance costs had not received a tax deduction.
The Group anticipates obtaining a current tax deduction in respect of this in the future and has therefore created a deferred tax asset to reflect this future tax deduction.
Employee benefits The Group recognises the deficit or surplus on its defined benefits pension scheme under the requirements of IAS19 Revised : Employee benefits.
This has generated a deficit of 3.2 million 2011: 2.4 million.
As at 31 December 2012 a deferred tax asset of 729,000 2011: 616,000 was recognised.

The assessment of carrying value of inventory at the year end has resulted in a 34,000 release of inventory provision as at 31 December 2012 2011: no net release.
There was a gross increase of 2.1 million in the provision and an off setting decrease of 2.1 million.
Following this review, 79.3 million 2011: 114.4 million of inventories were valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historic cost.

The Group participates in three schemes.
Jumpstart schemes are receivable 10 years after recognition with 3% interest charged between years 6 to 10.
The HomeBuy Direct and FirstBuy schemes are operated together with the Government.
Receivables are due 25 years after recognition with interest charged from year 6 onwards at a base value of 1.75% plus annual RPI increments.
These assets are held at fair value being the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated date of recovery.
The impairments relate to changes in expected cash flows as a result of movement in future house price expectations.
Further disclosures relating to financial assets are set out in notes 21 and 22.

The amount available depends on the underlying investment undertaken with repayments of this facility reflecting expectations of cash inflow generation from sales at that site, the maximum facility available is 6 million.
The nominal amount at 31 December was 5,400,000.
This has been fair valued using an effective interest rate of LIBOR plus 158bps, creating an accounting movement of 498,000 which is accounted for as a government grant see note 4, which decreases the loan position.
Interest will effectively be charged on this fair valued position over the life of the facility so at relevant repayment dates the value in the accounts for the loan is reflective of the cash amounts to be repaid.
The imputed interest charged in the period was 195,000, which increases the loan value.
The long stop repayment date for this facility is 5 January 2016.
Details of facilities Since the year end the Group has entered into a 125 million committed revolving credit facility expiring in March 2017 and a three-year term loan of 25 million.
This financing arrangement replaces the Groups previous 150 million committed revolving credit facility.
The facility syndicate comprises four existing relationship group banks, one of which is providing the term loan, and one new bank.
The facility and the term loan include a covenant package, featuring three covenants tested semi-annually as per the previous facility agreement.
The overall financing cost of the new arrangement is in line with the existing facility.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 31 December 2012 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 40,857,000 2011: 23,266,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2012 of 133,294,726 2011: 132,860,480, calculated as follows: Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 2012 2011 000 000 Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 40,857 23,266 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 2012 2011 Issued ordinary shares at 1 January 132,860,480 133,218,325 Effect of own shares held 445,306 474,109 Effect of shares issued in year 879,552 116,264 Weighted average number of ordinary shares at 31 December 133,294,726 132,860,480 Diluted earnings per share The calculation of diluted earnings per share at 31 December 2012 was based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 40,857,000 2011: 23,266,000 and a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 31 December 2012 of 133,432,911 2011: 132,944,264.
The average number of shares is diluted in reference to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the period.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the period.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria have been included in the dilution calculation.

The last grant of executive share options took place on 18 March 2003 and the scheme expired in 2007.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, options were granted on a discretionary basis relative to executives seniority within the Group.
The options can be exercised where the cumulative increase in annualised basic earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive financial years.
Assuming this condition is satisfied, options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
There is one historical grant of executive share options prior to 7 November 2002 where there remain exercisable share options unexercised at 31 December 2011.
In accordance with the provisions of IFRS1, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS2 have not been applied to these grants.

Financial risk management Group The Group seeks to manage its capital in such a manner that the Group safeguards its ability to continue as a going concern and to fund its future development.
In continuing as a going concern, it seeks to provide for returns for shareholders as well as enabling repayment of its liabilities as a trading business.
The Groups capital comprises its shareholders equity, added together with its net borrowings stated before issue costs.
A five year record of its capital employed is displayed on page 94 together with a return on capital employed, which indicates that the Group has historically delivered both absolute growth in capital and a return on capital employed of over 20%, although not in the recent past following the market decline.
Whilst the blended cost of capital is a factor in the Groups decision making in assessing the right blend of shareholders equity and debt financing, the Group has typically preferred to operate within a framework that features relatively low gearing or cash in hand.
This is because the Group recognises that housebuilding can be cyclical, and higher levels of gearing can create profound liquidity risks.
The Group would seek to manage its capital base through control over expenditure, maintenance of adequate banking facilities, control over dividend payments and in the longer term through adjustments to its capital structure.
Following the sharp market movements in 2008, the Group saw a fall in its capital employed, as inventory provisions have reduced the asset base of the Group, leading to a reduction in retained earnings and thus shareholders equity.
This was partially reversed in 2009 following a successful equity placing.
An important part of capital management for the Group is its financial instruments, which comprise cash, bank and other loans and overdrafts.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also utilises financial assets and liabilities such as trade payables or receivables that arise directly from operations.
The use of these carries risk: interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Given that the Group trades exclusively in the UK, there is no material currency risk.
The valuation of the Groups available for sale financial assets and a financial liability are also impacted by housing market price fluctuations, giving rise to market price risk.
Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business and interest rate swaps are used where appropriate to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Throughout the year, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Hedging The Group mitigates its exposure to changes in interest rates on a core level of borrowings where appropriate through procuring interest rate swaps, denominated in sterling.
The decision whether to enter into a swap, and the timing of procurement of swaps depends on a number of key variables, on which management form judgements.
These matters include managements view of likely cash flows and indebtedness, interest rate movements and other macro-economic factors looking ahead.
These assumptions are reviewed with the Group Finance Director on a periodic basis prior to any decision being made.
Decisions made by management in this area are discussed with the Board to ensure transparency of decision making.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had a 18.6 million interest rate swap relating to debt held within a joint venture.
The Group pays a fixed interest rate of 1.505% and receives one month LIBOR.
All costs are being taken directly through income.
The fair value measurement of the Groups derivative financial instruments include inputs which are based on observable market data.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis The interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instrument is set out in note 16.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rates, the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations in the Groups earnings, given that Group borrowings are variable in terms of interest rate.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 116,000 2011: increase profit by 308,000.
88 | Annual report and accounts | Financial Notes to the financial statements continued b.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There are certain categories of revenue where this is not the case: for instance, housing association revenues or land sales.
The largest single amount outstanding at the year end was 5.9 million 2011: 10.0 million.
The amount is secured against consented land.
The Group retains these outstanding balances as trade and other receivables.
The Group also carries credit risk with regard to available for sale financial assets which it classifies as other receivables.
Whilst material in total, the individual risk is low given the high number of counterparties.
Average exposure per transaction is 20,000 2011: 23,000, and a second charge is retained to protect the Groups interests.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables equates to the Groups exposure to credit risk.
The Groups trade and other receivables are secured against the following: 2012 2011 000 000 Consented land 22,933 34,249 Second charge against property 45,553 40,429 Unsecured 49,276 43,414 117,762 118,092 In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counter parties before entering into a transaction.
This assessment is based upon management knowledge and experience.
In the event that land is disposed of the Group seeks to mitigate any credit risk by retaining a charge over the asset disposed of, so that in the event of default, the Group is able to seek to recover its outstanding asset.
Company The companys exposure to credit risk is limited as a result of all outstanding balances relating to companies within the Group.
c. Liquidity risk The Groups banking arrangements outlined in note 16 are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium term cash flow needs, thus mitigating its liquidity risk.
The Groups approach to assessment of liquidity risk is outlined in the section on the report on corporate governance relating to Going Concern which can be found on page 36. d. Housing market price risk The performance of the UK housing market affects the valuation of certain of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management in these financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are summarised below: Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total 31 December 2012 000 000 000 Non-derivative financial assets Restricted cash - 1,152 1,152 Trade and other receivables - 66,774 66,774 Available for sale financial assets 50,988 - 50,988 Cash and cash equivalents - 24,396 24,396 Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank and other loans - 5,190 5,190 Trade and other payables - 249,301 249,301 Derivative financial liabilities Other financial liabilities 706 - 706 Derivative - 416 416 50,282 162,585 112,303 Bovis Homes Group PLC | 89 Notes to the financial statements continued Linked to UK Not linked to UK housing market housing market Total 31 December 2011 000 000 000 Non-derivative financial assets Restricted cash - 659 659 Trade and other receivables - 79,439 79,439 Available for sale financial assets 38,653 - 38,653 Cash and cash equivalents - 56,177 56,177 Non-derivative financial liabilities Bank and other loans - 5,402 5,402 Trade and other payables - 248,116 248,116 Derivative financial liabilities Other financial liabilities 1,243 - 1,243 Derivative - 407 407 37,410 117,650 80,240 The fair value measurement of the Groups available for sale financial assets include management assumptions of future house price inflation, and therefore the fair value measurement includes inputs which are necessarily not based on observable market data.

Financial instruments Fair values There is no material difference between the carrying value of financial instruments shown in the balance sheet and their fair value.
Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the Group initially records it at its fair value with a land creditor recorded for any outstanding monies based on this fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined as the outstanding element of the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs using the effective interest rate method, increasing the value of the land creditor such that at the date of maturity the land creditor equals the payment required.

The liability is based on a future discounted cash flow for a nominal value tracking the index until March 2014.
90 | Annual report and accounts | Financial Notes to the financial statements continued Available for sale financial assets The Group determines the fair value of its available for sale financial assets through estimation of the present value of expected future cash flows.
Cash flows are assessed taking into account expectations of the timing of redemption, future house price movement and the risks of default.
An instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate is used to determine present value via discounted cash flow modelling.
Fair value of quoted investments is based on the available price of those quoted investments at the balance sheet date.
Bank and other loans Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest flows.
Interest free loans are fair valued using an effective interest rate method.
See note 16 for further details.
Interest rate swaps At each period end, an external valuation of the fair value of each interest rate swap is obtained from the relevant swap providers.
Trade and other receivables payables Other than land creditors, other financial liabilities and available for sale financial assets, the nominal value of trade receivables and payables is deemed to reflect the fair value.
This is due to the fact that transactions which give rise to these trade receivables and payables arise in the normal course of trade with industry standard payment terms.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The Group uses an instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate to determine the fair value of financial instruments.
The following table provides an analysis of financial assets and liabilities that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1: fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets: Level 2: fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Operating leases Leases as lessee Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2012 2011 Group 000 000 Less than one year 324 4 Between one and five years - - More than five years - - Operating leases 324 4 With regard to the operating leases held by the Group as lessor, the Group recognised 556,000 of rental income in the income statement in 2012 2011: 547,000.
Capital commitments The Group has made nil of plant and equipment expenditure commitments 2011: 150,000.
Contingencies The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of bonds and other agreements entered into in the normal course of business and the Company has guaranteed the performance of certain of these agreements entered into by its subsidiary companies.
The Company had guaranteed the repayment of bank loans made to one of its subsidiaries under a syndicated loan facility agreement.
There were no amounts outstanding under this agreement at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: nil.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty Land held for development and housing work in progress The Group holds inventories which are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
To assess the net realisable value of land held for development and housing work in progress, the Group completes a financial appraisal of the likely revenue which will be generated when these inventories are combined as residential properties for sale and sold.
Where the financial appraisal demonstrates that the revenue will exceed the costs of the inventories and other associated costs of constructing the residential properties, the inventories are stated at cost.
Where the assessed revenue is lower, the extent to which there is a shortfall is written off through the income statement leaving the inventories stated at a recoverable value.
To the extent that the revenues which can be generated change, or the final cost to complete the site varies from estimates, the net realisable value of the inventories may be different.
A review taking into account estimated achievable net revenues, actual inventory and costs to complete as at 22 February 2013 has been carried out, which has identified no net movement in the carrying value of the provision.
These estimates were made by local management having regard to actual selling prices, together with competitor and marketplace evidence, and were further reviewed by Group management.
Should there be a future significant decline in UK house pricing, then further write-downs of land and work in progress may be necessary.
Further details on the carrying value of inventory is laid out in note 12.
Part exchange properties The carrying values of part exchange properties are assessed based on external valuations completed on the properties.
These valuations are based on the prevailing market conditions in the second hand housing market and to the extent that housing market pricing levels change, the achievable values of the part exchange properties may vary.
Part exchange property values at the end of the financial year were based on up to date valuations and were based on realistic market expectations.
Pension assumptions The Group has utilised a range of assumptions including a rate of return on assets, a discount rate and mortality assumptions having been advised by its actuary.
To the extent that such assumed rates are different from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
A 50bps increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would reduce or increase the schemes liabilities by 7.2 million or 8.1 million, respectively.
Available for sale financial assets The estimation of the fair value of available for sale financial assets requires judgement and estimation as to the quantum, timing and value of repayment of the Groups receivable, as well as to the choice of instrument-specific market-assessed interest rate used to determine a discount rate.
Note 21 contains a sensitivity analysis showing the impact of a change in the major judgement factor applied in the valuation of these instruments.
