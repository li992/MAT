We formed partnerships with the Olympic and Paralympic Committees in the UK, US and seven other countries of strategic importance to BP.
We supported 60 athletes as they trained and competed.
We provided advanced fuels and engine oils for 5,000 official vehicles and helped offset carbon emissions produced by over half a million spectators journeys.
We also brought the magic of the Olympic and Paralympic Games to millions through the Cultural Olympiad and the London 2012 Festival.
We believe our support to the Games enabled us to improve perceptions of BP and enhance our reputation, with communications and advertising raising public awareness of BPs contribution.
The Games also provided an opportunity to strengthen our relationships with many business partners from around the world, who took part in an immersive business experience using innovative visual techniques to demonstrate BP technology.
London 2012 was a huge source of inspiration for our employees too, with many having the opportunity to contribute their time and energy to its success.
