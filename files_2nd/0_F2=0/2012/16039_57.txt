The charges arose mainly as a result of the on-going programme to integrate BSS colleagues, systems and processes into the Group, although in 2011 there was a 2.2m charge due to the closure and disposal of businesses that were determined to be non-core to the Groups operations.
The Group released 6.0m through operating profit as exceptional items for onerous lease provisions that are no longer required because properties have been sublet.
The Group recognised 35.3m of exceptional fair value gains in investment income when the requirements of IFRS 3 2008 Business Combinations were applied to the investments held in Toolstation.
This acquisition has resulted in the Groups existing 30% associate interest being re-measured to its fair value at the acquisition date.
The exceptional item recognised by the Group was 2.1m higher due to the revaluation of the intra-group loan.
In accordance with IAS 39 the contingent consideration payable in respect of Toolstation has been reassessed at 31 December 2012 and as a result the discounted amount previously recognised of 51.2m has been reduced to 47.0m with the difference of 4.2m being credited to income statement as exceptional investment income.
To enable readers of the financial statements to obtain a clear understanding of underlying trading, the Directors have shown the exceptional items separately in the group income statement.
