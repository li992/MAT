They are prepared under the historical cost convention, except that derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair value, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards UK GAAP and the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by section 408 4 of the Companies Act 2006, a separate profit and loss account for the Company has not been included in these financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 1, no cash flow statement for the Company has been included on the grounds that the group includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements.
As permitted by FRS 8, no related party disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries have been included.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, not to prepare a note to the financial statements relating to financial instruments as the information is available in the published financial statements of the group.
Intangible assets goodwill Intangible assets consist of goodwill arising on acquisitions since 17 September 1998, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration of businesses over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised in accordance with FRS 10 and amortised over its useful life, not exceeding 20 years.
Goodwill previously written off against reserves has not been reinstated.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are reported at cost less any provision for impairment.
Financial instruments All financial assets and financial liabilities are measured initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, and thereafter at amortised cost.
Pensions and other post-employment benets The Company operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Contributions to the defined contribution scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The principal defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme and the Company is unable to identify its share of underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Hence, contributions to this scheme are accounted for as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme.
The Company has one small unfunded defined benefit scheme which it accounts for in accordance with FRS 17 using the advice of professional actuaries.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the cost of benefits accruing to employees over the year, plus any benefit improvements granted to members during the year.
It also includes a charge equal to the expected interest on plan liabilities over the year.
The present value of plan liabilities is disclosed as a liability on the balance sheet net of any related deferred tax.
Share-based payments The Share Incentive Plan allows employees of the Company to receive allocations of shares to be distributed subject to attainment of certain financial performance criteria and typically after a three-year performance period.
The fair value of the shares to be awarded is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The fair value of the shares allocated is measured taking into account the terms and conditions under which the shares were allocated.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest.
Where the Company grants allocations of shares to employees of its subsidiaries, these are accounted for on the same basis as for allocations to employees of the Company, except that the fair value is recognised as an increase to investment in subsidiaries with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 allows executives to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the executives become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial lattice model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Shares in the Company are held in a separate trust and are deducted in arriving at equity shareholders funds.
