These provisions have been created based on Premiers internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which are believed to be a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for operated fields in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, comprise accounts payable, bank loans, convertible bonds and senior loan notes.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and to raise finance for the groups capital expenditure programme.
The group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 105 17.
Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The groups exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, a substantial portion of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency such as Pound Sterling, Norwegian Kroner receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
Fair value hierarchy In line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2012, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans : Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2012: Oil forward sales contracts 6.1 6.1 Gas forward sale contracts 3.2 3.2 Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.5 0.5 Total 9.8 9.8 2011: Oil reverse collars 48.8 48.8 Gas forward sale contracts 0.3 0.3 Total 49.1 49.1 106 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2012 17.

Commodity price risk Oil At 31 December 2012, the group had 3.0 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged through forward sales at an average floor price of US$109.0 bbl.
The forward sales have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective, with a fair value movement of US$5.1 million recognised directly in retained earnings.
A residual fair value movement of US$1.2 million was credited to the income statement.
The groups long-term oil collars expired on 31 December 2012, resulting in a US$50.0 million credit to the income statement.
During the year, embedded oil price collars and foward oil sales contracts for 3.9 million barrels matured generating a net cost of US$34.4 million 2011: US$101.3 million.
This cost has been offset against sales revenues.
Indonesian gas At the year-end date, 48,000 metric tonnes mt of Singapore 180 HSFO, which underlies the pricing mechanism for Indonesian gas sold into the Singapore market, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-year 2013, with a floor of US$250.0 mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt.
An additional 96,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales contracts for 2013 at an average price of US$657.0 mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 246,000 mt matured generating a cash cost of US$26.3 million 2011: US$17.8 million which have been offset against sales revenues.
All of these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
In the current year, US$3.2 million of the movement in the fair value of these contracts was credited to the income statement 2011: credit of US$6.0 million, as this movement related to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The remaining movement, being a credit of US$15.4 million 2011: charge of US$6.3 million, related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

The collars expired on 31 December 2012.
Commodity contract sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million $ million $ million Ten per cent increase 20.5 8.8 29.3 Ten per cent decrease 20.5 8.4 28.9 Deferred revenue related to oil reverse collars Deferred revenue has been created due to first-day gains arising from offtake agreements and related oil reverse collars which fully expired in 2012.
This deferred revenue is being released to the income statement over the life of each individual offtake agreement as shown below: Oil Gas Total Asset liability $ million $ million $ million At 1 January 2011 35.9 35.9 Credit to income statement for the year 27.5 27.5 At 31 December 2011 8.4 8.4 Credit to income statement for the year 8.4 8.4 At 31 December 2012 108 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2012 17.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk At 31 December 2012, US$300.0 million of the groups long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and are assessed to be effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date.
The movement in fair values is shown in the table below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2011 12.9 Cash settlement for swaps 8.9 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 8.9 Charge to retained earnings for the year 6.4 At 31 December 2011 19.3 Cash settlement for swaps 6.9 Charge to income statement for the year recorded within finance costs and other finance expenses 6.9 Credit to retained earnings for the year 2.5 At 31 December 2012 16.8 Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest rates.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of 50 basis points in this variable: Total Increase decrease in mark-to-market value $ million Increase of fifty basis points 3.4 A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
Foreign currency exchange risk During the year, the group issued 25.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.328:.
This is in addition to existing swaps of 75.0 million at a fixed rate of US$1.423:.
The fair value of these cross currency swaps at the reporting date is shown below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2011 Charge to income statement for the year 9.5 Charge to retained earnings for the year 0.1 At 31 December 2011 9.6 Credit to income statement for the year 1.2 Credit to retained earnings for the year 2.0 At 31 December 2012 6.4 To cover sterling exposures an amount of 497.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year 2011: 182.0 million to cater for its North Sea developments and operations, all of which were closed out by year end.
The groups activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of any reasonably possible variation in foreign exchange rates on the groups results would be immaterial.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 109 17.
Financial instruments continued Other financial instruments Credit risk The groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2012 and 2011.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with at least single A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
An indication of the concentration of credit risk is shown in note 1, whereby the revenue from five customers each exceeded 10 per cent of the groups consolidated revenue in 2012 2011: four.
The ageing profile of the groups trade and other receivables and trade and other payables as at 31 December, including the related undiscounted interest amounts, was: Less than 2 to 3 3 months 1 to 5 Over 5 1 month months to 1 year years years Total $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million $ million 2012: Long term receivables 2.5 2.5 Trade and other receivables 278.4 46.8 8.0 333.2 Trade and other payables 110.5 14.9 11.9 0.3 137.6 Bank loans 3.8 11.7 519.5 535.0 Convertible bonds 1.0 3.0 24.5 251.9 280.4 Senior loan notes 6.0 24.9 123.5 662.4 816.8 Total 166.9 22.1 43.5 667.8 911.8 1,434.1 2011: Trade and other receivables 299.0 18.1 54.2 371.3 Trade and other payables 88.1 28.9 11.1 128.1 Bank loans 201.5 336.2 537.7 Convertible bonds 7.2 260.8 268.0 Senior loan notes 18.8 75.2 398.2 492.2 Total 210.9 10.8 184.4 672.2 398.2 1,054.7 Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities and future capital and operating commitments.
Borrowing facilities The group has committed borrowing facilities of US$1,345.0 million and letter of credit facilities of 216.0 million US$351.1 million, in addition to the convertible bonds and senior loan notes.
The undrawn cash balance from the committed borrowing facilities as at 31 December was: 2012 2011 $ million $ million Expiring in more than one year, but not more than two years 16.4 Expiring in more than two years, but not more than five years 845.0 456.8 The undrawn balance on the letter of credit facilities as at 31 December 2012 was 47.0 million US$76.4 million 2011: 215.4 million US$333.9 million.

The groups unutilised tax losses and allowances at 31 December 2012 are recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future against which the tax losses and allowances can be utilised.
In accordance with paragraph 37 of IAS 12 Income Taxes the group re-assessed its unrecognised deferred tax assets at 31 December 2012 with respect to ring fence tax losses and allowances.
The corporate model used to assess whether additional deferred tax assets should be recognised was re-run, using an oil price assumption of Dated Brent forward curve in 2013 and 2014, and US$85 bbl in real terms.
The results of the corporate model concluded that it was appropriate to recognise all of the groups UK ring fence deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses and allowances in full.
In addition to the above, there are non-ring fence UK tax losses of approximately US$327.6 million 2011: US$181.2 million and current year non-UK tax losses of approximately US$26.9 million 2011:$69.4 million for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
None of the UK tax losses ring fence and non-ring fence have a fixed expiry date for tax purposes.
No deferred tax has been provided on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, following a change in UK tax legislation in 2009 which exempted foreign dividends from the scope of UK corporation tax, where certain conditions are satisfied.
On 23 March 2011 it was announced that tax relief on decommissioning expenditure would be restricted to 50 per cent rather than 62 per cent.
This restriction was substantially enacted in the 2012 Finance Bill and has resulted in a deferred tax charge to the income statement of $27.2 million.
