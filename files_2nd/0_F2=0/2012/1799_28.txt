The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use.
Cash ow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each cash-generating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed and anticipated orders.
Cash ow forecasts for the next three years 2011: four years are based on the Groups 2013 budget and strategic roadmap.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
The revenue growth rates have been applied to cash ows after three years 2011: four years into perpetuity and have been derived from estimated GDP growth rates based on published data for the economic environment of each CGU less 1.0% to reect current economic uncertainties and their consequent estimated effect on public sector spending on infrastructure.
The cash ows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The cash ows have been discounted using CGU specic pre-tax discount rates of 9.0% to 13.7% 2011: 10.3% to 13.4%.
The discount rates are revised annually applying updated market inputs to the capital asset pricing model.

Following a strategic review in the light of low activity levels and the commoditisation of work, the Group has decided to divest all of its Mainland European rail businesses over time.
The residual goodwill in the CGU is 61m.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used.
The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the revenue growth rate.
Except as noted below, a reasonable possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
Following the impairment in Mainland European rail businesses using a discount rate of 9.2% and revenue growth rate of 2.5% the recoverable amount of goodwill is 61m based on value in use, with a consequent headroom of nil.
A 1.0% increase in the discount rate or a 1.0% reduction in the growth rate would lead to a further impairment of 16m or 13m respectively.
The recoverable amount of the Blackpool International Airport goodwill is 4m with headroom of nil, based on the value in use of thetrading business and the fair value of the land.
Any decrease in the fair value of the land will lead to a commensurate impairment ofthe goodwill.

Subsequently, the Finance Act 2012, which was enacted on 17 July 2012, reduced the main UK corporation tax rate by an additional 1% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and by a further 1% to 23% from 1 April 2013.
In 2012, the effect of the reduction in the UK tax rate reduced the Groups net deferred tax asset by 8m, with 3m being charged to the income statement and 5m being charged to equity.
In the 2012 Autumn Statement it was announced, although not enacted, that there will be a further 2% reduction in the main UK corporation tax rate to bring the rate down to 21% from 1 April 2014.
Should the future UK corporation tax rate reduction be enacted, based on the latest forecasts, this will give rise to a further reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset of 8m by 2014 with 3m being charged to the income statement and 5m being charged to equity.
At the reporting date, the Group had unrecognised tax losses that arose over a number of years of approximately 280m 2011: 273m which are available for offset against future profits.
22m 2011: 26m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2021.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the reporting date, the undistributed reserves for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 905m 2011: 924m in respect of subsidiaries and 128m 2011: 110m in respect of joint ventures and associates.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Groups control and no distribution which gives rise to taxation is contemplated.

Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 133 | Our Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements 26 Retirement benefit liabilities 26.1 Group The Group, through trustees, operates a number of dened contribution and dened benefit pension schemes.
Dened contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme andthe scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Dened benefit schemes are schemes other than dened contribution schemes and provide benets based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The majority of the Groups dened benefit schemes are funded.
Dened benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups main scheme is the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes dened contribution and dened benefit sections.
The dened benefit sections are closed to new members with the exception of employees where employment has transferred to the Group under certain agreed arrangements.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group made a pension increase exchange PIE offer to certain current pensioners, widows and widowers of the BBPF to forego their entitlement to future non-statutory inationary increases in return for a higher pension than their current entitlement.
At 31 December 2011, 509 members had accepted the PIE offer, resulting in a 2m reduction inobligations and a consequential past service cost credit of 2m in 2011.
The offer closed in February 2012 resulting in an additional 2m reduction to the pension liability and a consequential net past service cost credit of 2m in 2012.
Following the formal triennial funding valuation of the BBPF carried out as at 31 March 2010, the Group agreed to certain one-off deficit funding contributions and to increase the amount of ongoing deficit payments to the BBPF to 48m per annum from April 2010, increasing each year by CPI capped at 5% plus 50% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
In December 2011 a one-off deficit funding contribution of 55m was made.
In anticipation of the formal triennial funding valuation as at 31 March 2013, the Group has agreed to make additional conditional deficit contributions of 1m per month, payable quarterly in arrears, if the BBPF funding levels in any given month are below certain funding targets set out in the BBPF journey plan.
The first payment was made in January 2013.
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth tomeet, together with contributions from the Group, the cost of current and future benets.
The BBPF invests partly in a diversied range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the obligations.
The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market and emerging market equities.
The remaining BBPF assets are principally xed and index-linked bonds and swaps in order to match the duration and ination exposure of the obligations and enhance the resilience of the funding level of the scheme.
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.
On 21 December 2011, the BBPF acquired the Groups effective 25.5% interest in Barking Power Ltd at its carrying value of 55m.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operated a dened benefit scheme which has been closed to newmembers Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme since 31 July 2003.
On 28 June 2012 the Parson Brinckerhoff Scheme released its legal charge over a Group leasehold property with a book value of 4m at 31 December 2011 in return for a one-off deficit contribution of 2.5m.
On 30 June 2012 the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme merged with the BBPF and agreed to make additional deficit payments of 11m per annum to the BBPF, with the first payment made in October 2012.
Certain Group employees are members of the Balfour Beatty Shared Cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme Railways Pension Scheme, which is closed to new members with the exception of employees transferring under certain agreed arrangements.
The economic interest of the Group in this shared cost scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities, based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit nancing.
Active members continue to accrue benets for future service.
Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed to newentrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 17.1 in a trust, the assets of which are for the ultimate benefit of the employees but are available tothe Groups creditors in the event of insolvency.
In the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group reassessed the difference between the RPI and CPI measures of price ination from 0.50% to 0.90%.
The increase was applied following consideration of research published by the Ofce for National Statistics ONS and independent advice received from the Groups actuaries as a consequence of the Occupational Pensions Revaluation Order 2010 published by the UK Government on 30 November 2010.
These changes in assumptions gave rise to a 35m actuarial reduction in liabilities which was credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income.
In the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group reassessed the difference between the RPI and CPI measures of price ination from 0.90% to 0.70%.
The reduction was applied following further consideration of proposals made by the ONS to change the method to calculate RPI and independent advice received from the Groups actuaries.
This change in assumptions gave rise to a 25m actuarial increase in liabilities which was charged to equity in the statement of comprehensive income.

Obligations are calculated using theprojected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on a high quality corporate bond.
The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected return on plan assets and the interest on scheme obligations is included in finance charges.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation is set out in Note 26.2.
A different calculation is used for the formal triennial funding valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme obligations.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the obligations are discounted using a rate of return reecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal funding basis valuations are set out in Note 26.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include anydirect holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of the Group.

The actuary is also able to monitor changes in the exhibited mortality over time.
This research is taken into account in the Groups mortality assumptions across its various dened benefit schemes.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 December 2012 have been updated to reect the experience of Balfour Beatty pensioners for the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 2012.

The maximum amount that the Group could be required to pay or receive under the terms of the contingent consideration arrangements is: 11m payable or 16m receivable in respect of Parsons Brinckerhoff: 9m payable in respect of Howard S. Wright: 3m payable in respect of SpawMaxwell: and 1m payable in respect of Subsurface.
In addition to the amounts shown above, at 31 December 2012 2m 2011: 4m and 1m 2011: 1m relating to the acquisitions ofPower efficiency and Ofce Projects respectively are held in escrow to be paid in 2013 subject to certain provisions of the purchaseagreement.
30.3 Prior year acquisitions The fair values of the acquired assets and liabilities disclosed as provisional at 31 December 2011 in respect of Fru-Con Construction LLC and Howard S. Wright were nalised during 2012, giving rise to a decrease in both goodwill and amounts due to construction contract customers of 1m which is disclosed in the current year.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities previously disclosed as provisional at 31 December 2011 have been nalised with no material changes.
1 On 1 February 2012, the Group disposed of its 50% interest in the shares and loan notes issued by Transform Schools North Lanarkshire Holdings Ltd for a cash consideration of 18m.

The other shareholders in HMU exercised pre-emption provisions in the shareholders agreement and the disposal was completed on 11 July 2012.
As a consequence of the disposal, 2m was donated to the UCLH Charity and treated as a cost of disposal.
This donation would not have taken place had the disposal of HMU not taken place.
Additional transaction costs of 1m were incurred in respect of the disposal.
The disposal resulted in a net gain of 44m being recognised within underlying operating profit, comprising a gain of 6m in respect of the disposal of the investment in the joint venture and a 38m gain in respect of revaluation reserves recycled to the income statement.
1 On 3 May 2011, the Group disposed of its UK specialist rail manufacturing business for 37m.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises withthe Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specic areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
150 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Our Accounts | Our Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements 36 Financial instruments continued 36.2 Group continued a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: t forward foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company t interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash ow variability in PPP concessions arising from variable interest rates on borrowings.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks since 2011. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirate dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
At31December 2012 no individual entities within the Group had material financial assets or liabilities in a functional currency other than their own.
GroupTreasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange riskabove pre-set materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial officer whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure isidentied with sufficient reliability.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions.
Refer to page 149 for details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures.
As at 31 December 2012, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 274m 2011: 116m receivable and 287m 2011: 116m payable.
The period during which the cash ows are expected to occur is up to five 2011: three years and this will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts with a notional principal amount of 21m 2011: 26m receivable and 23m 2011: 26m payable as cash ow hedges against highly probable capital expenditure which is expected to occur in up to four 2011:three years.
Fair value gains on these contracts of nil 2011: nil have been taken to hedging reserves within equity.
Thecumulative amounts deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash ow hedges at the reporting date is nil 2011: nil.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks.
The Groups policy was amended in prior years and at the reporting date the Group no longer entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated net assets.
Since 2009 no translation risk has been hedged.
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash ow hedges.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
At the reporting date there had been no change to the hedging policies since 2011.
InMarch 2013 the Group raised US$350m through a US private placement which has been designated as a net investment hedge.
Refer to Note 35. ii Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk arises in the Groups PPP concessions which borrow funds at both oating and xed interest rates and hold availablefor-sale financial assets.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy to manage this risk is to swap oating rate interest to xed rate, usinginterest rate swap contracts.
In an interest rate swap, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between xed and oating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash ows using the applicable yield curve at the reporting date.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2012 and 2011, the Groups PPP subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2012 totalled 404m 2011: 365m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 24 years.
At31December 2012, the xed interest rates range from 4.2% to 5.1% 2011: 4.2% to 5.1% and the principal oating rates are LIBOR plusa xed margin.
ii Interest rate risk management continued A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 8m 2011: 19m increase 9m 2011: 21m decrease in amounts taken directly to equity by the Group in relation to the Groups exposure tointerest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash ow hedges of its PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a nil 2011: 1m increase 2m 2011: nil decrease in the Groups net investment income.
Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 151 | Our Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements 36 Financial instruments continued 36.2 Group continued a Market risk continued iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of ination on the concessions costs.
To the extent that ination differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of only using counterparties that are independently rated with a minimum long term credit rating of BBB.
At 31 December 2012 37m 2011: 28m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances, however no losses are anticipated from these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation ofthese credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
TheGroups most significant customers are public or regulated sector entities which generally have high credit ratings or areofa high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 24.1.
The maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities is set out on page 150.
Fair value estimation The Group holds a number of financial instruments on the statement of financial position at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1 The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued at the closing market price at 31 December.
Level 2 The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows utilising yield curves at the reporting date.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates atthe reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Level 3 The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin that reects the fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash ows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is basedon long term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets.
The consequent movement in the fair value is taken to equity.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.

The Companys external forward foreign exchange contracts hedge the currency risk on foreign currency loans entered into with Group companies or are offset by forward foreign exchange contracts with the Groups operating companies where Group Treasury is hedging the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities ontheir behalf.
ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to an 8m 2011: 5m increase decrease in the Companys net finance cost.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to UK interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The Company bears credit risk in respect to trade and other receivables and payables due from to subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due atthe reporting date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

158 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Our Accounts | Our Accounts Notes to the Financial Statements 37 Principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates continued e Balfour Beatty Investments US PPP concessions Military housing Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number ofUS military privatisation projects associated with a total of 47 US government military bases which includes 47 military family housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that are expected to contain approximately 37,000 housing units once development, construction and renovation have been completed.
The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, five projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project with the Army at Fort Stewart.
Contractual arrangements The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : the Air Force is not a named partner or member inBalfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, however it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the ProjectLLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash ows of the Project LLC.
On each project, the Project LLC entersinto a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, aswell as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, potentially could extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual, minimum preferred rateof return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts will generally accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, atthe end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the government in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
Allocation of remaining operating cash ows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash ow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment accountheld bythe project for the benefit of the government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modied rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, onits initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modied rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military service.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions willhave the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and acomplete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the applicable military service.
