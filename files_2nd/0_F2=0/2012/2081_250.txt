Aluminium and Nickel In FY2012, we consolidated our Stainless Steel Materials and Aluminium businesses into a single Customer Sector Glenn Kellow Group CSG, to provide the appropriate scale within the President, Aluminium and Nickel BHP Billiton portfolio.
US$ million Aluminium Record annual production at the Alumar refinery, Brazil, Revenue 4,766 contributed to a four per cent increase in total alumina Underlying EBIT 291 production in FY2012.
Metal production was lower as potline Capital expenditure 852 capacity at Hillside in South Africa was temporarily curtailed Net operating assets 8,560 following a major unplanned outage in the March 2012 quarter.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$557 million to a loss of US$291 million as weaker prices and cost escalation The Worsley Efficiency and Growth drove significant margin compression.
An eight per cent reduction in the average realised price of aluminium to US$2,314 per tonne project delivered first production and a three per cent decline in the average realised price of alumina to US$333 per tonne reduced Underlying EBIT by US$245 million, net of price-linked costs.
Higher raw material costs for inputs such as coke and caustic soda led to a further US$223 million decline in Underlying EBIT.
Costs associated with the Hillside outage added to the decline.
The Worsley Efficiency and Growth project delivered first production during FY2012.
US$ million Stainless Steel Materials The successful replacement of the Line 1 furnace at Cerro Revenue 2,993 Matoso in Colombia in the September 2011 quarter led to an Underlying EBIT 32 increase in annual nickel production.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 Capital expenditure 513 decreased by US$556 million to US$32 million.
A 22 per cent Net operating assets 3,122 decline in the average realised nickel price reduced Underlying EBIT by US$584 million, net of price-linked costs.
At Nickel West, Mt Keith, a reduction in mining activity and the commissioning Tangible cost benefits delivered of the Talc Redesign project delivered tangible cost benefits during the period.
