88 Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 28.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared under historic cost accounting rules and in accordance with UK GAAP.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
No Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses is required under UK GAAP as it is treated as related to the profit and loss account.
Actuarial movements and related deferred tax will therefore only appear in the reserves note.
The Company is exempt from the requirement of FRS1 Cash Flow Statements to prepare a cash ow statement on the grounds that the Company isconsolidated in the Group consolidated financial statements.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost, less estimated net realisable value, of tangible xed assets on a straight-line basis over theexpected useful economic lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Ofce equipment between 10% and 20% Computer equipment between 20% and 33.3% Plant, machinery, xtures and ttings between 10% and 20% Motor vehicles between 25% and 33.3% Leased assets The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered byaforward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling atthebalance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost, less provisions for impairment in value.
Where the consideration forthe acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking includes shares in the Company to which the provisions of Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 apply, the cost represents the nominal value of shares issued together with the fair value of any additional consideration given and costs.
Pension contributions The Company operates both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
The assets of all the arrangements are held separately from the assets ofthe Company in independently administered funds.
The amount charged against profits in respect of dened contribution arrangements are the contributions payable to those arrangements in the accounting period.
For the dened benefit arrangements the assets are measured at market values.
The liabilities are measured using the projected unit method, discounting at the current rate of return of a high quality corporate bond of the appropriate term and currency tothe liability, asrequired under FRS 17.
The dened benefit scheme surplus or deficit is recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The movement in the deficit is split between operating charges, nancing items and actuarial gains and losses in the statement ofrecognised gains and losses.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately recognised and are nolonger at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed inthenotes to the financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet approximates to fair value.
com Financials Dialight plc Annual report and accounts 2012 89 28.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The PSP allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over theperiod during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to receive the awards.
The fair value of the awards granted ismeasured using a pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual number of share awards that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants awards over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, it recognised an increase in the cost ofinvestment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
