The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
As further explained below, the most significant effect on the financial statements from accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of research and development R&D, and revenue.
The major judgements made in respect of R&D are those in assessing whether an intangible asset arises from the development phase of a product development project, i. e. : i The technical feasibility of completing the product so it will be ready for sale ii The market for the product and the future sales that the product will generate iii Assessing the costs directly attributable to the individual product during its development.
The Group has a very wide product range and the general nature of product development is that of a number of modest sized projects.
The value of capitalised development costs is disclosed in note 13.
The judgements used in respect of revenue are explained in the revenue accounting policy on page 93 below.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key areas where estimates have been used and assumptions applied are in provisions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, and in assessing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
More details of the estimates used and assumptions applied in relation to impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 13 and those in relation to assessing defined benefit scheme liabilities in note 27.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information on the Groups business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital structure and cash flow are included in the business review and financial review on pages 17 to 29.
In addition, note 31 to the financial statements discloses details of the Groups financial risk management and credit facilities.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
There were no revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2012 which had a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
There are a number of new standards, amended standards and interpretations that are not yet effective for the year ended 31st December 2012, but that will be effective for 2013.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amends the presentation of Other Comprehensive Income to require items to be presented on the basis of whether subsequently they are potentially reclassifiable to the Income Statement.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits requires the financing on post-retirement benefits to be calculated on the net surplus or deficit using an AA corporate bond rate and all administrative and investment expenses to be recognised in the Income Statement.
This will be effective for 2013 and will require restatement of the 2012 comparative figures, the effect of which is illustrated in note 27 on page 109.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
90 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategy and performance Sustainability Governance Financial statements 91 1 Accounting policies continued Basis of accounting i Subsidiaries The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The accounts include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the accounts.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
iv Company Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
Foreign currency i On consolidation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Where the notes to the Group accounts include tables reconciling movements between opening and closing balances, assets and liabilities are translated at balance sheet rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates with the exchange differences arising being disclosed separately.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a separate translation reserve within equity.
They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the Cash flow hedge reserve.
The associated gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The principal rates are as follows: Freehold buildings 1.5% Office equipment 12.533.3% Plant and machinery 1012.5% Motor vehicles 20% Office furniture and fittings 10% Tooling and patterns 10% The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 91 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see note 13 for more detail.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP.
ii R&D Expenditure on R&D is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that development expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits.
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related expenses.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
iii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
Annual impairment tests are performed on acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value with the recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, of future cash flows in respect of intangible assets for the relevant cash generating unit.
More detail is given in note 13. iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date they are available for use.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The principal amortisation rates are as follows: Capitalised development costs 20% Manufacturing designs and core technology 10% ERP systems and software 12.520% Non compete undertakings 50% Customer relationships 20% Brand names and trademarks 1020% Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity usually of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statements.
Going concern The statement on the going concern assumption is included within corporate governance on page 82.
Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations to determine its present value.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year they arise.
Any scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit is recognised in full in the balance sheet.
The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
iii Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes.
The fair value of these options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options and share awards vesting.
iv Long-term share incentive plans The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance conditions.
92 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategy and performance Sustainability Governance Financial statements 93 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is typically on delivery.
For service contracts, revenue is recognised at the point of customer acceptance.
Revenue from projects is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
Judgements can be required to assess the stage of completion, although in the vast majority of projects the position is relatively easy to identify.
Projects where a stage of completion assessment is needed typically involve the sale of products, installation and commissioning, which are usually separately identified elements in the project order.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or there is the possibility of return of the goods.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods.
As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract.
An expected loss on a project or service contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Leases i Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
ii Finance leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital and interest elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability.
Taxation The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share options granted to subsidiary employees The Parent Company grants share options over its own Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies.
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies.
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies.
This is accounted for as an increase in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.

The UK corporation tax charge is calculated after deducting tax allowable deficit reduction cash contributions to the UK postretirement benefit schemes of 7,500,000 2011: 7,900,000 covering all employees in the UK defined benefit schemes.
The Governments autumn statement on 5th December 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 21% by 2014.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1st April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5th July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1st April 2012 and 23% effective from 1st April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26th March 2012 and 3rd July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31st December 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Companys deferred tax asset accordingly.
No UK tax after double tax relief for underlying tax is expected to be payable on the future remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries.

These have been estimated using cash flows based on forecast information for the next financial year which has been approved by the Board and in the case of recent acquisitions on detailed annual forecasts The key assumptions on which the impairment tests are based are the discount and growth rates and the forecast cash flows Pre-tax discount rates range from 1013% Growth rates vary between 3-10% depending on detailed forecasts No impairments were identified as a result of this exercise.
The principal value in use assumptions for the Spirax-Sarco Mexicana S A goodwill balance were as follows: Long-term revenue growth of 56% Pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
The principal value in use assumptions for the Flexicon A S Denmark goodwill balance were as follows: Long-term revenue growth of 45% Pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
The principal value in use assumptions for the MasoSine goodwill balance were as follows: Long-term revenue growth of 2.53.5% Pre-tax discount rate of 13%.
Sensitivity analysis shows that if long-term revenue growth assumptions are lowered by 1% and pre-tax discount rates raised by 1%, no impairment would arise.

108 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategy and performance Sustainability Governance Financial statements 109 27 Employee benefits Pension plans The Group The Group is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Groups Defined Benefit Obligations.
Other plans operated by the Group were either Defined Contribution plans or were deemed immaterial for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
The total expense relating to the Groups Defined Contribution pension plans in the current year was 6,832,000 2011: 6,809,000.
Of the Defined Benefit plans, the plans in the UK and USA hold most of the liability.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of these plans may therefore be considered material.
The main UK scheme assumes that post-retirement mortality follows the SAPS standard tables, with improvements based on the 2009 CMI Core Projections with a 1.5% long-term trend.
This basis gives a life expectancy of 23 years and 25 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of increased longevity.
The USA schemes use the RP-2000 BC mortality table with AA scale projected for 12 years.
Life expectancy under this table is 18 years and 20 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.

On adoption the interest cost and expected return on assets disclosed in the Income Statement for all defined benefit pension plans will be based on discount rate assumptions.
This is different from the IAS 19 standard used in these financial statements IAS revised 2008 which uses discount rates to set the interest cost, but a return on assets assumption to calculate the expected return on assets.
If IAS 19 revised 2011 had been used in the 2012 financial statements, the expected return on assets recognised in the Group Income Statement would have been 3,559,000 lower at 12,418,000.
The treatment of administrative and investment expenses under IAS 19 revised 2011 will also change.
If IAS 19 revised 2011 had been used for the 2012 financial statements the current service charge cost recognised in the Group Income Statement would have been 114,000 higher at 7,306,000.
The changes under IAS 19 revised 2011 described above have no impact on the post-retirement benefits liability that is recognised in the Group Statement of Financial Position.
