111 The tax credit for the year is different to the credit for the year derived by applying the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 25% 2011: 27% to the loss profit before tax.
The differences are explained below: 2012 2011 m m Loss profit before tax 1.7 26.1 Loss profit before tax at a rate of 25% 2011: 27% 0.4 7.0 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.1 1.8 Goodwill credit not taxable 3.8 Impact of tax rate change 0.2 0.8 Other losses and non-taxable items 0.1 0.7 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 2.9 16.5 2.1 13.0 As shown above, deferred tax has been taken directly to other comprehensive income in relation to the actuarial gain or loss on the BPT Limited pension scheme, the equity component of available-for-sale financial assets and the fair value movement in cash flow hedges and exchange adjustments.
The tax effect is shown separately within the statement of other comprehensive income on page 77.
Factors that may affect future tax charges In addition to the changes in rates of Corporation Tax disclosed above, a number of changes to the UK Corporation Tax system are proposed.
A further reduction in the main rate was proposed in the Autumn Statement on 5 December 2012 to reduce the rate to 21% from 1 April 2014.
This change has not been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date and, therefore, is not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes expected to be enacted would be to reduce the deferred tax asset provided at the statement of financial position date by 0.5m.
This 0.5m reduction in the deferred tax asset would reduce profit by 0.2m and decrease other comprehensive income by 0.3m.
16 Dividends Under IAS 10, final dividends are excluded from the statement of financial position either until they are approved by the company in general meeting or until they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the companys discretion.
Dividends paid in the year are shown below: 2012 2011 m m Ordinary dividends on equity shares: Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2010 1.20p per share 4.9 Final dividend for the year ended 30 September 2011 1.30p per share 5.3 Interim dividend for the year ended 30 September 2012 0.55p per share 2.3 7.6 4.9 A final dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2012 of 1.37p per share amounting to 5.6m will be proposed at the 2013 AGM.

The 2012 interim dividend of 0.55p per share was paid in July 2012.
This gives a total dividend for 2012 of 1.92p per share 2011: 1.83p per share.
