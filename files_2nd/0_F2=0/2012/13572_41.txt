19 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For the UK defined benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.
