Subsidiaries and associates a Adoption of IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, IFRS 11, Joint arrangements and IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other entities As stated in note 1, the Group has early adopted the accounting requirements of IFRS 10 and IFRS 11 and the disclosure requirements of IFRS 12 in this set of financial statements.
In accordance with these standards, the changes in accounting policy have been applied retrospectively and the comparative financial information has been restated accordingly.
The Group has not presented a balance sheet for the beginning of the earliest comparative period as required by IAS 1 because the impact is not material.
The amount of the adjustment for each financial statement line item affected is presented below: As reported Restated 2011 Restatement 2011 Consolidated income statement m m m Other operating expenses 263.0 0.4 263.4 Total expenses 643.2 0.4 643.6 Results of operating activities 165.9 0.4 166.3 Finance costs 27.8 0.4 27.4 Loss before tax 193.8 193.8 As reported Restated 2011 Restatement 2011 Consolidated balance sheet m m m Cash and cash equivalents 256.4 0.1 256.3 Financial assets 4,080.4 96.5 3,983.9 Total assets 6,502.1 96.6 6,405.5 Other payables, including insurance and reinsurance payables: - other payables 118.5 0.9 117.6 Borrowings 388.5 95.7 292.8 Total liabilities 5,081.7 96.6 4,985.1 Total equity, reserves and liabilities 6,502.1 96.6 6,405.5 Consequential amendments have also been made to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes to the accounts.
The impact of the restatement has had no effect on the previously reported amounts of basic and diluted earnings per share.
b Significant judgements in determining control The Group has made significant judgements and assumptions in reaching its control conclusions for the following entities: i.
Investment funds The Group holds financial investments in a number of pooled vehicles, which are typically sub-funds of umbrella structures.
In certain instances the Group holds a majority of the voting rights in particular sub-funds.
The Group has determined that it neither controls nor significantly influences these sub-funds despite owning a majority of the voting rights on the basis that direction of the relevant activities of the sub-funds is by the umbrella vehicle, over which the Group has no significant rights.
Such entities are accounted for as financial investments in accordance with IAS 39. ii.
Leadenhall Capital Partners LLP LCP The Group holds 50.0% of the voting rights in LCP.
Owing to the Groups contractual commitments to LCP, as detailed below, and its interests in the funds managed by LCP, the Group has assessed whether it has fide facto control over the entity.
The Group has determined that it does not have controlling power over LCP as significant decision making requires the consent of more than one party to the arrangement and LCP is therefore collectively controlled.
However, such significant decisions do not require the unanimous consent of all the controlling parties and therefore LCP does not meet the definition of a joint arrangement under IFRS 11.
The Group is therefore considered to have significant influence over LCP and its interest is accounted for as an investment in associate using the equity method accordingly.
LCP was previously accounted for as a joint venture using the equity method.
The contractual terms of the Groups interest in LCP have not changed and the impact is one of disclosure only.
