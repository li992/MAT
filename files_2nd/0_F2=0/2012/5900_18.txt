Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP.
The Group financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements are disclosed in note 2.
The following standards or interpretations to existing standards have been adopted for the first time during the year: IAS 24 Revised Related Party Disclosures Amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The following standards or interpretations to existing standards have been published but are not mandatory for the year ended 31 August 2012 and consequently have not been adopted by the Group in the year: Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits IAS 27 Revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine None of these standards or interpretations are expected to have a significant impact on the Groups reported results or financial position.
At 31 August 2012, the Group presented deferred taxation balances on a net basis where there is a legally enforceable right of offset of current tax and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Previously these have been presented gross.
The 2011 comparatives in the consolidated balance sheet and related notes have been reclassified, resulting in a reduction in both deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities of 7.5m.
There was no impact on net assets, cash flows or the consolidated income statement.
Further details can be found in note 15.
At 31 August 2012, the Group presented derivative financial instruments in their constituent parts as net investments hedges or cash flow hedges and as non-current or current as applicable.
Previously the net amount has been presented within non-current liabilities.
The 2011 comparatives in the consolidated balance sheet and related notes have been reclassified, resulting in an increase in non-current assets of 4.7m, current assets of 0.1m and non-current liabilities of 7.2m and a reduction in non-current liabilities of 2.4m.
Further details can be found in note 23.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 63 Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Overview Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the financial statements of Fenner PLC and subsidiaries controlled by the Group as at 31 August each year.
a Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group at the date of completion.
Costs directly attributable to the acquisition are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
The subsidiarys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, the accounting policies of acquired subsidiaries are adjusted to bring them into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of acquisition and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
b Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity.
The Groups interest in associates is incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method.
Investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of investments.
Losses of associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Where a Group entity transacts with an associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that entity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentation currency The individual financial statements of each entity in the Group are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates the functional currency.
The Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the presentation currency of the Group.
b Transactions and balances Transactions in currencies other than an entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items measured at historical cost are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement and retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement in the period.
c Net investment in foreign operations For the consolidation of operations where the functional currency is different to the Groups presentation currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised directly in equity in the exchange reserve.
On disposal of such operations, the cumulative exchange differences are included in the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are retranslated at the closing rate at each balance sheet date.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to not apply this to goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer, principally on despatch on domestic sales and in accordance with shipping terms for export sales.
Revenue from short-term service contracts is recognised in the period in which the services are completed.
Interest income relates to bank interest or similar income and is recognised on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 64 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment at the lower of their fair value at the inception of the lease and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are recognised in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Government grants Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income in the balance sheet and are recognised in the income statement over the expected useful life of the relevant asset.
Government grants in respect of revenue expenditure are recognised in the income statement in the period in which the related expenditure is incurred.
Share-based payments The Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes for certain employees.
The cost of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at fair value at the date of grant, excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
The cost is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with the corresponding amount credited to equity, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair values are measured using the Binomial optionpricing model and the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
The cost of cash-settled share-based payments is measured as per the equity-settled payments, except that it is recalculated at each subsequent reporting date.
In addition, the corresponding amount is credited to trade and other payables instead of equity.
Post-retirement benefits The Group operates various pension schemes.
The schemes are funded through trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For defined benefit schemes, the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Current service costs are recognised in the income statement.
Net finance costs or income are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution schemes, payments are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Some Group companies provide post-retirement healthcare benefits to their retirees.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension schemes.
These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to recognise in full the cumulative actuarial gains and losses at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income and expense that are material and relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance and may be operating or non-operating in nature.
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, such items are presented separately on the face of the income statement and analysed in the notes to the financial statements.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 65 Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Overview Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is the tax expected to be payable on taxable profit for the period using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustments in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are not taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, unless specifically exempt.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
The resulting charge or credit is recognised in the income statement except when it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the charge or credit is also recognised directly in equity.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board are recognised in the financial statements when they have been approved by shareholders at the AGM.
Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Segmental reporting Segmental information is reported in a manner consistent with the information provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
This information is used for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
The Group has adopted the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 to record the previously revalued freehold land and buildings as deemed cost at 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation on other assets is recognised in the income statement to write down the value of the asset to its residual value on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset from the date it is brought into use.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings Unexpired term of lease Plant, machinery and equipment 3-10 years Assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Any excess of the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired entity over cost is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying amount of the investment.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 September 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, has been recorded at the previous UK GAAP carrying amount at that date, subject to any impairment required at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 continues to be included in reserves and is not included in any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 66 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value.
Other intangible assets are initially recognised at cost.
Intangible assets are subsequently stated at fair value or cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset.
Estimated useful lives most widely applied are as follows: Computer software 3-5 years Order book within 1 year Brands and trademarks 5-20 years Leases 5-7 years Customer relationships 5-16 years Technology based assets 5 years Non-compete agreements 5 years Impairment The carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill is allocated to those cash-generative units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss previously been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit.
Any reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value with allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial assets Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
a Trade receivables Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for goods sold or services performed in the ordinary course of business.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
b Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts as they are an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
a Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services acquired from suppliers in the ordinary course of business.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 67 Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Overview b Borrowings Bank loans and overdrafts and other loans are initially measured at fair value less direct arrangement fees and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign currency contracts, options, interest rate and currency swaps and nonderivative cash instruments, including foreign currency borrowings, to hedge its exposure to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting or the ineffective portion of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges are recognised in the income statement as they are incurred.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss in equity is transferred to the income statement in the period.
Provisions Provisions in respect of restructuring costs, property and environmental costs, contingent and deferred consideration on acquisition and redemption liability on acquisitions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a suitable pre-tax rate which matches the maturity of and risks associated with that liability.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Equity instruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received net of directly attributable issue costs.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make certain assumptions, estimates and judgements that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These are based on historical experience and any other factors, including expectations of future events, that are considered appropriate and these are continually reviewed.
Subsequent actual results may however differ from these estimates and judgements.
Areas where assumptions, estimates and judgements may give rise to risk of material adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are as follows: Taxation The Group is subject to taxation in various jurisdictions and uncertainties exist over the interpretation of the respective tax regulations and the ultimate determination by the tax authorities in those jurisdictions.
Taxation is calculated based on the best estimates of amounts expected to be due.
Where the final tax determination is different to the amounts initially recorded, they are subsequently adjusted in the period in which such determination is made.
Deferred taxation is recognised based on the estimated likelihood that future taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be utilised.
Impairment of goodwill Impairment testing for the carrying amount of goodwill is based on estimated recoverable amounts of cash-generating units, based on value in use calculations.
This is calculated using cash flow projections based on financial forecasts for a period of three years and, thereafter, extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
Cash flows are discounted using the Groups pre-tax cost of capital after adjusting for a country risk premium, estimated to reflect the risk profiles in the respective territories.
Inventory provisions The provision for inventory write downs is based on managements estimate of the net realisable value of inventories.
Impairment of trade receivables Impairment of trade receivables is based on managements estimate of the recoverability of receivable amounts.
This is based on a variety of factors including past default experience.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations are based on actuarial valuations that use a number of assumptions.
These include the discount rate, which is based on the interest rate of high quality corporate bonds denominated in the currency of the benefits and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related obligation, expected rates of return on assets, inflation rates, expected salary increases and mortality.
Provisions Provisions represent managements best estimate of expenditure required to settle obligations existing at the balance sheet date.
For certain obligations within contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions and redemption liability on acquisitions, payments are contingent on the future performance of acquired businesses and this is estimated based on financial forecasts.
Where material, obligations are discounted using suitable rates based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted.
Segment information IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal management reporting.
For the purposes of managing the business, the Group is organised into two reportable segments: Engineered Conveyor Solutions and Advanced Engineered Products.
Engineered Conveyor Manufacture of rubber ply, solid woven and steel cord conveyor belting for mining, power Solutions generation and industrial applications with complementary service operations which design, install, monitor, maintain and operate conveyor systems for mining customers.
Advanced Engineered Manufacture of precision polymer products including: Products - precision drives for computer peripherals, copiers and ATMs: - problem-solving power transmission and motion transfer components: - silicone and complex hoses for heavy duty trucks, buses and off-road vehicles: - seals and sealing solutions for the fluid power and oil and gas industries: - technical textiles for medical and industrial applications and silicone based products for medical applications: - rollers for digital image processing and medical diagnostics: and - fluropolymer components for fluid and gas handling.
Operating segments within these reportable segments have been aggregated where they have similar economic characteristics with similar products and services, production processes, methods of distribution and customer types.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for the purpose of IFRS 8 is the Board of Directors.
The financial position of the segments is reported to the CODM on a monthly basis and this information is used to assess the performance of the Group and to allocate resources on an appropriate basis.
Segment performance is reviewed down to the operating profit level.
Financing costs and taxation are managed on a Group basis so these costs are not allocated to operating segments.
Transfer prices on inter-segment revenues are on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Current taxation in equity relates to a credit of 0.6m 2011: nil in respect of share-based payments recognised in transactions with owners.
In the UK, the Finance Act 2012, which was substantively enacted on 17 July 2012, included legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 25% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and to 23% from 1 April 2013.
This change has been reflected in these financial statements, resulting in a 0.7m charge to equity and a 0.1m charge to the income statement.
A further reduction to the main rate is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The overall effect of the further changes from 23% to 22%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 August 2012, would be to reduce deferred tax assets by 0.4m.

All intangible assets have finite useful lives except for goodwill.
The remaining useful lives at 31 August 2012 are approximately 11 to 16 years in respect of brands and trademarks, 2 to 14 years in respect of customer relationships and 4 years in respect of non-compete agreements.
The impairment charge on goodwill relates to Xeridiem.
The impairment review was triggered by a reduction in the projected cash flows in that cash-generating unit and resulted in an impairment in the Half Yearly Financial Report.
This is classified within administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 76 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 13.
Intangible assets continued Impairment testing for goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the Groups cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units as follows: 2012 2011 m m Engineered Conveyor Solutions Fenner Dunlop Americas, Europe and Australia 14.3 14.3 Conveyor Belting India 2.0 2.0 Fenner Dunlop Conveyor Services Americas 13.7 13.4 Spliceline 1.0 1.0 Northern Belting Specialists 2.7 2.7 BBCS LECS 12.4 12.5 Statewide Belting Service 5.5 5.5 Advanced Engineered Products Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Process 16.0 15.7 Fenner Advanced Sealing Technologies Fluid Power 28.2 28.7 Dawson Hose UK 2.2 2.2 Fenner Drives US 3.4 3.3 Prodesco 7.1 6.9 Fenner Precision Buffalo 2.9 2.9 Xeridiem 1.5 3.3 Multiseals 0.9 1.0 Transeals 3.7 - Allison 4.4 - 121.9 115.4 The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flow projections.
The key assumptions used to determine the value in use relate to profits derived from sales volumes, selling prices and costs, growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
Cash flow projections are based on financial forecasts for a period of three years which have been approved by Group management.
The principal components of these forecasts: sales volumes, selling prices and costs, are based on recent history and expected future changes in operating conditions.
Cash flows beyond a period of three years are extrapolated using estimated growth rates in the respective territories.
These rates range from 0.3% to 3.8% for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 7.3% has been applied.
Cash flows are discounted using the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital after adjusting for a country risk premium.
A range of discount rates between 9.4% to 11.8% were used for all cash-generating units except for Conveyor Belting India where a rate of 14.1% was used.
The discount rates reflect the risk profiles in the respective territories.
The above assumptions apply to all of the Groups cash-generating units.
At 31 August 2012, there is significant headroom between the value in use calculation and the carrying value for all of the cash-generating units in the above table except for Xeridiem which was impaired during the year.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset of current tax and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of certain tax losses amounting to 0.3m 2011: 1.1m since it is not envisaged that such profits will be available in the foreseeable future.
In addition, deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of UK capital losses of 0.4m 2011: 0.4m since it is not envisaged that suitable capital gains will be available in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate of temporary differences in respect of this is 1.0m 2011: 0.8m.

Financial risk management In the normal course of business, the Group is exposed to certain financial risks, principally foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks are managed by the central treasury function in conjunction with the operating units, in accordance with risk management policies that are designed to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on financial performance.
The policies are reviewed and approved by the Board.
Foreign exchange risk The Group has operations around the world and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in foreign operations.
Where cost effective, the exposures arising from the translation of the net assets of the Groups foreign operations are managed through the use of borrowings or cross-currency swaps in the relevant foreign currency.
Some Group operations also enter into commercial transactions in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Exposures arising from the translation of foreign currency transactions are continually monitored and material exposures are managed through the use of forward contracts or options once cash flows can be identified with sufficient certainty.
Exposures arising from the translation of intra-group lending are managed through the use of borrowings in the relevant foreign currency.
The following table shows the impact due to the retranslation of non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities in the Group's operations of a, reasonably possible, 10% movement in the Groups principal foreign currency exchange rates at the year end date.

The eff ect on shareholders equity is due to the effect on profit as well as the effect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies qualified as either cash fl ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Further details of the currency profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 81 Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Overview Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate risk arises on floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
This is reviewed regularly and is managed through the use of an appropriate mix of fixed rate and floating rate instruments, including the use of interest rate swaps, in response to market conditions.
The impact of interest rate risk on the Group's result is due to changes in interest rates on net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings.
At 31 August 2012, if interest rates on the Group's net floating rate cash and cash equivalents and borrowings had been 100 basis points higher, a reasonably possible movement, with all other variables held constant, the effect on profit before taxation in the year would have been a credit of 0.8m 2011: 0.8m.
A reduction of 100 basis points would have the equal and opposite effect.
There is no further impact on shareholders' equity.
Further details of the interest rate profile of borrowings are given in note 22.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk to ensure that sufficient resources are available for both short-term working capital and longer-term strategic requirements.
This is achieved through an appropriate mix of long and short-term borrowings and, as far as possible, the major part of the Groups total borrowings are managed so that they are drawn down using committed debt facilities which would not mature for at least one year.
The Groups principal loan facilities are raised and managed centrally but are supplemented by local overdraft and working capital facilities.
Committed debt facilities principally comprise bank loans and private placements.
The Group regularly monitors expected cash flows against availability of financing.
Regular updating of business forecasts, including cash flows, is a process embedded into the Groups internal financial reporting routines.
Forecasts are initially carried out at an individual operating unit level, but are consolidated and reviewed by Group management.
The availability of financing, headroom over existing facilities and forward compliance with financial covenants are monitored against expected cash flows.
The process takes into account the shorter-term liquidity needs of individual operating units or territories as well as the availability of funding to fulfil longer-term strategic objectives such as major capital expenditure or business acquisitions.

Credit risk Credit risk principally arises on short-term deposits, derivative financial instruments and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk arising on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is managed through the use of counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group only trades with recognised, creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to take on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The credit risk arising on trade receivables is spread across a large number of customers and across many countries.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group's maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
An analysis showing the ageing of trade receivables not impaired is given in note 17.

Capital management The primary objective of the Group's capital management of total equity and net debt is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares and vary the maturity profile of its borrowings.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Gearing ratio 2012 2011 Net debt m 97.7 101.8 Total equity m 329.0 301.5 Gearing ratio % 29.7 33.8 Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.

The Groups principal loan covenants are: EBITDA interest cover EBITDA being at least 3 times the net interest payable : and net debt to EBITDA ratio net debt being less than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
At 31 August 2012, the Group comfortably complied with its loan covenants.
EBITDA interest cover was 9.4 times 2011: 9.9 times whilst net debt to reported EBITDA was 0.7 times 2011: 0.9 times.
In addition, for compliance with loan covenants, reported EBITDA is adjusted for, inter alia, acquisitions and non-cash items, therefore, the measures improve when adjusted for these items.

Included within other loans is an amount of 1.3m representing the estimated financial obligation under a cooperative joint venture contract in Shanghai Fenner Conveyor Belting Co. Limited in China.
In the prior year, an amount of 0.8m in respect of this was included within noncontrolling interests in equity and this has been reclassified during the year.
In addition, the estimated value of the liability has been reassessed at 31 August 2012 and this resulted in an amount of 0.5 being charged within finance costs in the consolidated income statement.

Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-retirement schemes for qualifying employees in operations around the world.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The cost of the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The principal scheme is the Fenner Pension Scheme which is based in the UK.
The most recent triennial valuation of the Fenner Pension Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2011.
The actuarial valuations for all schemes were updated as at 31 August 2012 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities of the schemes are as follows: 2012 2011 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes Discount rate 4.0% 3.2% - 5.0% 5.5% 4.3% - 5.5% Inflation rate - RPI 2.5% 2.0% 3.1% 2.0% Inflation rate - CPI 2.0% 2.6% Rate of increase in salaries 3.5% 2.0% - 4.5% 4.1% 2.0% - 4.5% Rate of increase in benefits in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation increases: - capped at 5.0% based on RPI 2.5% 3.0% - capped at 2.5% based on RPI 1.8% 2.0% 2.1% - capped at 3.0% based on CPI 1.8% Expected rate of return on assets of the schemes: 6.3% 4.6% - 6.0% 7.4% 6.0% - 6.3% - Equity 2.3% 3.2% - 6.0% 3.4% 5.3% - 6.0% - Bonds 0.5% 0.5% - Cash The principal assumptions of the schemes are determined using appropriate expert advice and available market data.

Share-based payments The Group operates two equity-settled share-based payment schemes and one cash-settled scheme.
a Fenner PLC 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme Share options were granted to certain employees within the Group.
The exercise price of options granted is set at the market price of the shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is generally 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of the grant the options expire.
Options can only be exercised upon satisfaction of performance criteria.
This requires that the overall growth of the Groups earnings per share before amortisation of intangible assets acquired and exceptional items over a consecutive three year period exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9%.
The last grant of shares under the Executive Share Option Scheme was made in November 2004.
Details of movements in outstanding share options are as follows: Weighted average Options exercise price number pence At 1 September 2010, at 1 September 2011 and at 31 August 2012 20,406 123.5 At 31 August 2012, 20,406 2011: 20,406 options were exercisable.

Fenner PLC Annual Report 2012 91 Business Review Governance Remuneration Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Overview b Performance Share Plan Conditional awards of shares are made to certain employees within the Group.
The conditional award is made to each employee at the start of a three year performance period and is based on a percentage of the basic annual salary of each employee.
The awards are subject to the satisfaction of performance criteria.
For awards made between 2007 and 2009, the proportion of the conditional share awards that vest is based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR over the performance period compared to the TSR of the comparator group.
For awards made from 11 November 2010, the proportion of the conditional share awards that vest is based on a combination of the TSR measure and an earnings per share EPS measure.
The EPS measure accounts for 33% of the final allocation on vesting and the TSR measure for 67%.
The EPS performance target is set against underlying EPS growth in the Company measured over the three years from the end of the financial year preceding the year in which the award was made.
Details of movements in conditional awards under the Performance Share Plan are as follows: Shares number At 1 September 2010 2,281,618 Conditional awards during the year 385,080 Dividend roll up awards applied 306,661 Forfeited during the year 133,701 Final awards during the year 200,365 Lapsed during the year 280,974 At 1 September 2011 2,358,319 Conditional awards during the year 422,515 Dividend roll up awards applied 27,360 Final awards during the year 665,058 Lapsed during the year 882,938 At 31 August 2012 1,260,198 Dividend roll ups have been applied since 2008 in line with the PSP Rules.
They accrue over the Plan Cycle and are added to the original conditional award before the final award and allotment of shares is made.
The following conditional awards, including dividend roll up awards, were outstanding at 31 August 2012: Shares Date of conditional awards number 18 November 2009 426,445 17 November 2010 401,863 16 November 2011 431,890 1,260,198 The fair value of awards made under the Performance Share Plan is measured using the Monte Carlo simulation approach.
The following assumptions were used for each set of conditional awards: 18 November 17 November 16 November 2009 2010 2011 Share price at date of conditional awards 184.5p 287.3p 370.0p Fair value of shares awarded 144p 199p 254p Expected volatility 61% 63% 59% Expected life 3 year 3 y s e 3 y ars ears Risk free rate 1.7% 1.5% 0.3% Expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price for a three year period from the conditional award date.
