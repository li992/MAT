Corporate information Kentz Corporation Limited the Company is a limited liability company registered in Jersey registered number 58549 under the Companies Jersey law 1991 and is the parent company for the Kentz Group.
Kentz Corporation Limited is listed on the London Stock Exchange symbol:KENZ and is a member of the FTSE 250.
The Groups principal activity is the provision of engineering and construction services and technical support services, principally in the oil services sector.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kentz Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 22 March 2013.
2. significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
b Basis of preparation Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US$ rounded to the nearest thousand, which is the Companys functional currency and the Groups presentation currency.
Foreign operations are consolidated in accordance with the policies set out in note 2 e iii below.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments held for trading are recorded at their fairvalue.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions thataffect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from othersources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and in preparing an opening IFRS Statement of financial position at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
Going concern After making enquiries the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated nancialstatements.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
ii Acquisition accounting policy The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the acquisition method.
The results of acquired operations are included in the Consolidated income statement from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition by acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquirees identiable net assets.
com Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Kentz Corporation Limited 64 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. significant accounting policies continued Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date: any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit orloss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
Contingent consideration that is classied as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the fair value of non-controlling interest over the net identiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
Inter-company transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
profits and losses resulting from inter-company transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is re-measured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, withthe change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.
In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
Thismay mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassied to profit or loss.
iii Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that significant operating and financial decisions require the consent of more than one venturer.
The Group has two types of joint ventures: Jointly controlled entities: and Jointly controlled operations A jointly controlled entity is an entity over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The results, assets and liabilities of a jointly controlled entity are incorporated in these Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, the Groups share of the profit or loss of the joint venture after the date of acquisition is recognised in the income statement and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative post acquisition movements are adjusted against the cost of the investment.
A jointly controlled operation involves the use of assets and other resources of the Group and other ventures rather than the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity.
The Groups proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash ows of jointly controlled operations are incorporated into the Groups Financial Statements under the appropriate headings.
iv Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from the intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d New accounting standards and IFRIC interpretations The Groups assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is set out below: The following standards and interpretations, issued by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, are effective for the Group for the first time in the year ended 31 December 2012 and have been adopted by the Group: IFRS 7 Amendment, Financial instruments: Disclosures IAS 12 Amendment, Income Taxes IFRS 1 Amendment, First time adoption of IFRS Adoption of the standards and the interpretations above had no significant impact on the results or financial position of the Group during the year ended 31 December 2012.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been published.
The Group will apply the relevant standards from their effective dates and is currently assessing their impact on the Groups financial statements.
The Group estimates that the impact of the amended IAS 19 Employee Benets will be to increase finance costs in the Consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2012 www.

All other new standards, interpretations and amendments, which are effective for periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and which have not been adopted early, are expected to have an immaterial effect on the Groups future financial statements.
The standards are mandatory for future accounting periods but are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.

The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Groups presentation currency and the Companys functional currency.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to US$ at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the Statement of financial position date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical costs in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
iii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The results and cash ows of foreign operations are translated to US$ at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
iv Net investment in foreign operations Adjustments arising on translation of the results of foreign operations at average rate, and on re-statement of the opening net assets at closing rates, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as part of the overall gain or loss on disposal: the cumulative currency translation differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 the translation date to IFRS have been set to zero for ascertaining the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation subsequent to that date.
Translation differences arising after 1 January 2004 are presented as a separate component of equity in the foreign currency translation reserve in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
f Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy m. Certain items of property, plant and equipment which had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed costs, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
ii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment at the following rates: Buildings 10% Plant and xtures 10%33% Motor vehicles 20%33% The residual value, if not insignicant, is re-assessed annually.
com Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Kentz Corporation Limited 66 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. significant accounting policies continued g Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The Group leases certain property, plant and equipment.
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases commencement at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other long-term payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
h Goodwill and intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture, over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is presented separately in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Impairment losses previously recognised cannot be reversed see accounting policy m. ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses see accounting policy m. Intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives of three years.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as an expense as incurred.
i Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
If collectability appears unlikely compared with the original term of the receivable, the Group will determine the appropriate provision based on the available evidence at that time.
significant financial difficulty of the trade receivable, probability that the trade receivable will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments areconsidered indicators that the receivable is impaired.
j Financial assets All financial assets are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial assets classied as at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs.
Where the effect on fair value at initial recognition of any extended payment terms is not material, no adjustments were made.
Subsequent measurement for financial assets is set out below.
Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables excluding Value Added Taxation, prepayments and operating lease receivables, loans and cash and cash equivalents that have xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classied as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method less any impairment loss.
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term trade receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The accounting policy for bank and cash balances is dealt with under cash and cash equivalents set out below.
fide-recognition of financial assets The Group fide-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash ows from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
k Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial liabilities classied as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement for financial liabilities is set out below.
com OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 67 2. significant accounting policies continued Other financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective interest basis, except for short-term payables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liabilities or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
fide-recognition of financial liabilities The Group fide-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
On fide-recognition, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability, including related unamortised costs, and settlement amountpaid are included in profit or loss.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows.
Bank overdrafts are included in interest bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
m Impairment i Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than work in progress and deferred tax assets see accounting policy t ii, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount isestimated.
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units onapro rata basis.
ii Financial assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classied as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered an indicator that the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss is measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the income statement.
n Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
o Employee benets i Dened contribution plans Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement asincurred.
ii Dened benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of the dened benefit pension plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the Statement of financial position date on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualied actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The excess of scheme liabilities over scheme assets is included in the Statement of financial position under non-current liabilities.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the scheme expected to arise from employee service current service cost in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included as other finance income costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to the transition to IFRS are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
com Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Kentz Corporation Limited 68 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2. significant accounting policies continued When the benets of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benets become vested.
To the extent that the benets vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised and past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
A full actuarial valuation is carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation was performed on 1 May 2010. iii Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from employees as consideration for equity instruments of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the equity instruments is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted: t including any market performance conditions for example, an entitys share price : t excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions for example, profitability, sales growth targets and remaining an employee of the entity over a specified time period : and t including the impact of any non-vesting conditions.
Non-market performance and service conditions are included in assumptions about the number of equity instruments that are expected tovest.
The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to besatised.
At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of equity instruments that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
p Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest ratemethod.
q Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost.
Finance charges including any premiums payable on settlement are recognised in the Consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective rate of interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
r Revenue recognition and contract accounting i Construction and EPC contracts Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage of completion method.
When the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated cost of sales up to the year end bear to the estimated total costs of the contract.
When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the year-end which are considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount that it is probable will be accepted by the customer can be measured reliably.
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen.
On the balance sheet, the Group reports the net contract position for each contract as either an asset or a liability.
A contract represents an asset where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings, a contract represents a liability where the opposite is the case.
ii Technical support services Revenues from reimbursable contracts are recognised in the period in which the services are provided based on the agreed contract schedule of rates.
com OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 69 2. significant accounting policies continued s Net nancing costs Net nancing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the Income Statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted securities, is usually the ex-dividend date.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the Consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
t Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the Statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, differences relating to investment in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
u Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are classied as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the denition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Groups ordinary shares are classied as equity instruments.
v Treasury shares Consideration paid for the purchase of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve the treasury share reserve.
w Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identied as the Group Management Executive Committee.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Management makes estimates and judgements, including assumptions concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows.
Revenue recognition and contract accounting The Group uses the  method in accounting for its contract revenue.
Use of the  method requires management to estimate the stage of completion of a contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2 r. As a result, Kentz Group management is required to estimate the total cost to completion of all outstanding jobs at each period end.
Estimating costs to complete on such contracts requires the Group to make estimates of future costs to be incurred, based on work to be performed beyond the reporting date.
This estimate will impact revenues, cost of sales, work in progress, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and accrued contract expenses.
The Group provides for future losses on long-term contracts where it is considered probable that the contract costs are likely to exceed revenues in future years.
Estimating these future losses involves a number of assumptions about the achievement of contract performance targets and the likely levels of future cost escalation over time.
com Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Kentz Corporation Limited 70 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 3.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Pension benefits The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumptions used in determining the net cost income for pensions include the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
Additional information is disclosed in note 26.
Segmental reporting Management has determined the operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Group Management Executive Committee.
In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the Group has six operating segments, being six distinct regions as follows: Middle East Far East Africa Australasia Americas Europe including the Groups administrative function These segments align with the Groups internal financial reporting system and the way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker assesses performance and allocates the Groups resources.
The management team responsible for each segment is directly accountable for the performance of that segment to the Group Management Executive Committee which acts as the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group.
Each segment is reviewed in its totality by the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group Management Executive Committee assesses the trading performance of operating segments based on a measure of earnings before interest and tax operating profit.
Segment revenues and profit include Kentzs share of revenue and profit from equity accounted joint ventures.
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly income-earning assets and revenue, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.

Financial Risk Management The principal objective of the Groups treasury policy is to ensure that there are sufficient resources to finance the business.
The cash resources of the Group are retained in a combination of central and local bank accounts.
These accounts comprise current, call and short-term deposits with banks approved by the Board.
Financial instruments held by the Group principally comprise nancing facilities, cash and other items including receivables and payables, all of which arise directly from its operations.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews, agrees and monitors policies for managing each of these risks: these are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged during the period under review.
a Liquidity risk Group cash resources held at banks are monitored regularly by senior management locally and at Group level.
It is the Groups policy to retain sufficient funds in current and call accounts to meet short-term needs.
Surplus funds are retained on short-term interest-bearing deposits.

Financial Risk Management continued The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows.

The trade and other receivables are non-interest-bearing.
The cash and cash equivalents earn interest at oating rates based on individual bank market rates for the relevant currencies and durations.
The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to bank loans and amounts payable under asset nanceleases.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The impact on the Groups pre-tax profit due to a possible change in interest rates on loans and asset finance leases at the reporting date is demonstrated below: 2012 2011 US$000 US$000 1% movement 130 270 c Foreign currency risk The Financial Statements are prepared in US Dollars, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, borrowings and net investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the US Dollars.
The principal currencies giving rise to this risk are Australian Dollar, South African Rand, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Euro, Russian Rouble, Canadian Dollar, Trinidad Dollar, Botswana Pula, Mozambique Metical and Madagascar Ariary.
Exchange rate risk is managed at the subsidiary levels by ensuring that, as far as possible, income and expenses are denominated in the appropriate functional currency.
Certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk of trading and intercompany balances in line with Board-approved policy.
Those contracts outstanding at the relevant period ends are not designated as cash ow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures, which are short-term in nature with average duration of 11 months as at 31 December 2012.
The Group does not trade in any derivative financial instruments.
Exchange rate sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax to selected movements in subsidiary foreign exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The impact on profit before tax is based on a reasonably possible change in US Dollar exchange rates with respect to different oating exchange rate reporting currencies.
The impact on total equity is calculated by changing the exchange rates used in measuring the closing balance sheet values.
2012 2011 US$000 US$000 A 10% rate depreciation in these currencies versus US dollar Impact on profit before tax 3,239 832 Impact on total equity 1,239 2,132 d Credit Risk Credit risk is managed on a subsidiary basis in line with procedures established and approved by the Group board.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposure to customers including outstanding receivables and work in progress.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with investment grade credit ratings are accepted.
Exceptions to this policy are permitted subject to specic Board approval for relationship banks that do not have an independent credit rating or require collateral support to achieve an acceptable credit rating.
com OVERVIEW BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 23.
Financial Risk Management continued The Groups credit risk management policy in relation to trade receivables involves periodically assessing the financial reliability of customers taking into account their financial position past experience and other factors.
Credit risk is considered as part of the tender review process and the Group seeks to negotiate reasonable payment terms to mitigate such exposures.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum group credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
e Fair values Forward exchange contracts open at the reporting period ends are marked to market to fair value the contracts.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with notional contract values of US$76.9 million 2011: US$60.2 million and net unrealised gains of US$0.5 million US$1.5 million.
The estimated fair values of the remaining financial instruments of the Group approximate to their book values as at the relevant period ends.
The following criteria have been used to assess the fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
t Receivables, cash and cash equivalents and payables are based on their book values due to their short maturity period.
t Loans are based on their book values which represents the Directors opinion of their fair values.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amounts.
As the Groups nancing facilities bear interest at oating rates, which represent prevailing market rate, the Directors consider the carrying amount of these borrowings approximates their fair value.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the amounts due to from related companies approximates to the carrying value.
f Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders, to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital, and to have the exibility to take advantage of opportunities to develop the business.
Total capital is calculated based on equity as shown in the Statement of financial position, which amounted to US$280.164 million 2011: US$237.672 million.
So as to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares.
Deferred tax asset liabilities Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using tax rates applicable in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: Year ended 31 December In thousands of USD 2012 2011 Opening balance 841 256 Credit to the income statement 3,264 2,736 On acquisition of subsidiary note 32 552 Foreign exchange adjustment 2 7 Other 354 1,606 Net deferred tax asset at the end of the year 4,457 841 Deferred taxation is reected in the Statement of financial position as: Deferred tax asset 5,211 4,278 Deferred tax liability 754 3,437 Net asset 4,457 841 Deferred tax assets not provided Year ended 31 December In thousands of USD 2012 2011 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: Unutilised tax losses 13,877 14,931 Tax effect 1,768 1,866 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be generated in the subsidiaries where they arise against which the Group can utilise the benets.
No provision has been made for temporary differences applicable to investments in subsidiaries as the Group is in a position to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
