2 Presentation changes a Discontinued operations As described in note 3c, the Groups US life and annuity business and associated investment management operations together US Life, have been classified as held for sale.
As the Group will exit from a major geographical area of operations, previously presented as United States in the segmental reporting note, the results of US Life for the year, as well as those for preceding years, have been classified as discontinued operations.
The results presented as discontinued operations for 2011 and preceding years also include the results of Delta Lloyd N. V. as a subsidiary, which was deconsolidated during 2011. b Change to operating segments Following the announcement in April 2012 relating to the restructuring of the Group, the Groups operating segments were changed to align them with the revised organisational reporting structure.
The Group has determined its operating segments along market reporting lines, reflecting the management structure whereby a member of the Executive Management team is accountable to the group chief executive for the operating segment for which he is responsible.
Further details of the reportable segments are given in note 4. c Restatement of prior period figures Following a review of the classification of contracts issued by the Groups Italian long-term business certain portfolios have been reclassified from participating insurance contracts to participating investment contracts.
As a result there has been a reallocation from gross insurance liabilities at 31 December 2011 to gross liabilities for investment contracts of 2,722 million.
The change in insurance liabilities net of reinsurance recognised in the income statement for the year to 31 December 2011 has decreased by 168 million, and the change in investment contract provisions has increased by an equal amount.
There is no impact on profit for the year or equity reported for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 169 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 3 Subsidiaries continued i RAC Limited The loss in respect of RAC Limited in 2012 arises from residual costs related to the sale of that company in September 2011. ii Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania life business On 31 July 2012, the Group sold its operations in the Czech Republic and Hungary and its Romania life assurance business to MetLife, Inc, for 37 million.
Net assets disposed of were 32 million, comprising gross assets of 379 million and liabilities of 347 million, giving a profit on disposal of 3 million after transaction costs.
Recycling currency translation reserves of 4 million to the income statement resulted in an overall profit on disposal of 7 million.
The sale of our Romania pensions business is still subject to regulatory approval and is expected to complete in the next 12 months, so it has been classified as held for sale see note 3c v. iii Delta Lloyd associate On 5 July 2012, the Group sold 37.2 million shares in Delta Lloyd for 313 million net of transaction costs, reducing our holding at that date to 19.8% of Delta Lloyds ordinary share capital, representing 18.6% of shareholder voting rights.
As the Group no longer had significant influence over Delta Lloyd, the Group ceased to account for that company as an associate from 5 July 2012.
From that date, our holding was classified as a financial investment, held at fair value through profit and loss.
The loss on disposal is calculated as follows: 2012 m Cash consideration, net of transaction costs 313 Fair value of financial investment holding at 5 July 2012 315 Net Consideration 628 Interest in associate 595 Currency translation and investment valuation reserves recycled to income statement 162 Loss on disposal 129 On 8 January 2013 the Group announced the sale of its remaining shareholding in Delta Lloyd, resulting in gross cash proceeds of 353 million.
iv Sri Lanka On 4 December 2012, the Group sold its controlling 58.4% interest in Aviva NDB Holdings Lanka Private Limited Aviva NDB, to AIA Group Limited for consideration of 31 million.
Net assets of the business were 16 million comprising gross assets of 205 million and liabilities of 189 million.
After recycling of currency translation reserves of 3 million the profit on disposal amounted to 12 million.
c Assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale The assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2012 are as follows: 2012 2011 US Life1 Other Total Total m m m m Assets Goodwill 183 183 Acquired value of in-force and intangible assets 408 83 491 1 Interests in, and loans to, joint ventures and associates 126 126 12 Property and equipment 2 2 1 Investment Property 6 12 18 Loans 3,397 3,397 Financial investments 31,212 5,203 36,415 347 Reinsurance assets 644 239 883 1 Deferred acquisition costs 1,468 70 1,538 23 Other assets 769 97 866 15 Cash and cash equivalents 544 373 917 26 38,448 6,388 44,836 426 Additional impairment to write down the disposal group to fair value less costs to sell 2,233 2,233 Total assets 36,215 6,388 42,603 426 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 31,153 3,294 34,447 344 Gross liabilities for investment contracts 2,197 1,857 4,054 Unallocated divisible surplus 55 55 Provisions 184 3 187 4 Deferred tax liabilities 672 8 680 Borrowings 145 145 Other liabilities 1,497 346 1,843 15 Total liabilities 35,848 5,563 41,411 363 Net assets 367 825 1,192 63 1 US Life comprises US long term business previously reported under the heading United States and associated internal asset management operations previously reported under Aviva Investors in note 4 segmental information.
170 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 3 Subsidiaries continued The businesses classified as held for sale comprise: i US long term business On 8 November 2012 the Group confirmed it was in discussions with external parties with respect to its US life operations, consisting of Aviva Life and Annuity Company and the associated internal asset management operations of Aviva Investors North America, Inc US Life and these have been classified as held for sale.
On 21 December 2012 the Group announced that it had agreed to sell US Life to Athene Holding Ltd for consideration of 1.0 billion including the shareholder loan 1.1 billion including repayment of an external loan.
There is uncertainty in the ultimate consideration, which depends on the development of statutory surplus between the announcement of sale and ultimate completion date.
The transaction is expected to complete in 2013.
Following classification as held for sale, US Life has been re-measured to fair value less costs to sell resulting in an impairment loss of 2,359 million, recognised within Loss on the disposal and re-measurement of subsidiaries and associates in the income statement, as a component of the result of discontinued operations.
An impairment of 126 million has reduced the carrying value of property and equipment, investments in associates and prepayments within US Life to nil.
The remaining impairment of 2,233 million reduces the value of the US Life disposal group so that the carrying value of this business is equal to its fair value less costs to sell of 367 million.
As described in Note 2a, the results of US Life for the year, as well as those for preceding years, have been classified as discontinued operations in the income statement.
Other comprehensive income, net of tax from discontinued operations of 68 million includes 528 million fair value gains on available for sale financial investments, 235 million fair value gains on available for sale financial investments transferred to the income statement on disposal, 130 million foreign exchange losses, 12 million of impairment losses transferred to the income statement, and 107 million aggregate shareholder tax effect.
On completion of the disposal the currency translation reserves and investment valuation reserves relating to the US Life operations, currently recognised within equity, will be recycled to the income statement.
ii Irish long-term business Ark Life Irish long-term business is carried out through a subsidiary, Aviva Life Holdings Ireland Limited ALHI, which is 75% owned by Aviva and 25% owned by Allied Irish Bank AIB.
ALHI holds four subsidiaries, one of which is Ark Life Assurance Company Limited Ark Life which carries out bancassurance business via a distribution agreement with AIB.
The original distribution agreement was renewable in 2011 but, on 15 December 2011, AIB notified the Group that they did not wish to renew it and the existing shareholders agreement governing ALHI was terminated.
The termination of this agreement triggered the ability for both parties to exercise put and call options that will result in the unwind of the original structure such that the Ark Life business returns 100% to AIB and the Group will purchase the 25% minority stake in ALHI.
The formal exercise of these options was approved on 17 January 2012 and, as a result, the Ark Life business became held for sale on that date.
Completion of the transaction is subject to agreement of terms with AIB and regulatory approval.
Completion is expected in the next 12 months.
Managements current best estimate of the disposal proceeds for the Ark Life business is 232 million net of transaction costs, which is lower than its carrying value following impairments charged in 2011.
A further charge to profit of 111 million has been recognised during 2012 reflecting revised expected disposal proceeds.
The exercise of the put options in January 2012 over AIBs non-controlling interest in ALHI led to our reclassifying this noncontrolling interest from equity to financial liabilities as at 31 December 2011.
Our current estimate of the liability as at 31 December 2012 is 122 million.
A credit to the income statement of 76 million has been recognised in 2012 reflecting the revised expected purchase liability.
The net impact of these two movements is a charge to profit of 35 million, before exchange movements, recognised within net investment income.
Finalisation of the exit value for Ark Life and the purchase value for the minority share in ALHI is subject to the conclusion of discussions with AIB.
iii Spanish long-term business Aseval On 18 December 2012 Aviva reached a settlement with Bankia S. A. Bankia to transfer the Groups entire holding in Aseval Aseguradora Valenciana, Sociedad Annima fide Seguros y Reaseguros Aseval, a Spanish life assurance company, to Bankia.
Aseval was classified as held for sale at this date.
The transfer is expected to complete on or before 30 April 2013 with proceeds of 494 million.
Aseval is included within the Italy, Spain and Other operating segment at its carrying value.
iv Russian long-term business During the year the Group entered into negotiations to dispose of Aviva Russia.
On 27 February 2013 the Group announced the sale of the business to Blagosostoyanie for consideration of 35 million.
The transaction is expected to complete in the first half of 2013.
The business is included in the statement of financial position at its carrying value.
v Other Other businesses classified as held for sale comprise joint ventures in Taiwan and Malaysia, details of which are given in note 18 a, and the Groups pensions business subsidiary in Romania.

a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions, where not treated as exceptional.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: 2012 2011 Long-term business m m Investment variances and economic assumptions continuing operations 620 897 Investment variances and economic assumptions discontinued operations 342 719 Investment variances and economic assumptions 278 1,616 For continuing operations, negative investment variances of 620 million 2011: 897 million negative mainly relate to the UK.
The total for the UK includes increasing the allowance for credit defaults on UK commercial mortgages together with some adverse current year experience on this portfolio, and the cost of fide-risking activity.
Elsewhere, positive variances in Spain and France were offset by a negative variance in Italy.
In the prior period, the negative variance resulted from market falls and increased volatility in asset values in all major markets.
The positive variance of 342 million for discontinued operations relates to the US, driven by reductions in interest rates and credit spreads and the impact of favourable equity market performance on embedded derivatives.
The prior period negative variance 2011: 719 million negative also includes the result for Delta Lloyd up to the partial disposal on 6 May 2011 of 820 million.
Liabilities in Delta Lloyd are discounted using a yield curve based on a fully collateralised AAA bond portfolio.
Over the period up to the partial disposal, the AAA collateralised bond credit spread narrowed by about 80bps as a result of changes in the underlying bond index, which was the main driver of the negative variance.
c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholders and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the longterm business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other longterm business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2012 2011 2012 2011 % % % % United Kingdom 5.8 7.2 4.3 5.7 Eurozone 5.9 6.9 4.4 5.4 The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the 10-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as fair value, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held less an adjustment for credit risks.
Where such securities are classified as AFS, such as in the US, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.

This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: 2012 2011 Non-long-term business m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below continuing operations 7 266 Economic assumption changes continuing operations see g below 21 90 14 356 Short-term fluctuation in investment return discontinued operations 60 14 416 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation for continuing operations are as follows: 2012 2011 Non-long-term business Continuing operations m m Net investment income 827 602 Foreign exchange on unrealised gains losses and other charges 97 99 730 503 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 723 769 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 18 124 1 Other operations 11 142 7 266 730 503 1 Represents assets backing non-long-term business held by the France holding company.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return reflects assets backing non-long-term business held in the France holding company.
d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer-term return, are: Restated 2012 2011 m m Debt securities 9,297 9,371 Equity securities 774 551 Properties 139 152 Cash and cash equivalents 2,535 2,315 Other 5,997 6,476 Assets supporting general insurance and health business 18,742 18,865 1 Assets supporting other non-long-term business 206 268 Total assets supporting non-long-term business 18,948 19,133 Figures for 2011 have been restated to include loan balances supporting general insurance and health business, which contribute to the longer-term investment return 1 Represents assets in France holding company backing non-long-term business.

As explained in accounting policy K, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
The range of discount rates used is disclosed in note 39.

 LLP PwC replaced Ernst & Young LLP E&Y as the Groups principal auditor for the 2012 financial year.
The total remuneration payable by the Group, excluding VAT and any overseas equivalent thereof, to its principal auditors and their associates is shown below.
2012 Continuing operations m Fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for the statutory audit of the Aviva Group and Company financial statements 2.2 Fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for other services Audit of Group subsidiaries 9.6 Total audit fees 11.8 Audit related assurance 2.3 Other assurance services 7.2 Total audit and assurance fees 21.3 Tax compliance services 0.4 Tax advisory services 0.1 Services relating to corporate finance transactions 0.3 Other non-audit services not covered above 7.7 Fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for services to Group companies classified as continuing operations 29.8 Discontinued operations Fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for Audit of Group subsidiaries 1.7 Fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for other non-audit services to Group subsidiaries 0.3 Total fees payable to PwC LLP and its associates for services to Group companies 31.8 2011 Continuing operations m Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for the statutory audit of the Aviva Group and Company financial statements 2.5 Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for other services: Audit of Group subsidiaries 10.3 Additional fees related to the prior year audit of Group subsidiaries 0.9 Total audit fees 13.7 Audit related assurance 2.7 Other assurance services 5.6 Total audit and assurance fees 22.0 Tax compliance services 0.2 Other non audit services not covered above 2.0 Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for services to Group companies classified as continuing operations 24.2 Discontinued operations Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for audit of Group subsidiaries 3.6 Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for other assurance services to Group subsidiaries 0.5 Fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for other non-audit services to Group subsidiaries 0.2 Total fees payable to E&Y LLP and its associates for services to Group companies 28.5 The tables above reflect the disclosure requirements of SI2011 2198 The Companies Disclosure of Auditor Remuneration and Liability Limitation Agreements Amendment Regulations 2011.
Comparatives for 2011 have been adjusted accordingly.
In addition to the fees for 2012 shown above, during 2012 the Group paid PwC 0.2 million in relation to the audit of Group occupational pension schemes and paid E&Y 1.0 million in relation to the 2011 audit of group subsidiaries.
Fees payable for the audit of the Groups subsidiaries include fees for the statutory audit of the subsidiaries, both inside and outside the UK, and for the work performed by the principal auditors in respect of the subsidiaries for the purpose of the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Audit related assurance comprises services in relation to statutory and regulatory filings.
These include audit services for the audit of FSA returns in the UK and review of interim financial information under the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
Fees for other assurance services comprise non statutory assurance work which is customarily performed by the external auditor, including the audit of the Groups MCEV reporting.
Although embedded value is a primary management reporting basis and our disclosures require a full audit, the relevant fees are not classified as being for statutory audit.
As noted above PwC replaced E&Y as the groups principal auditor for the 2012 year.
Prior to 2012, PwC was a significant provider of consulting services to the Group.
The level of 2012 fees for non-audit services therefore includes fees billed in the year relating to projects that commenced prior to PwCs appointment as auditor.
All of these services are in compliance with applicable UK, US and IFAC independence rules.
We do not expect PwCs non-audit fees to continue at this level in the future.
Other assurance services in 2012 includes fees relating to the audit of the Groups MCEV reporting of 1.3 million, 1.8 million for examination of the Group Individual Capital Assessment and Economic Capital, and 3.4 million associated with assurance services to prepare the businesses for Solvency II implementation.
The 2012 fees for other non-audit services for continuing operations of 7.7 million includes advice to our European businesses in relation to the risk management aspects of Solvency II 1.9 million, 1.9 million relating to four regulatory advice engagements, 0.7 million relating to restructuring at Aviva Investors, 0.3 million for risk training, 0.3 million supporting an industry-wide competition review, 0.3 million for an additional claims reserves review and 2.3 million for other services.
The 2012 fees for tax compliance services of 0.4 million includes fees for one engagement in Higher Growth markets of 0.3 million, and fees for corporate finance transactions of 0.3 million relates to an engagement for an Aviva Investors property fund.
Details of the Groups process for safeguarding and supporting the independence and objectivity of the external auditors are given in the Audit Committee report.

As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profit and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Groups pre-tax profit loss attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax charge credit attributable to policyholders included in the total tax charge credit.
The difference between the policyholder tax charge credit and the impact of this item in the tax reconciliation can be explained as follows: 2012 2011 m m Tax attributable to policyholder returns 221 178 UK corporation tax at a rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% in respect of the policyholder tax deduction 54 47 Different local basis of tax of overseas profits 3 2 Different basis of tax policyholders per tax reconciliation 170 129 The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012.
A subsequent reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and will apply from 1 April 2013.
The substantively enacted rate of 23% has been used in the calculation of the UKs deferred tax assets and liabilities.
As announced in the 2012 Autumn Statement, the rate is expected to reduce further to 21% from 1 April 2014.
The aggregate impact of the reduction in rate from 23% to 21% would reduce the deferred tax assets and liabilities and increase IFRS net assets by approximately 31 million and will be recognised when the legislation is substantively enacted.
Finance Act 2012 included initial legislation introducing considerable changes to the regime for taxing UK life insurance companies applicable from 1 January 2013.
The impact of the legislation has been included in the results of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 but has not had a material impact.

The recoverable amount is the value in use of the cash generating unit unless otherwise stated.
Long-term business Value in use is calculated as an actuarially determined appraisal value, based on the embedded value of the business calculated in accordance with market consistent embedded value MCEV principles, together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If the embedded value of the business tested is sufficient to demonstrate goodwill recoverability on its own, then it is not necessary to estimate the present value of expected profits from future new business.
If required, the present value of expected profits arising from future new business written over a given period is calculated on an MCEV basis, using profit projections based on the most recent three year business plans approved by management.
These plans reflect managements best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant cash 192 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 16 Goodwill continued generating unit.
The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, mortality, morbidity and persistency.
Future new business profits for the remainder of the given period beyond the initial three years are extrapolated using a steady growth rate.
Growth rates and expected future profits are set with regards to management estimates, past experience and relevant available market statistics.
Expected profits from future new business are discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
See results of impairment testing for US long-term cash generating unit.
For other businesses classified as held for sale the recoverable amount was assessed based on the fair value less costs to sell of the business, based on the expected net disposal proceeds of the businesses.

The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three-year period.

The underlying assumptions of these projections include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates.

The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of the share of interest in the subsidiary to which it relates.
Results of impairment testing Following the impairment business review conducted during the year the US long-term cash generating unit was tested for impairment and the Directors concluded that the goodwill associated with this cash generating unit was no longer recoverable.
As a result, an impairment of 782 million was recognised during the period, reducing the carrying value of goodwill to nil.
Subsequently, the US business was classified as held for sale and recorded at its fair value less costs to sell see Note 3.
Management concluded that the goodwill associated with the Spanish long-term cash generating unit, excluding Aseval which is held for sale, is no longer fully recoverable.
An impairment of 76 million has been recognised reducing the carrying value of this cash generating unit to its recoverable amount as a result of a reduction to managements estimates for future profitability due to current economic circumstances.
Similarly, as a result of the test of the Italian long-term and general businesses, impairments of 27 million and 6 million respectively have been recognised.
Other than the CGUs noted above, the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating units including goodwill.

a Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise the value of the Union Financire fide France Banque distribution channel, where the existing lives of the assets and their competitive position in, and the stability of, their respective markets support this classification.
Impairment testing of these intangibles is covered in note 16 b. b Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.
Acquisitions of intangible assets with finite lives relate to Canadian broker businesses.
Disposals include the derecognition of exhausted assets which are fully amortised or impaired with nil carrying value.
Impairment losses on intangible assets with finite lives of 152 million arise from impairments of capitalised software in US long-term operations, UK long-term operations and UK general insurance operations of 102 million, 25 million and 22 million respectively, and 3 million in relation to other businesses.
Impairment tests were conducted as described in note 16 b.

i Disposal of Delta Lloyd On 5 July 2012, the Group sold 37.2 million shares in Delta Lloyd for 313 million net of costs, reducing the Groups holding to 19.8% of Delta Lloyds ordinary share capital, representing 18.6% of shareholder voting rights.
As the Group no longer has significant influence over Delta Lloyd, the Group ceased to account for that company as an associate from 5 July 2012.
Prior to sale, the Groups share of Delta Lloyds net asset value declined to a value below its quoted market value and therefore the impairment recognised in 2011 to reduce the carrying value of the associate to the quoted market value was redundant and no longer required.
The amount previously recognised as an impairment of 205 million has therefore been reversed during the current period, through the Groups share of loss after tax of associates, after exchange movements on the opening balance of 12 million.
ii Impairment testing Following the business review, management have determined that the goodwill in Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited is fully impaired.
An impairment of 147 million has been recognised in respect of this associate, reducing its goodwill to nil.

This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Valuations Standards Red book, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Similar considerations apply to properties under construction, where an estimate is made of valuation when complete, adjusted for anticipated costs to completion, profit and risk, reflecting market conditions at the valuation date.
The 106 million impairment loss charged to the income statement mainly relates to Aviva USAs property and equipment, the carrying value of which has been reduced to nil as set out in note 3c i.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 275 million 2011: 189 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

Outside the UK, valuations are produced by local qualified staff of the Group or external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, adjustments are made to reflect any material changes in fair value.
Values are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and are based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, lease expiry, or break option taking into consideration lease incentives and assuming no future growth in the estimated rental value of the property.
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties.
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2012 was 10,822 million 2011: 11,552 million.
Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 52 b i.
22 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, and provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy of financial instruments For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: Quoted market prices in active markets Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Examples are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets.
Modelled with significant observable market inputs Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar i. e. not identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks, current property values and default rates.
Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means marketcorroborated inputs.
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, and listed debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive.
Valuations, whether sourced from internal models or third parties include credit risk by adjusting the spread above the yield curve for government treasury securities for the appropriate amount of credit risk for each issuer, based on observed market transactions.
To the extent observed market spreads are either not used in valuing a security, or do not fully reflect liquidity risk, our valuation methodology, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, reflects a liquidity premium.
Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, we generally validate the price quoted by the broker by using internal models with observable inputs.
When the price obtained from the broker and internal model are similar, we look to the inputs used in our internal model to understand the observability of the inputs used by the broker.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, and the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Broker quotes are usually non-binding.

Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are certain private equity investments and private placements.
The majority of the Groups financial assets and certain financial liabilities are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage 5.5% of total financial assets recorded at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2. b Fair value hierarchy analysis An analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to fair value hierarchy is given below: Fair value hierarchy Less: Assets of operations Statement classified of financial Sub-total Amortised as held position Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 fair value cost for sale Total 2012 m m m m m m m Financial investments and loans notes 23 & 25 Loans 18,973 18,973 8,961 3,397 24,537 Fixed maturity securities  33,617 128,006 Equity securities 33,074 230 47333,777 1,248 32,529 Other investments including derivatives 21,704 5,510 2,87930,093 1,550 28,543 Total 162,731 68,301 13,434 244,466 8,961 39,812 213,615 Financial Liabilities Non-participating investment contracts 45,032 825 442 46,299 1,400 3,958 43,741 Borrowings note 48 1,332 1,332 7,007 145 8,194 Derivative liabilities note 49 132 1,570 59 1,761 108 1,653 Total 45,164 3,727 501 49,392 8,407 4,211 53,588 Discussion on the valuation techniques applied to value financial liabilities carried at fair value is included in the relevant footnote disclosure for the financial liability.

The transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 arose primarily in France 1.0 billion and the UK 0.3 billion as a result of changes in the level of activity and environment in the markets from which prices are sourced.
For the year to 31 December 2012, there were no transfers of financial liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels 2011: no transfers.

Included in this balance are 1,030 million net gains 2011: 354 million net losses attributable to assets still held at the end of the year.
The Group assesses the fair value hierarchy of its financial investments biannually at 30 June and 31 December.
Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are deemed to have occurred at the assessment date.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 for the year arose for the following reasons: Changes in the market observability of valuation inputs.
Changes in the market observability of inputs used to validate valuations.
Significant differences between third-party prices used for valuations and validation prices either sourced from third parties or internal models.
The transfers into and out of Level 3 in 2012 were predominantly in our business in France and related principally to changes in the market liquidity of certain debt securities resulting in changes to the availability of observable market inputs.
Of the 959 million net gains 2011: 387 million net losses recognised in the income statement during the year, a 968 million gain 2011: 390 million losses is recognised in net investment income and 9 million losses 2011: 3 million gains relates to impairments and is included in other expenses.
ii The principal investments classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: Structured bond-type products held by our business in France amounting to 8.6 billion 2011: 6.1 billion, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using third-party counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third-party models.
These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the third-party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2012, the values reported in respect of these products were the lower of counterparty and broker quotes and modelled valuations.
Notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to 1.0 billion 2011: 1.2 billion, for which there is no active market.
These are valued using counterparty quotes which are corroborated against index information obtained for similar asset classes, taking into further consideration the quality of the underlying loan portfolio, leverage structure, credit rating, illiquidity margins, market spreads and duration.
Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.3 billion 2011: 1.5 billion, of which 1.1 billion 2011: 0.9 billion is held by our UK business.
In valuing our interest in these funds, we rely on investment valuation reports received from the fund manager, making adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions between the date of the report and the balance sheet date and the fund managers carried interest.
In addition, an indexation adjustment is made to reflect changes in appropriate equity market indices between the valuation report date and balance sheet date.
External hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK, the US and France amounting to 1.3 billion 2011: 1.3 billion.
Valuations received from fund managers are based on net asset values.
However, insufficient information is provided on the underlying fund assets to support a classification other than Level 3.
Certain strategic interests in banking partners held by our Italian business amounting to 0.3 billion 2011: 0.3 billion.
Valuations are based on third-party independent appraisals, or where internally modelled, transactions in similar entities, discounted cash flow techniques and valuation multiples, using public and internal management information.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 0.9 billion 2011: 1.0 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 201 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 22 Fair value methodology continued iii Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
99% 2011: 99% of valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties and, where appropriate, validated against internally-modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally-modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing to a reasonable alternative the yield, NAV multiple, IRR or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 12.3 billion of the Groups Level 3 investments.
For these Level 3 investments, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value in the range of 558 million positive impact and 623 million adverse impact.
Of the 1.1 billion Level 3 investments for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, 0.8 billion relates to investments held in unitlinked and participating funds mainly in France where investment risk is predominantly borne by policyholders and therefore shareholder profit before tax is insensitive to reasonable changes in fair value of these investments.
The remaining 0.3 billion of Level 3 investments are held to back non-linked shareholder business and it is estimated that a 10% change in valuation of these investments would reduce shareholder profit before tax by 30 million.

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities note 49.
Of the above loans, 19,179 million 2011: 21,626 million are due to be recovered in more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
Loans at fair value Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 22.
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was 491 million loss 2011: 555 million loss.
The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2012 was 2,665 million loss 2011: 2,174 million loss.
Non-securitised mortgage loans include 4.1 billion 2011: 3.7 billion relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses which are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or other emergency services related premises.
For all such loans, government support is provided through either direct funding or reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan.
Although the loan principal is not , the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.

This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above.
In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title for the collateral received always occurs in such cases, although no market risk or benefit is taken.
In the event of a default, the Group is able to sell or repledge the collateral.
The amount of collateral received with respect to loans which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was 4,560 million 2011: 4,601 million.
No collateral was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default during the year 2011: nil.

This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of current arrangements In a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
AER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
In addition, Group companies have invested in loan notes issued by the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated statement of financial position.
In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

c Impairment of financial investments The movements in impairment provisions on available-for-sale financial investments for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 2012 were as follows: 2012 2011 Fixed Fixed maturity Equity Other maturity Equity Other securities securities Investments Total securities securities Investments Total m m m m m m m m At 1 January 126 5 7 138 151 825 7 983 Charge for the year taken to the income statement 12 2 14 19 2 21 Write back following sale or reimbursement 49 49 28 28 Write back following recovery in value 1 1 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 16 822 838 Foreign exchange rate movements 5 5 At 31 December 84 4 9 97 126 5 7 138 d Financial investment arrangements i Stock lending arrangements The Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas in accordance with established market conventions.
The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occur in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
Non-cash collateral received The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amount of financial assets received 206 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 25 Financial investments continued in this manner at 31 December 2012 was 16,043 million 2011: 20,053 million.
The value of collateral that was actually sold in the absence of default was nil 2011: 150 million.
Cash collateral received In addition to the above, the Group has received cash collateral under stock lending arrangements that has been recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation for its return.
The latter balance is included in note 49. ii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.
Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits.
At 31 December 2012 1,208 million 2011: 1,044 million of financial investments were restricted in this way.
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries.
Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.

No further credit risk provision is therefore required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
27 Deferred acquisition costs, other assets, prepayments and accrued income a Deferred acquisition costs and other assets carrying amount The carrying amount comprises: 2012 2011 m m Deferred acquisition costs in respect of: Insurance contracts Long-term business 2,122 2,733 Insurance contracts General insurance and health business 939 986 Participating investment contracts Long-term business 30 21 Non-participating investment contracts Long-term business 936 1,024 Retail fund management business 14 14 Total deferred acquisition costs 4,041 4,778 Surpluses in the staff pension schemes note 47 e vii 1,257 1,670 Other assets 56 19 Total 5,354 6,467 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 1,555 23 3,799 6,444 Deferrable acquisition costs DAC on long-term business are generally recoverable in more than one year whereas such costs on general insurance and health business are generally recoverable within one year.
Of the above total, 1,351 million 2011: 3,148 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date: the reduction in this amount reflects that the DAC balance for the US is included in amounts classified as held for sale at 31 December 2012.
For long-term business where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, the amount expected to be recovered is estimated and actual experience will differ.
Surpluses in the staff pension schemes are recoverable more than one year after the statement of financial position date.

Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 30 million 2011: 145 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 50 million 2011: 170 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.
The reduction in sensitivities for 2012 reflects that the US business is held for sale and carried at fair value less cost to sell.
The shadow adjustments relate to deferred acquisition costs on business in the US backed by investments classified as AFS.
As explained in accounting policy K, unrealised gains and losses on the AFS investments and the shadow adjustments above are both recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
c Other assets Other assets include 3 million 2011: 6 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
d Prepayments and accrued income Prepayments and accrued income of 3,104 million including assets classified as held for sale 2011: 3,235 million, includes 108 million 2011: 90 million that is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
28 Assets held to cover linked liabilities Certain unit-linked products have been classified as investment contracts, while some are included within the definition of an insurance contract.
The assets backing these unit-linked liabilities are included within the relevant balances in the consolidated statement of financial position, while the liabilities are included within insurance and investment contract provisions.
This note analyses the carrying values of assets backing these liabilities.

i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2012 2011 Share price 326p 312p Exercise price 266p 268p Expected volatility 41% 58% Expected life 3.71 years 3.64 years Expected dividend yield 7.98% 6.40% Risk-free interest rate 0.37% 0.89% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
2,862,952 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2011: 182,907. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2012 2011 Share price 331.54p 435.70p 1 Expected volatility 37% 66% 1 Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 38% 65% 1 Correlation between Aviva and competitors share price 63% 57% Expected life 3.00 years 3.00 years 2 Expected dividend yield n a n a 1 Risk-free interest rate 0.42% 1.79% 1 For awards with market-based performance conditions.
2 The long term incentive plan awards granted in 2011 and 2012 include additional shares being provided to employees equal to dividend rights before vesting.
As a result, no dividend yield assumption is required for these awards.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the share award prior to its date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the share awards.

The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2012 was: 2012 2011 m m Issued and paid up 100,000,000 8.375% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 100,000,000 8.75% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 200 200 Under its articles of association, the Company may issue and allot Sterling New Preference Shares and Euro New Preference Shares, which, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.

34 Merger reserve This note describes the use of the merger reserve.
Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
The balance on the reserve of 3,271 million 2011: 3,271 million has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc RAC in 2005.
Because RAC ownership was immediately transferred from Aviva plc to a subsidiary company, this reserve is unaffected by the disposal of RAC in 2011.

b Long-term business liabilities i Business description The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: In the UK mainly in: New With-Profits sub-fund NWPSF of Aviva Life & Pensions UK UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA will be used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the US, there are two main types of business protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
In other operations in Europe and Asia, a range of long-term insurance and savings products are written.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 219 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 39 Insurance liabilities continued ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.
In 2010, a test case was taken to the European Court of Justice to rule on the current law and practice whereby insurers may take into account a persons gender in the assessment of risk and consequently the pricing of insurance products.
The ruling was issued on 1 March 2011 and required gender equality for pricing from 21 December 2012.
The impact of the ruling on existing long-term business provisions in our UK and European businesses is not considered to be material.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
For UK with-profit life funds falling within the scope of the FSA realistic capital regime, and hence FRS 27, an amount may be recognised for the present value of future profits PVFP on non-participating business written in a with-profit fund where the determination of the realistic value of liabilities in that with-profit fund takes account, directly or indirectly, of this value.
For our UK with-profit funds, no adjustment for this value is made to the participating insurance and investment contract liabilities or the unallocated divisible surplus.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policyrelated liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profits sub-funds in UKLAP, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: 220 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 39 Insurance liabilities continued Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK swaps was used.
This replaced the use of a spot yield on UK government securities plus a margin of 0.1%, which was used at 31 December 2011.
The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2012 of 1.92% 2011: 2.20% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
Volatility 2012 2011 Equity returns 26.3% 26.4% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 17.1% 18.0% The equity volatility used depends on term, money-ness and region.
The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.
Fixed interest yield volatility is also dependent on term and money-ness.
The figure shown is for a ten-year swap option with ten-year team, currently at the money.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2012 have been set consistently with the year-end 2011 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions for with-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2012 2011 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business The valuation of non-profit business is based on regulatory requirements, adjusted to remove certain regulatory reserves and margins in assumptions, notably for annuity business.
Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 221 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 39 Insurance liabilities continued The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2012 2011 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 1.8% 1.8% to 1.9% Pensions conventional non-profit 2.2% 2.6% Annuities Conventional immediate and deferred annuities 2.6% to 4.1% 2.2% to 4.3% Non-unit reserves on Unit Linked business Life 2.1% 1.8% to 2.2% Pensions 2.5% 2.2% to 2.7% Income Protection Active lives 2.2% 2.4% Claims in payment level 3.1% 3.6% Claims in payment index linked 0.7 % 1.0 % The above valuation discount rates are after reduction for investment expenses and credit risk.
For conventional immediate annuity business the allowance for credit risk comprises long-term assumptions for default and downgrades, which vary by the credit ratings for bonds and mortgages, and short-term supplementary allowances for higher expected defaults during the current economic conditions.
The credit risk allowance made for corporate bonds and commercial mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited equated to 56 bps and 89 bps respectively at 31 December 2012 2011: 60 bps and 69 bps respectively.
For corporate bonds, the allowance represented 30% of the average credit spread for the portfolio 2011: 26%.
The total valuation allowance held by Aviva Annuity UK Limited in respect of corporate bonds and mortgages, including healthcare mortgages, was 1.8 billion 2011: 1.6 billion over the remaining term of the UK Life corporate bond and commercial mortgage portfolio.
Total liabilities for annuity business were 30 billion at 31 December 2012 2011: 27 billion.
Mortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality tables used 2012 2011 Assurances Non-profit AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 AM00 AF00 or TM00 TF00 adjusted adjusted for smoker status and for smoker status and age sex age sex specific factors specific factors Pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting AM00 AF00 adjusted AM00 AF00 adjusted Annuities in payment Pensions business PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement General annuity business IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement For pensions annuity business in 2012, the underlying mortality assumptions for Males are 100.5% of PCMA00 with base year 2000, improvements based on CMI 2011 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% and an addition of 0.5% to all future annual improvements: for Females the underlying mortality assumptions are 95.5% of PCFA00 with base year 2000, improvements based on CMI 2011 with a long-term improvement rate of 1.0% and an addition of 0.5% to all future annual improvements.
Year-specific adjustments are made to allow for selection effects due to the development of the Enhanced Annuity market.
b France The majority of reserves arise from single premium savings products and are based on the accumulated fund values, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
For traditional business the net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2012 and 2011 2012 and 2011 TD73-77, TD88-90, Life assurances 0% to 4.5% TH00-02, TF00-02 Annuities 0% to 4.5% TGF05 TGH05 222 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 39 Insurance liabilities continued c United States For the major part of our US business, insurance liabilities are measured in accordance with US GAAP as at the date of acquisition.
The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2012 was 4.50% 2011: 4.50%.
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
For the indexed products, the liability held is calculated based on the option budget method and is equal to the host contract and the calculated value of the derivative.
The value of the derivative is based on the present value of the difference between the projected fund value and the underlying fund guarantee.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, the largest component of the US business, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 1.00% to 5.20% in 2012 2011: 1.00% to 5.20%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Deferred income reserves of 85 million in respect of insurance contracts in the United States are included under Other liabilities Deferred income in note 50.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
d Other countries In all other countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 1 Restated 2012 2011 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 131,171 157,988 Provisions in respect of new business 8,631 10,894 Expected change in existing business provisions 8,362 8,541 Variance between actual and expected experience 943 2,279 Impact of other operating assumption changes 718 61 Impact of economic assumption changes 1,726 5,663 Other movements 109 623 Change in liability recognised as an expense 2,111 5,053 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 214 6 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 32,159 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,878 295 Carrying amount at 31 December 131,190 131,171 1 Following a review of the classification of contracts issued by the Groups Italian long-term business, there has been a reallocation from participating insurance liabilities at 31 December 2011 to participating investment contract liabilities of 2,722 million.
The variance between actual and expected experience of 0.9 billion in 2012 was primarily due to the impact of favourable investment returns on liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The 1.7 billion impact of economic assumption changes reflects reductions in valuation interest rates, primarily in respect of immediate annuity and participating insurance contracts in the UK.
The 0.7 billion impact of operating assumption changes mainly relates to mortality assumption in the UK, with the net impact reduced by movements in corresponding reinsurance assets.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.

The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
The Group only establishes loss reserves for losses that have already occurred.
The Group therefore does not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, the Group takes into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.
As at 31 December 2012 As at 31 December 2011 Outstanding Outstanding claim IBNR Total claim claim IBNR Total claim provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions provisions m m m m m m Motor 3,737 1,051 4,788 3,960 995 4,955 Property 1,408 212 1,620 1,392 155 1,547 Liability 2,003 1,394 3,397 2,206 1,321 3,527 Creditor 54 13 67 59 19 78 Other 509 173 682 482 156 638 7,711 2,843 10,554 8,099 2,646 10,745 ii Discounting Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Class 2012 2011 2012 2011 Reinsured London Market business 2.0% 2.20% 11 years 13 years Latent claims 0.33% to 3.35% 0.75% to 3.25% 6 to 15 years 7 to 16 years Structured settlements 2.60% 2.70% 33 years 31 years The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 11,004 million 2011: 11,420 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 6 and 15 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
During 2012, the Group has seen a levelling off in the number of new bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements, which are reserved for on a discounted basis.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case setting procedures.
Claim technicians apply their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
They take into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for authorisation.
No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claims may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
224 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 39 Insurance liabilities continued The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
As noted in section in section b ii Group Practice, an area of judgement is the impact of a European Court of Justice ruling in March 2011 on gender equality for the pricing of insurance products.
At 31 December 2012, the impact of the ruling on existing general business provisions was not considered to be material.
The following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims and legal fees.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate 240 million greater than the best estimate, or 65 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2012, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 95 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56.
Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables.
The Ogden Tables contain a discount rate that is set by the Lord Chancellor and that is applied when calculating the present value of loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
The process for setting this discount rate is currently under review.
The timing of the conclusion of this review is unclear and it is still uncertain whether or by how much the rate will change.
However an allowance has been included in provisions for a reduction in the Ogden discount rates.
A reduction in the Ogden discount rates will increase lump sum payments to UK bodily injury claimants.

The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2003, by the end of 2012 5,727 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,385 million was reestimated to be 5,791 million at 31 December 2012.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2012 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the movement in prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2012 were: 47 million release from UK & Ireland, including Group reinsurance business, due to favourable development in Group reinsurance, health and across a number of lines of business in Ireland.
51 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal motor and commercial property claims in France.
122 million release from Canada mainly due to continued favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2011 were: 42 million strengthening from UK & Ireland, including Group reinsurance business, mainly due to unfavourable development on commercial motor, commercial liability and December 2010 freeze claims in the UK offset by favourable development of personal and commercial motor claims in Ireland.
6 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal and commercial motor claims in France offset by adverse development in Italy and Delta Lloyd.
92 million release from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario, and commercial liability.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2003.
The undiscounted claim provisions for continuing operations, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2012 were 1,003 million 2011: 929 million.
The movement in the year reflects strengthening of provisions by 8 million in the UK 2011: exceptional strengthening of 35 million, other increases in undiscounted provisions of 51 million 2011: 23 million, reclassification of commercial liability provisions of 55 million, claim payments, reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange rate movements.
e Provision for unearned premiums Movements The following changes have occurred in the provision for unearned premiums UPR during the year: 2012 2011 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 4,483 4,855 Premiums written during the year 9,535 10,364 Less: Premiums earned during the year 9,514 10,099 Change in UPR recognised as income 21 265 Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 6 161 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 424 Foreign exchange rate movements 57 52 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,441 4,483 228 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 40 Liability for investment contracts This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how the Group calculates these liabilities and the assumptions used.
a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 1 Restated 2012 2011 Long-term business m m Participating contracts 66,849 67,707 Non-participating contracts at fair value 46,299 43,990 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 1,400 1,669 47,699 45,659 Total 114,548 113,366 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 4,054 110,494 113,366 1 Following a review of the classification of contracts issued by the Groups Italian long-term business, there has been a reallocation from participating insurance liabilities at 31 December 2011 to participating investment contract liabilities of 2,722 million.
b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 39.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated divisible surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 41.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 45,087 million in 2012 are unit linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves, if required, on a fair value basis.
These contracts are generally classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 27 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 50.
In the US, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may, subject to a call premium, be terminated by Aviva at any time.
Aviva issued no new funding agreements in 2012.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements as at 31 December 2012 were 4.688% and 0.305% respectively.
Funding agreements issued before 2008 are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows and, for business issued since 2008, are measured at amortised cost.
Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk.
Funding agreements carried at fair value total 0.6 billion and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.
c Movements in the year The following movements have occurred in the year: i Participating investment contracts 1 Restated 2012 2011 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 67,707 72,440 Provisions in respect of new business 2,695 3,688 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,039 2,618 Variance between actual and expected experience 102 2,708 Impact of operating assumption changes 9 72 Impact of economic assumption changes 74 631 Other movements 82 211 Change in liability recognised as an expense 759 868 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,610 1,352 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 2,523 Other movements 7 10 Carrying amount at 31 December 66,849 67,707 1 Following a review of the classification of contracts issued by the Groups Italian long-term business, there has been a reallocation from participating insurance liabilities at 31 December 2011 to participating investment contract liabilities of 2,722 million.

The rise in investment markets increased the value of unit linked contracts, which comprise the vast majority of the non-participating investment contract liabilities.
For unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non-participating investment contract liabilities.
The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
41 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options that the Group has given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 39 and 40. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
230 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 41 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were 1,156 million at 31 December 2012 2011: 1,170 million.
With the exception of the New With-Profits Sub Fund NWPSF, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were 180 million at 31 December 2012 2011: 193 million.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to certain conditions.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 35 million at 31 December 2012 2011: 35 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2012.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 33 billion at 31 December 2012 2011: 33 billion.
The guaranteed minimum bonus is agreed between Aviva France and the AFER association at the end of each year, in respect of the following year.
The bonus was 3.45% for 2012 2011: 3.43% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 3.94% 2011: 3.92%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 14 billion at 31 December 2012 2011: 14 billion and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2012 for this guarantee is 101 million 2011: 130 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2012, total sums at risk for these contracts were 223 million 2011: 631 million out of total unit-linked funds of 12 billion 2011: 12 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 88 million 2011: 96 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 21 million 2011: 26 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2012 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 256 million 2011: 271 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 231 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 41 Financial guarantees and options continued No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 0.4 million 2011: 5.5 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
Return of premium guarantee Until 2005, Aviva Life and Pensions Ireland wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, after five or six years.
The first tranche expired before the end of the previous financial reporting period.
The second tranche expired during the last quarter of the current reporting period.
As a result there is no provision held for this business 2011: 7 million.
iii Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2012, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 3 billion 2011: 3 billion with a further reserve of 0.1 million 2011: 5.1 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 10 billion 2011: 11 billion, with a further provision of 45 million 2011: 43 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 5 million 2011: 18 million in Spain and 1 million 2011: 5 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2012 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.89% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
iv United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 1.06% 2011: 2.48% for indexed life and 1.57% 2011: 2.51% for indexed deferred annuities is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the embedded options.
The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default.
The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2012 is an increase of 269 million 2011: 453 million, and is principally attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk.
At 31 December 2012, the total liabilities for indexed products were 23 billion 2011: 22 billion, including liabilities for the embedded option of 2.7 billion 2011: 2.6 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 151 million 2011: 152 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 167 million 2011: 167 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2012, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 0.8 billion 2011: 0.9 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2012, a total of 11.0 billion 2011: 10.1 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit, taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
232 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 42 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 2012 2011 m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 4,291 3,747 Participating investment contracts 3 1 Non-participating investment contracts 1,678 1,626 5,972 5,373 Outstanding claims provisions 93 126 6,065 5,499 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 900 974 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 354 395 1,254 1,369 Provisions for unearned premiums 248 245 1,502 1,614 7,567 7,113 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 883 1 Total 6,684 7,112 1 Balances in respect of all reinsurance treaties are included under reinsurance assets, regardless of whether they transfer significant insurance risk.
Of the above total, 5,251 million 2011: 5,086 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
b Assumptions The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability.
c Movements The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: i In respect of long-term business provisions 2012 2011 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,373 5,115 Asset in respect of new business 387 187 Expected change in existing business asset 166 7 Variance between actual and expected experience 197 290 Impact of operating assumption changes 306 9 Impact of economic assumption changes 143 433 Other movements 137 260 Change in asset 450 648 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 197 2 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 375 Foreign exchange rate movements 48 13 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,972 5,373 The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The changes to the reinsurance asset from assumption changes mainly relates to business in the UK and Ireland, with corresponding movements in gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.

This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This note only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as unallocated divisible surplus, reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.

This had the effect of increasing liabilities and hence a negative impact on profit.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
The impact of tax and other assumptions relates mainly to strengthening of credit default assumptions for commercial mortgages backing UK annuity business.
234 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 44 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain at the reporting date.
Therefore the expected duration for settlement of the UDS is not defined.
The following movements have occurred in the year: 2012 2011 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 650 3,428 Change in participating contract assets 6,140 3,016 Change in participating contract liabilities 253 244 Other movements 77 70 Change in liability recognised as an expense 6,316 2,702 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposal 1 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 144 Foreign exchange rate movements 24 60 Other movements 5 8 Carrying amount at 31 December 6,986 650 Less: Amounts classified as held for sale 55 6,931 650 In Italy, the UDS balance was 2 million negative at 31 December 2012 2011: 1,449 million negative.
In Spain, certain participating funds had negative UDS balances at 31 December 2012, although in aggregate the UDS balance was 95 million positive 2011: 13 million positive.
Negative UDS balances result from an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
The negative balances were tested for recoverability using embedded value methodology and in line with local accounting practice.
Testing is conducted at a participating fund-level within each life entity.
The negative balances are considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
In Italy, there was a loss of 9 million for negative UDS considered irrecoverable 2011: 17 million loss, and in Spain a reversal of 33 million of previous losses 2011: 49 million loss.
In Italy the estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance uses a real-world embedded value method, with a risk-discount rate of 6.25%.
The embedded value method includes implicit allowance for the time value of options and guarantees.
If the risk discount rate were increased by 1% it is estimated that the recoverable negative UDS balance would be unchanged.
In Spain, the estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance uses a market-consistent embedded value method.

In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 1,005 million 2011: 910 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 278 million will expire within the next 20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 652 million 2011: 418 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2012 2011: nil.

The material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Canada and Ireland with the main UK scheme being the largest.
This note gives full IAS 19 disclosures for these schemes.
The smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 46.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section e iv below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
b Membership The number of scheme members was as follows: United Kingdom Ireland Canada 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Number Number Number Number Number Number Active members 791 1,063 Deferred members 56,825 57,328 1,246 998 1,022 1,213 Pensioners 30,647 30,447 723 707 1,344 1,284 Total members 87,472 87,775 2,760 2,768 2,366 2,497 As noted below, the final salary sections of both the UK schemes were closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2011.
The Canadian scheme closed to future accrual on 31 December 2011. c UK schemes In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011.
The Group confirmed its decision to close the final salary sections of both UK schemes with effect from 1 April 2011, with entry into the defined contribution sections being offered to the staff members affected.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS.
Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with adding future accrual for active members, and has also led to lower service costs and their cash funding since April 2011. i Defined benefit section of the ASPS This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to as the trustees.
The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed and funding levels are then monitored on an annual basis.
At 31 March 2009, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, which uses more prudent assumptions than are required for reporting under IAS 19, of 3.0 billion.
As a result of that valuation, the Company and the trustees have agreed a long-term funding plan where contributions, together with anticipated growth in scheme investments, are expected to eliminate the funding deficit over time.
Under this agreement, deficit funding payments of 378 million were made in 2010, 178 million in 2011 and 128 million in 2012.
Further funding payments of 144 million are expected in 2013.
Funding payments along with the rise in gilt yields and return on invested scheme assets have resulted in a reduced deficit which is estimated to have fallen by 1.3 billion to 1.0 billion at 31 December 2012.
The Company is currently undergoing a triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2012, which is expected to be finalised by 30 June 2013. ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Company contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2013.
238 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 47 Pension obligations continued d Charge to staff costs in the income statement The total pension charge to staff costs of all the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2012 2011 m m Continuing operations UK defined benefit schemes 12 36 Overseas defined benefit schemes 7 22 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b 19 58 UK defined contribution schemes 91 75 Overseas defined contribution schemes 11 11 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 102 86 Total charge from continuing operations 121 144 Total charge from discontinued operations 5 16 Total charge for pension schemes 126 160 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2012 or 2011. e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada, are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2013, including the ASPS deficit funding, are currently expected to be 230 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out providers.
This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased to cover a part or all of the liability.
A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher estimate of the pension deficit than under an on-going approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction.
However there is no active market of organisations that would be able to offer a full buy-out option for schemes of the size of our main UK scheme.
There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present.
The Canadian defined benefit plans liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation.
There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the plans liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche.
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2012.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2012.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 239 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 47 Pension obligations continued The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Ireland Canada 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Inflation rate 3.0% 3.1% 2.0% 2.0% 2.5% 2.5% General salary increases 4.8% 4.9% 3.5% 3.5% 3.0% 3.75% Pension increases 3.0% 3.1% 2.0% 2.0% 1.25% 1.25% Deferred pension increases 3.0% 3.1% 2.0% 2.0% Discount rate 4.5% 4.9% 3.5% 5.7% 3.75% 4.5% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 2.0 billion and the service cost for the year by 2 million.
It would also increase the interest cost on the liabilities by 1 million.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2012 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK ASPS Club Vita pooled experience, including an allowance for future improvements 60 90.1 93.3 90.1 92.2 30.1 33.3 30.1 32.2 RAC SAPS series 1, including allowances for future improvement 65 87.9 90.9 89.9 91.9 22.9 25.9 24.9 26.9 Ireland 94% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 87.0 90.2 89.9 93.0 26.0 29.2 28.9 32.0 Canada UP1994, with Projection Scale AA applied on a generational basis 65 84.7 86.2 87.1 87.9 19.7 21.2 22.1 22.9 The assumptions above are based on commonly used mortality tables and, in the UK, are those used by both schemes trustees in the most recently completed full actuarial valuations.
The tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions long and medium cohort projection tables for the ASPS and RAC schemes respectively and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% pa for males and 1.0% pa for females.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the liabilities in all the schemes by 293 million and would not significantly impact the service cost for the year.
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 20 years in the main UK scheme, 21 years in the RAC scheme, 22 years in the Irish scheme and 13 years in the Canadian scheme.
The undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme are expected to be as shown in the chart below: 240 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 47 Pension obligations continued Undiscounted benefit payments m Deferred member cash ows Pensioner cash ows 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2013 2043 2073 2103 ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Ireland Canada 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Equities 5.8% 7.2% 5.9% 6.9% 5.8% 7.0% Bonds 3.4% 4.4% 3.2% 2.7% 3.2% 3.2% Property 4.3% 5.7% 4.4% 5.4% n a n a Cash 0.7% 0.6% 0.9% 2.7% 0.8% 1.0% The expected rates of return on the schemes assets presented above are as at the beginning of the year.
The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns for equities and properties are aligned with the rates used for the Groups longer-term investment return assumptions.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses and, in Ireland, the government levy on pension fund assets.
The amended IAS 19, Employee Benefits, which is effective from 1 January 2013, will replace the concept of expected return on scheme assets with interest on scheme assets, which will be calculated using the same interest rate as applied for the purpose of discounting the defined benefit obligation.
iii Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies Plan assets include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated statement of financial position of 62 million 2011: 112 million and insurance policies with other Group companies of 179 million 2011: 163 million in the main UK scheme.

vi Risk management and asset allocation strategy As noted above, the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of debt securities, equity securities and property.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal risks to which the scheme is exposed are interest rate, inflation and equity markets.
These are actively mitigated for example, by using inflation and interest rate swaps.
Additionally, the exposure to equities has been reduced over time.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.

The fall in the pension schemes net surplus during 2012 is mainly attributable to losses arising from changes in actuarial assumptions, which primarily reflect the impact of lower discount rates for liabilities.

Subordinated debt is stated net of notes held by Group companies which were nil 2011: 32 million.
All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost.
As described in note 57, the Group has designated a portion of its euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European and American subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt, included in the table above, at 31 December 2012 was 1,741 million 2011: 1,815 million.
Where subordinated debt is undated or loan notes are perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years.
Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 72 million 2011: 73 million.
244 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 48 Borrowings continued Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.
Year-end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies.

These loan notes are carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a market-determined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.

The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2012 was 4,435 million 2011: 3,814 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2012 was 246 million 2011: 246 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
iii Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 603 million issued by the Company 2011: 506 million and is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 39 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising there from, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 247 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 51 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Note 41 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
The FSA regulates the Groups UK business from 1 April 2013, the FSA will split into two new regulatory bodies: the Prudential Regulation Authority PRA, which will be a subsidiary of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority FCA and will monitor the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole.
The FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation: to investigate marketing and sales practices: and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers, but in some cases they also operate a system of prior product approval.
The Groups regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and take corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the day-to-day management of the business.
e Payment protection insurance PPI mis-selling In September 2009, the FSA launched an investigation into sales practices for payment protection insurance PPI.
On 10 August 2010, the FSA announced that mis-selling of PPI policies had been widespread and that consumers who could prove mis-selling would be entitled to financial redress from distributors of the policies.
The directors do not consider that the Group is liable for mis-selling in its role as underwriter and so no provision is currently necessary.
f Structured settlements The Company has purchased annuities from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants.
As a result of these arrangements, the Company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk for these types of arrangements is approximately $1,145 million as at 31 December 2012 2011: $1,085 million, 2010: $1,063 million.
Credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability.
This risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the life insurance industry compensation plan.
As at 31 December 2012, no information has come to the Companys attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in life insurers from which it has purchased annuities and consequently no provision for credit risk is required.
g Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
At 31 December 2012, the Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
At 31 December 2012, the Group and Company had no exposure 2011: nil and 334 million respectively.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
There are a number of charges registered over the assets of Group companies in favour of other Group companies or third parties.
In addition, certain of the Companys assets are charged in favour of certain or its subsidiaries as security for intra Group loans.
The Groups insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate.
Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.
52 Commitments This note gives details of our commitments to capital expenditure and under operating leases.
a Capital commitments Contractual commitments for acquisitions or capital expenditures of investment property and property and equipment, which have not been recognised in the financial statements, are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Investment property 6 23 Property and equipment 36 36 42 59 248 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 52 Commitments continued Contractual obligations for future repairs and maintenance on investment properties are nil 2011: nil.
The Group has capital commitments to its joint ventures of 157 million 2011: 258 million and to other investment vehicles of nil 2011: nil.

This note shows where this capital is employed.
Accounting basis and capital employed by segment 3 The table below shows how our capital, on an MCEV basis, is deployed by segment and how that capital is funded.
2012 2011 m m Long-term savings 16,337 14,148 General insurance and health 6,089 5,875 Fund management 225 184 Other business 1,059 1,102 1 Corporate 588 508 Delta Lloyd 776 United States 365 361 Total capital employed 21,369 20,750 Financed by Equity shareholders' funds 12,434 12,829 Non-controlling interests 2,214 1,476 Direct capital instruments and fixed rate tier 1 notes 1,382 990 Preference shares 200 200 Subordinated debt 4,337 4,550 External debt 802 705 Total capital employed 21,369 20,750 1 Corporate includes centrally held tangible net assets, the staff pension scheme surplus and also reflects internal lending arrangements.
These internal lending arrangements, which net out on consolidation, arise in relation to the following: Aviva Insurance Limited AI acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance operations, giving rise to notional lending between the general insurance and holding company activities.
These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets of the general insurance business to be made available for use across the Group.
2 Subsequent to the year end, the Group has taken action to improve its access to dividends from the Groups insurance and asset management business by undertaking a corporate restructure.
This will see the Groups interest in the majority of its overseas businesses move to Aviva Group Holdings Limited from Aviva Insurance Limited.
Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy stand-alone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities.
These loans satisfy arms length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.
3 In preparing the MCEV information, the directors have done so in accordance with the MCEV Principles with the exception of stating held for sale operations at their expected fair value, as represented by expected sale proceeds, less cost to sell.
Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings.
At the end of 2012 we had 21.4 billion 2011: 20.8 billion of total capital employed in our trading operations measured on 3 an MCEV basis.
In May 2012 we issued US$650 million of Fixed Rate Tier 1 Notes.
The Notes are perpetual and may be called from November 2017.
The Notes qualify as Innovative Tier 1 capital under current regulatory rules and are expected to be treated as Fixed Rate Tier 1 capital under Solvency II transitional rules.
The transaction had a positive impact on Group IGD solvency and Economic Capital measures.
In June 2012 US$300 million of Lower Tier 2 floating rate notes were redeemed at first call.
3 Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves, was 35.1% 2011: 36.7%.
Fixed charge cover, which measures the extent to which external interest costs, including subordinated debt interest and preference 3 dividends, are covered by MCEV operating profit was 5.1 times 2011: 8.9 times.
The impact of the agreement to sell Aviva USA has meant that financial leverage under IFRS is higher at 52.6% FY11: 37.1%.

The Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is 6.3% 2011: 7.1% and has been calculated by reference to the cost of equity and the cost of debt at the relevant date.
54 Statement of cash flows This note gives further detail behind the figures in the statement of cash flows.
a The reconciliation of profit before tax to the net cash inflow from operating activities is: 2012 2011 m m Profit before tax from continuing operations 246 373 Adjustments for: Share of loss of joint ventures and associates 277 123 Dividends received from joint ventures and associates 48 71 Profit loss on sale of: Investment property 7 8 Property and equipment 4 Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 164 565 Investments 1,167 1,340 1,010 1,917 Fair value gains losses on: Investment property 492 148 Investments 12,402 5,488 Borrowings 43 1 11,867 5,341 Depreciation of property and equipment 42 54 Equity compensation plans, equity settled expense 42 48 Impairment and expensing of: Goodwill on subsidiaries 109 160 Financial Investments, loans and other assets 46 95 Acquired value of in-force business and intangibles 122 49 Non-financial assets 1 277 305 Amortisation of: Premium or discount on debt securities 105 82 Premium or discount on borrowings 12 3 Premium or discount on non-participating investment contracts 20 45 Financial instruments 64 7 Acquired value of in-force business and intangibles 121 137 298 274 Change in unallocated divisible surplus 6,316 2,721 Interest expense on borrowings 653 689 Net finance charge on pension schemes 82 87 Foreign currency exchange gains losses 128 35 Changes in working capital Increase decrease in reinsurance assets 416 611 Decrease in deferred acquisition costs 216 45 Increase in insurance liabilities and investment contracts 4,325 550 Increase in other assets and liabilities 1,742 1,123 5,867 1,107 Net purchases of operating assets Purchases of investment property 839 1,211 Proceeds on sale of investment property 1,141 717 Net purchases sales of financial investments 1,231 3,264 1,533 3,758 Cash generated from operating activities continuing operations 2,676 111 Cash generated from operating activities discontinued operations 46 27 Total cash generated from operating activities 2,722 138 Operating cash flows reflect the movement in both policyholder and shareholder controlled cash and cash equivalent balances.
Around two thirds of the Groups balances relate to unit-linked or participating policyholder funds.
As such, the asset mix and the level of cash held by these funds are determined from a policyholder perspective and can move significantly from one year to another.
Shareholder cash at 31 December 2012 is at 9.0 billion 2011: 8.6 billion.
Purchases and sales of operating assets, including financial investments, are included within operating cash flows as the purchases are funded from cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of related benefits and claims.
During the year, the net operating cash inflow reflects a number of factors, including changes in the investment strategy of funds to hold a lower weighting of cash and higher levels of financial investments, the level of premium income and the timing of receipts of premiums and the payment of creditors, claims and surrenders.
It also includes changes in the size and value of consolidated cash investment funds and changes in the Group participation in these funds.

Further analysis of the movement in the liabilities of the long-term business can be found in notes 39 and 40.
The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 748 million this is known as RIEESA at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: 1,113 million held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis, therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
252 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 55 Capital statement continued The with-profit funds and the RIEESA use internal hedging to limit the impacts of equity market volatility.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 19.0 billion 2011: 12.3 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year-end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds have available capital of 3.0 billion 2011: 3.0 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 16.0 billion 2011: 9.3 billion is higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
The total available capital of 19.0 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently and includes the Groups unallocated divisible surplus of overseas life operations.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

These realistic liabilities make provision for guarantees, options and promises on a market consistent stochastic basis.
The value of the provision included within realistic liabilities is 1.8 billion, 0.3 billion and 3.5 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively 31 December 2011: 1.9 billion, 0.3 billion and 3.1 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
2 Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2011 was nil, 0.3 billion and 1.6 billion for NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF respectively.
3 This represents the reattributed estate of 0.7 billion at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: 1.1 billion held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations.
4 The WPSF fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 1.7 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the European Economic Area EEA, US, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 253 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 55 Capital statement continued The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profits fund NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
In several business units, Group companies and other parties jointly control certain entities: these joint venture operations may constrain managements ability to utilise the capital in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
56 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses and its shareholders face and describes the Groups approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in the Groups earnings and capital position.
a Risk management framework The risk management framework RMF in Aviva forms an integral part of the management and Board processes and decision-making framework across the Group.
The key elements of our risk management framework comprise risk appetite: risk governance, including risk policies and business standards, risk oversight committees and roles and responsibilities: and the processes we use to identify, measure, manage, monitor and report IMMMR risks, including the use of our risk models and stress and scenario testing.
For the purposes of risk identification and measurement, and aligned to Avivas risk policies, risks are usually grouped by risk type: credit, market, liquidity, life insurance, general insurance, asset management and operational risk.
Risks falling within these types may affect a number of metrics including those relating to balance sheet strength, liquidity and profit.
They may also affect the performance of the products we deliver to our customers and the service to our customers and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to our brand and reputation.
To promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all businesses we have a set of risk policies and business standards which set out the risk strategy, appetite, framework and minimum requirements for the Groups worldwide operations.
On a semi-annual basis the business chief executive officers and chief risk officers sign-off compliance with these policies and standards, providing assurance to the relevant oversight committees that there is a consistent framework for managing our business and the associated risks.
A regular top-town key risk identification and assessment process is carried out by the risk function.
This includes the consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews.
This process is replicated at the business unit level.
The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.
Risk models are an important tool in our measurement of risks and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available.
We carry out a range of stress where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary and scenario where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged.
Roles and responsibilities for risk management in Aviva are based around the three lines of defence model where ownership for risk is taken at all levels in the Group.
Line management in the business is accountable for risk management, including the implementation of the risk management framework and embedding of the risk culture.
The risk function is accountable for quantitative and qualitative oversight and challenge of the IMMMR process and for developing the risk management framework.
Internal Audit provides an independent assessment of the risk framework and internal control processes.
Board oversight of risk and risk management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk the business is willing to take.
Risk appetites are set relative to capital, liquidity and franchise value at Group and in the business units.
Economic capital risk appetites are also set for each risk type.
The Groups position against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The oversight of risk and risk management at the Group level is supported by the Asset Liability Committee ALCO, which focuses on business and financial risks, and the Operational Risk Reputation Committee ORRC which focuses on operational and reputational risks.
Similar committee structures with equivalent terms of reference exist in the business units.
254 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued Further information on the types and management of specific risk types is given in sections b - j below.
The risk management framework of a small number of our joint ventures and strategic equity holdings differs from the Aviva framework outlined in this note.
We work with these entities to understand how risks are managed and to align them, where possible, with Avivas framework.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks.
Credit risk is an area where we can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders.
In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, due to the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.
Our approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements.
Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, bank deposits, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk at business unit and Group level.
All business units are required to implement credit risk management processes including limits frameworks, operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria.
At Group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a Group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.
A detailed breakdown of the Groups current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.
i Financial exposures by credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as sub-investment grade.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure of the Group for financial assets with external credit ratings, excluding assets held for sale.
Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.
The impact of collateral held on the net credit exposure is shown below.

Additional information in respect to collateral is provided in notes 23 c and notes 25 d i.
To the extent that collateral held is greater than the amount receivable that it is securing, the table above shows only an amount equal to the latter.
In the event of default, any over-collateralised security would be returned to the relevant counterparty.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 255 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued ii Financial exposures to peripheral European countries Included in our debt securities and other financial assets, are exposures to peripheral European countries.
Gross of non-controlling interests, our direct shareholder assets exposure to the governments and local authorities and agencies of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain has reduced since 2011 and is detailed in 25 e. We continue to monitor closely the situation in the eurozone and have had additional restrictions on further investment in place since late 2009 as well as taking actions to reduce exposure to higher risk assets.
iii Other investments Other investments including assets of operations classified as held for sale include unit trusts and other investment vehicles: derivative financial instruments, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements: and other assets includes deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.
The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within investment vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds which determine the funds risk profiles.
At the Group level, we also monitor the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles against Group set limits.
A proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable.
Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall appetite for market risk.
iv Loans The Group loan portfolio principally comprises: Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy: Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions.
These loans are fully collateralised by other securities: and Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.
We use loan to value: interest and debt service cover: and diversity and quality of the tenant base metrics to internally monitor our exposures to mortgage loans.
We use credit quality, based on dynamic market measures, and collateralisation rules to manage our stock lending activities.
Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.
v Credit concentration risk The long-term and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations applicable in most markets and the Group credit policy and limits framework, which limit investments in individual assets and asset classes.
Credit concentrations are monitored as part of the regular credit monitoring process and are reported to Group ALCO.
With the exception of government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure within shareholder assets is approximately 1.5% of the total shareholder assets gross of held for sale.
vi Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer.
Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite.
The Group risk function has an active monitoring role with escalation to the Chief Financial Officer CFO, Group ALCO and the Board Risk Committee as appropriate.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd including subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2012, the reinsurance asset recoverable, including debtor balances, from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was 1,717 million.
vii Securities finance The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations in some other businesses.
The risks within this activity are mitigated by  and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements which are designed to minimise residual risk.
The Group operates strict standards around counterparty quality, collateral management, margin calls and controls.
viii Derivative credit exposures The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades.
This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost all trades the exception being certain foreign exchange trades where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise.
Residual exposures are captured within the Groups credit management framework.
ix Unit-linked business In unit-linked business the policyholder bears the direct market risk and credit risk on investment assets in the unit funds and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent of the income arising from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
256 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued x Impairment of financial assets In assessing whether financial assets are impaired, due consideration is given to the factors outlined in accounting policy S. The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.
The table excludes assets held for sale.
Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Financial Neither Greater assets that past due nor 03 36 6 months than have been Carrying impaired months months 1 year 1 year impaired value At 31 December 2012 m m m m m m m Debt securities 128,006 128,006 Reinsurance assets 6,684 6,684 Other investments 28,535 828,543 Loans 23,770 85 68224,537 Receivables and other financial assets 7,518 46 13 14 26 7,617 Financial assets that are past due but not impaired Financial Neither Greater assets that past due nor 03 36 6 months than have been Carrying impaired months months 1 year 1 year impaired value At 31 December 2011 m m m m m m m Debt securities 152,988 264153,252 Reinsurance assets 7,112 7,112 Other investments 30,152 830,160 Loans 27,582 6 52828,116 Receivables and other financial assets 7,650 134 148 2 3 7,937 Where assets have been classed as past due and impaired, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek to mitigate the risk.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
c Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact resulting, directly or indirectly from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity and property prices.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
We actively seek some market risks as part of our investment and product strategy however have limited appetite for interest rate risk as we do not believe it is adequately rewarded.
The management of market risk is undertaken at business unit and at Group level.
Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Group Risk is responsible for monitoring and managing market risk at Group level and has an established criteria for matching assets and liabilities to limit the impact of mismatches due to market movements.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
The most material types of market risk that the Group is exposed to are described below.
i Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk arising from changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
We continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences.
The reduction of the shareholding in Delta Lloyd has decreased the Groups equity price risk and, in particular, has led to a fall in equity exposures.
Our equity hedging programme during 2012 has further reduced our equity exposures.
At a business unit level, investment limits and local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
At 31 December 2012 the Groups shareholder funds held 3 billion notional of equity hedges, with up to 12 months to maturity with an average strike of 88% of the prevailing market levels on 31 December 2012.
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section j risk and capital management below.
ii Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk directly due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and indirectly through investments in mortgages and mortgage backed securities.
Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and is subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders.
As at 31 December 2012, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section j risk and capital management below.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 257 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities.
A number of policyholder product features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 41.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include duration, economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is considered within our scenario testing.
The Group typically manages interest rate risk by investing in fixed interest securities which closely match the interest rate sensitivity of the liabilities where this is available.
Interest rate risk is also managed in some business units using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section j risk and capital management below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 48. iv Inflation risk Inflation risk arises primarily from the Groups exposure to general insurance claims inflation, to inflation linked benefits within the defined benefit staff pension schemes and within the UK annuity portfolio and to expense inflation.
Increases in long-term inflation expectations are closely linked to long-term interest rates and so are frequently considered with interest rate risk.
Exposure to inflation risk is monitored through economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing and stress and scenario testing.
The Group typically manages inflation risk through its investment strategy and, in particular, by investing in inflation linked securities and through a variety of derivative instruments, including inflation linked swaps.
v Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either by unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities or hedging.
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
Businesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
At 31 December 2012 and 2011, the Groups total equity deployment by currency including assets held for sale was: Sterling Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Capital 31 December 2012 4,445 4,648 51 2,31811,360 Capital 31 December 2011 3,427 6,442 3,237 2,257 15,363 A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on total equity.

These balance sheet movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Net asset and profit before tax figures are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.
258 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued vi Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses.
Activity is overseen by the Group risk function, who monitors exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes, or to structure specific retail savings products.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
vii Correlation risk The Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal economic capital model and in scenario analysis.
d Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to make payments as they become due because there are insufficient assets in cash form.
The relatively illiquid nature of insurance liabilities is a potential source of additional investment return by allowing us to invest in higher yielding, but less liquid assets such as commercial mortgages.
The Group seeks to ensure that it maintains sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard.
At Group and business unit level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario.
The Companys main sources of liquidity are liquid assets held within the Company and Aviva Group Holdings Limited AGH, and dividends received from the Groups insurance and asset management businesses.
Sources of liquidity in normal markets also includes a variety of short and long-term instruments including commercial papers and medium and long-term debt.
For 2012 and prior years, the Companys main sources of liquidity also included intercompany loans from Aviva Insurance Limited and Aviva International Insurance Limited, subject to regulatory constraints.
In addition to the existing liquid resources and expected inflows, the Group and Company maintain significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities 2.1 billion from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.
Maturity analyses The following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets to meet them.
A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivatives is given in notes 48 and 57, respectively.
Contractual obligations under operating leases and capital commitments are given in note 52. i Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2012 and 2011 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Almost all linked business and non-linked investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.
We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and the tables reflect the expected cash flows for these contracts.
However, contractually, the total liability for linked business and non-linked investment contracts would be shown in the within 1 year column below, and previously the total liability for linked business was shown in the within 1 year column.
Changes in durations between 2011 and 2012 reflect evolution of the portfolio, and changes to the models for projecting cash-flows.

There is no impact on the result for any year presented as a result of this classification.
2 Linked business maturity profile has been restated to reflect an expected rather than contractual basis.
Contractually, the total liability for linked business would be shown in the within 1 year column.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 259 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued ii Analysis of maturity of financial assets The following table provides an analysis, by maturity date of the principal, of the carrying value of financial assets which are available to fund the repayment of liabilities as they crystallise.
This table excludes assets held for sale.
Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the On demand or within 1 year column.
Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument.
The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis.
The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance.
Most of the Groups investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.
e Life insurance risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity risks and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
The Group chooses to take measured amounts of life insurance risk provided that the relevant business has the appropriate core skills to assess and price the risk and adequate returns are available.
The underlying risk profile of our life insurance risks, primarily persistency, longevity, mortality and expense risk, has remained stable during 2012, although the current low levels of interest rates have increased our sensitivity to longevity shocks.
Persistency risk remains significant and continues to have a volatile outlook with underlying performance linked to some degree to economic conditions.
However, businesses across the Group have continued to make progress with a range of customer retention activities.
The Group has continued to write strong volumes of life protection business, and to utilise reinsurance to reduce exposure to potential losses.
More generally, life insurance risks are believed to benefit from a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio.
Life insurance risks are modelled within the internal economic capital model and subject to sensitivity and stress and scenario testing.
The assumption and management of life insurance risks is governed by the group-wide business standards covering underwriting, pricing, product design and management, in-force management, claims handling, and reinsurance.
The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows businesses to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but retains oversight of the overall exposures and monitor that the aggregation of risk ceded is within credit risk appetite.
Longevity risk and internal experience analysis are monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and any associated capital implications.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, and benchmarked against local market information.
Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.
The Group has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.
260 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in the economic capital model and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
f General insurance risk Types of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: Unexpected claims arising from a single source or cause: Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten: and Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques.
Aviva has a preference for general insurance risk in measured amounts for explicit reward, in line with our core skills in underwriting and pricing.
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group continues to be short tail in nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is communicated via specific policy statements, related business standards and guidelines.
General insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at the Group level.
Claims reserving is undertaken by local actuaries in the various general insurance businesses and is also subject to periodic external reviews.
Reserving processes are further detailed in note 39 insurance liabilities.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported under the risk management framework.
Additionally, the economic capital model is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The business units are assisted by a Business Capability team who provide technical input for major decisions which fall outside individual delegated limits or escalations outside group risk preferences, group risk accumulation, concentration and profitability limits.
Reinsurance strategy Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of economic capital, economic gain, earnings volatility, liquidity, retained risk exposure profile and the Groups franchise value.
Detailed actuarial analysis is used to calculate the Groups extreme risk profile and then design cost and capital efficient reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites.
For businesses writing general insurance we analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using external probabilistic catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the re insurance industry.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third-party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
The total Group potential loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure zone Northern Europe is approximately 260 million, for a one in ten year annual loss scenario, compared to approximately 460 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
In our 2011 Annual Report & Accounts we reported our participation in a share of Hiscoxs US property catastrophe portfolio.
This arrangement expired on the 31 December 2012 and remaining exposure will run off during 2013. g Asset management risk Asset Management risk arises through exposure to negative investment performance, fund liquidity, and factors that influence franchise value such as product development appropriateness and capability, and client retention.
The Groups exposure to asset management risk is informed through regular assessment of the investment management capabilities and proven track record of the investment funds.
Aviva is directly exposed to the risks associated with operating an asset management business through its ownership of Aviva Investors.
The underlying risk profile of our asset management risk is derived from investment performance, specialist investment professionals and leadership, product development capabilities, fund liquidity, margin, client retention, regulatory developments, fiduciary and contractual responsibilities.
Investment performance has remained strong over 2012 despite some positions being impacted by the volatility of global markets.
Essential read Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Other information 261 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued Action has been taken during the year to improve the operational infrastructure and enhance the quality of the customer experience including: progressing towards the implementation of the Blackrock Aladdin platform to support our investment process: review of our Business Development capability: and a continued drive to work closely with clients.
h Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss, arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events including changes in the regulatory environment.
We have limited appetite for operational risk and aim to reduce these risks as far as is commercially sensible.
Our business units are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks within their businesses, within the group-wide operational risk framework including the risk and control self-assessment process.
Businesses must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk tolerances are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events, taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning.
i Brand and reputation risk We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation.
Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us or any of our intermediaries do not perform as expected whether or not the expectations are founded or the customers expectations for the product change.
We seek to reduce this risk to as low a level as commercially sensible.
The FSA regularly considers whether we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints.
Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation.
If we do not manage the perception of our brands and reputation successfully, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to choose not to do business with us.
j Risk and capital management i Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity tests to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on the Groups key financial performance metrics to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of market consistent performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
ii Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
iii General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.
iv Sensitivity test results Illustrative results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
262 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual report and accounts 2012 56 Risk management continued Sensitivity factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by a 1% increase or decrease.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market value of backing fixed interest securities.
Credit spreads The impact of a 0.5% increase in credit spreads over risk-free interest rates on corporate bonds and other non-sovereign credit assets.
The test allows for any consequential impact on liability valuations Equity property market values The impact of a change in equity property market values by 10%.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Assurance mortality morbidity life insurance only The impact of an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.

The sensitivities to economic movements excluding the United States relate mainly to business in the UK.
In general, a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
The mortality sensitivities also relate primarily to the UK.
In the United States, most debt securities are classified as AFS for which movements in unrealised gains or losses are taken directly to shareholders equity.
This limited the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate and credit spread movements.
Following the classification of the business as held for sale in 2012 it was remeasured to fair value less costs to sell.
It has been assumed that economic movements would not materially impact the fair value less costs to sell and the impact on shareholders equity is therefore reported as nil.
As a result, were economic movements to occur, the corresponding movements in AFS assets which would be taken directly to shareholders equity, are reversed out through profit before tax in order to maintain the remeasurement value of the US at fair value less costs to sell.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
57 Derivative financial instruments and hedging This note gives details of the various instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties.
a Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its instruments qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
To aid discussion and analysis, these instruments are analysed into cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as detailed below.
i Cash flow hedges At the end of 2012 the Group entered into two cash flow hedges, using foreign exchange forward and option contracts, to hedge the currency exposure on expected proceeds in 2013 of businesses held for sale as at 31 December 2012.
The fair value of the cash flow hedges as of 31 December 2012 was a 5 million derivative asset.
No amounts in respect of the cash flow hedges have been recognised in the income statement for the year.
All cash flows being hedged upon transaction completion are expected to occur and movements in the fair value will be recycled to the income statement in 2013.
These hedges were fully effective in the year.
ii Fair value hedges The Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps in order to hedge fluctuations in the fair value part of its portfolio of mortgage loans and debt securities in the US.
The notional value of these swaps was 765 million at 31 December 2012 2011: 844 million and their fair value was 54 million liability 2011: 77 million liability.
During 2012, there were hedging relationships that became ineffective.
The amount of ineffectiveness included in the income statement as a result was 14 million.
The related hedges were re-designated and are expected to be effective in future periods.

The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2012 was 1,741 million 2011: 1,815 million and its fair value at that date was 1,785 million 2011: 1,694 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 74 million 2011: gain of 30 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior years.
b Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.
These are referred to below as non-hedge derivatives.
5,478 million notional of credit derivatives and their related fair values have been reclassified out of the other and interest rate swap categories to the credit contracts category.
Additionally 3,156 million notional of inflation linked swaps have been reclassified out of the interest rate swap category to the other category.
Fair value assets are recognised as Derivative financial instruments in note 25 a, while fair value liabilities are recognised as Derivative liabilities in note 49.
Fair value assets in note 25 a of 1,590 million represent non-hedge derivative assets of 1,585 million per the table above plus 5 million of cash flow hedges.
Fair value liabilities in note 49 of 1,761 million represent non-hedge derivative liabilities of 1,707 million per the table above plus 54 million of fair value hedges.
The Groups derivative risk management policies are outlined in note 56. ii The contractual undiscounted cash flows in relation to non-hedge derivative liabilities have the following maturities: 2012 2011 m m Within 1 year 534 226 Between 1 and 2 years 434 144 Between 2 and 3 years 158 135 Between 3 and 4 years 387 123 Between 4 and 5 years 113 355 After 5 years 1,787 1,911 3,413 2,894 c Collateral Certain derivative contracts, primarily interest rate and currency swaps, involve the receipt or pledging of cash and non-cash collateral.
The amounts of cash collateral receivable or repayable are included in notes 26 and 49 respectively.
