92 | Alliance Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2012 Company Financial Performance A seven year record of the Companys Financial Performance is provided below.
Prior to the financial year ended 31 January 2007 there were two trusts, The Alliance Trust and The Second Alliance Trust, and the figures are therefore not directly comparable.
This explains why we have only shown a seven year record.
Our intention is over time to extend this to a 10 year record.
