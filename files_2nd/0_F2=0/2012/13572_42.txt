Provisions for contract loss and restructuring are generally expected to be utilised within two years.
Customer financing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or financing.
These guarantees are considered to be insurance contracts in nature and provision is made in accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the heading Customer financing in the Chief Financial Officers review on page 14.
The related contingent liabilities arising from these guarantees and the sensitivity to movements in the value of the underlying security are discussed in note 23.
It is estimated that the provision will be utilised as follows: 2012 2011 m m Potential claims with specific claim dates: In one year or less 30 12 In more than one year but less than five years 43 62 In more than five years 8 6 Potential claims that may arise at any time up to the date of expiry of the guarantee: Up to one year Up to five years 1 1 Thereafter 82 81 The Groups captive insurance company retains a portion of the exposures it insures on behalf of the remainder of the Group.
Significant delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
19 Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
For the UK defined benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on either their final or career average salaries and length of service.
Overseas defined benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees.

This is a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there is a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 36m 2011 35m in the year.

The Consumer Price Index is assumed to be 0.6 per cent lower.
The discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
For the main schemes, the rate is determined by using the profile of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
For other schemes, the rate is determined as the market yield at the average duration of the forecast benefit payments.
The discount rates above are the weighted average of those for each scheme, based on the value of their respective liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual returns expected from each asset class see below in accordance with the actual asset balance in the schemes investment portfolios.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the SAP actuarial tables, with future improvements in line with the CMI 2011 core projections and long-term improvements of 1.25 per cent.
Where appropriate, these are adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
The resulting range of life expectancies in the principal UK schemes are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 Current pensioner 20.8 years Future pensioner currently aged 45 22.4 years Other demographic assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the schemes.
Assumptions in respect of overseas schemes are also set in accordance with advice from local actuaries.
The future costs of healthcare benefits are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 7.9 per cent grading down to 5.0 per cent over 6.7 years.

It will be amortised over the remaining service lives of the participants 11.3 years.
2 W here a surplus has arisen on a scheme, in accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14, the surplus is recognised as an asset only if it represents an unconditional economic benefit available to the Group in the future.
Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
3 A mi nimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements require future contributions in respect of past service that will result in a future unrecognisable surplus.

2 U nder the longevity swap, the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund has agreed an average life expectancy of pensioners with a counterparty.
If pensioners live longer than expected the counterparty will make payments to the Fund to offset the additional cost of paying pensioners.
If the reverse applies, the cost of paying pensioners will be reduced but the scheme will be required to make payments to the counterparty.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return for LDI portfolios are determined by the implicit yields on the portfolios at the balance sheet date and that for the longevity swap by the discount rate.
R olls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2012 114 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 19 Post-retirement benefits continued The expected rates of return on other individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to gilt yields.
In the UK, equities and corporate bonds are assumed to generate returns that exceed the return from gilts by 3.25 per cent and 0.9 per cent per annum respectively.
The expected rates of return above are the weighted average of the rates for each scheme.
Future contributions The Group expects to contribute approximately 290m to its defined benefit schemes in 2013.
Sensitivities For the most significant schemes, the investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and inflation on an economic basis.
The impacts of principal sensitivities are: 2012 2011 m m 1 UK defined benefit obligations 0.25% reduction in the discount rate 319 298 1 UK defined benefit assets 0.25% reduction in interest rates 458 463 UK defined benefit obligations Age ratings increase by one year 199 163 UK defined benefit longevity swap Age ratings increase by one year 68 62 UK defined benefit obligations 0.5% increase in rate of increase in salaries 197 127 Post-retirement medical benefit obligations 1% increase in healthcare trend rates 49 45 Post-retirement medical benefit obligations 1% decrease in healthcare trend rates 41 56 Post-retirement medical benefit expense 1% increase in healthcare trend rates 4 4 Post-retirement medical benefit expense 1% decrease in healthcare trend rates 3 5 1 T he difference arises largely due to differences in the methods used to value the obligations for accounting and economic purposes.
On an economic basis the correlation is approximately 97 per cent.
