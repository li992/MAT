Segment information Management has determined the operating segments based on the analysis used to make strategic decisions.
Business segment analysis The Group is organised on a worldwide basis into three main segments, based on the services and products offered: Risk & Insurance, Employee Benefits and Head Office & Other operations.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting structure of the Group.
The Risk & Insurance segment comprises JLTs global specialist, wholesale, reinsurance broking, personal lines and SME activities.
The Employee Benefits segment consists of pension administration, outsourcing and employee benefits consultancy, healthcare and wealth management activities.
Certain Risk & Insurance and Employee Benefits operating segments have not been reported separately as they do not meet the quantitative thresholds contained in IFRS8.
The Head Office & Other segment consists mainly of holding companies, central administration functions, the Group's captive insurance companies and the Group's principal investments in associates.
Segment results Management assesses the performance of the operating segments based upon a measure of underlying trading profit.
Segment results include the net income or expense derived from the trading activities of the segment together with the investment income earned on fiduciary funds.
Interest income on the Groups own funds and finance costs are excluded since the trading activities of the Group's primary segments are not of a financial nature.
Income tax expense and the change in respect of non-controlling interests is excluded from the segmental allocation.
Segment assets and liabilities Assets and liabilities are not allocated to individual segments and are therefore all reported within Head Office & Other.
Investments in associates On 14th March 2012, the Group acquired 25 per cent of March-Unipsa, renamed March-JLT, which operates mainly in Spain.
On 31st December 2011, the Group acquired 25 per cent of the Marine & Aviation Group, renamed MAG-JLT, which operates mainly in Italy.
Following a restructuring in July 2011, the Group increased its stake in the holding company of Siaci Saint Honor, which operates principally in France, from 20 to 26 per cent.
In 2010, the Group acquired 20 per cent of the Austrian company GrECo which operates mainly in Austria and Eastern Europe.
The investment and the Groups share of the net profit of Siaci Saint Honor, GrECo, MAG-JLT and March-JLT are included in the Head Office & Other segment, together with the investment and results of the Groups other associates, Sterling Re Intermediaro fide Reaseguro SA fide CV and JLT Insurance Management Malta.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
The Group has presented the segmental information in 2012 to reflect changes to the internal Group reporting structure and the information reviewed by the chief operating decision-maker.
In light of these changes the comparatives for 2011 have been restated.
These changes result in the former London Market businesses, the insurance broking and risk services businesses of the former Retail segment and Thistle Insurance Services being reported as Risk & Insurance.
The Employee Benefits businesses of Australia, Latin America, Asia and Canada which were previously reported within the Retail segment are now reported as Employee Benefits.
In addition, assets and liabilities are now reported within Head Office and Other.
Comparatives for 2011 have been restated accordingly.
These have had no impact on the results.

Employee information continued JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 The Group operates the Long Term Incentive Plan for Executive Directors and persons discharging managerial responsibility PDMR's.
Awards under the scheme are granted in the form of nil-priced options and are satisfied using market-purchased shares.
The awards vest in full or in part depending on satisfaction of the performance conditions which are set out on page 48 of the remuneration report.
The awards have a 3 year performance period and have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Senior Executive Share Scheme The Group operates a Senior Executive Share Scheme for senior management and employees.
The majority of awards have no specific performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that employees remain in employment with the group.
Certain awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
The awards have a 10 year life from the date of grant.
Executive Share Option Scheme Options were granted at a fixed price usually market price and are exercisable after the vesting period usually 3 years.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or using market-purchased shares.
Some options carry performance conditions where they are only exercisable when earnings per share is in excess of RPI for the three consecutive financial accounting periods preceding the date of exercise.
This scheme is now closed for new grants and options were last granted under this scheme on 29th September 2006.
Sharesave Schemes The Sharesave Scheme is open to all employees and are exercised after either 3 or 5 years from the date of grant.
The price at which options are offered is not less than 80% of the market price on the date preceding the date of invitation.
All Sharesave Scheme options have no performance criteria attached, other than the requirement that the employee remains in employment with the Group.
All options must be exercised within 6 months of the vesting date.
Fair Value of Awards Under IFRS 2 the fair value of awards granted during the year, calculated using a Black-Scholes model, is shown on the following table: Black-Scholes model assumptions Exercise Share price on Dividend Risk free Fair value of price Performance grant date Volatility yield Maturity interest rate one award p period p% % years %p JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 Senior Executive Share Scheme 2012 29 March - 2012-17 692.50 22.35 - 2-5 1.06 692.50 2012 10 September - 2012-17 745.50 22.03 - 3-5 0.60 745.50 The option holders who have awards under the Senior Executive Share Scheme also receive discretionary payments equating to the dividends payable on their shares subject to meeting the performance criteria.
Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using either a 3 or 5 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group's employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
For Executive Share Option and Sharesave schemes this is 20%.
For the JLT Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 and the Senior Executive Share Scheme it is nil as both are issued with no cost to the employee.

The Audit & Risk Committee has a policy on the use of the external auditors for non-audit services to ensure that the auditor's independence is maintained and that appropriate approvals are sought for non-audit services depending upon their nature and value.
Each year a limit is set on the total fees that can be paid to the external auditor in relation to non-audit services.
For 2012 the Audit & Risk Committee has set this limit at 1 million 2011: 1 million.

The UK Government has announced various measures in relation to UK corporation tax including a 2% reduction in the headline rate of corporation tax from April 2012, and reductions of 1% in 2013 and 2% in 2014.
The future reduction will reduce the UK tax rate from 24% to 21%.
As at 31st December 2012 the 2% rate reduction to 24% is already in force and only the first subsequent 1% rate reduction has been substantively enacted.
Therefore the impact of the remaining 2% reduction has not been incorporated into the income tax charge for the year ended 31st December 2012.

Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are categorised according to their nature into one of two categories: 1 Investments and deposits consist mainly of fixed term deposits, bonds and certificates of deposit.
These investments are held at fair value and are classified between current and non-current assets according to maturity date.
2 Other investments include securities and other investments held for strategic purposes.
These investments are held at fair value unless a fair value cannot be accurately determined in which case they are held at cost less any provision for impairment.

A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.
These instruments are included in level 1.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
