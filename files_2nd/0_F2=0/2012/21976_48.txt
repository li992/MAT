Awards under the ISP are valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
TSRs were generated for BT Group plc and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each companys volatility and dividend yield, as well as the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.
Volatility has been determined by reference to BT Group plcs historical volatility which is expected to reect the BT Group plc share price in the future.
An expected life of three months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Sharesave options and for all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.
The fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the date of grant.
The weighted average share price for DBP awards granted in 2012 was 198p 2011: 131p, 2010: 131p.
