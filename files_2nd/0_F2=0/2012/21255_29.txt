Applicable taxes in Georgia and Belarus include corporate income tax profit tax, individuals withholding taxes, property tax and value added tax, among others.
However, regulations are often unclear or non-existent and few precedents have been established.
This creates tax risks in Georgia and Belarus, substantially more significant than typically found in countries with more developed tax systems.
Management believes that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws affecting its operations.
However, the risk remains that relevant authorities could take differing positions with regard to interpretative issues.

On 24 February 2012 EBRD and IFC utilised the convertibility feature and converted US$ 49,903 thousand of their loans to the Bank into the Banks shares Note 18.
Total number of ordinary shares issued under this transaction comprised 3,635,006.
On 28 February 2012 the Group completed the Tender Offer under which 35,909,383 of the Banks shares then outstanding or 98.35 per cent were converted into 35,909,383 shares of BGH Note 1.
Share capital of the Group was paid by the shareholders in Georgian Lari and they were entitled to dividends in Georgian Lari before the Tender Offer and are entitled to dividends in British Pound Sterling after the Tender Offer.
Capital Reduction Following the Admission Note 1, the Directors of BGH undertook a reduction of capital in order to create distributable reserves for BGH.
The original difference between the nominal value of BGHs shares and the fair value of the Banks shares was credited to the merger reserve created in connection with the Tender Offer.
It was the intention of BGHs Directors that the maximum amount of distributable reserves should be created and therefore any merger reserve created in connection with the Tender Offer was capitalised into Class A shares.
The Class A shares were allotted pro rata to holders of BGH shares.
BGH Directors implemented a Court approved reduction of capital which reduced the original Tender Offer nominal value of BGH shares and cancelled all the Class A shares in issue resulting from the capitalisation of the merger reserve.
BGH shares had an original Tender Offer nominal value of GBP 6.00 per share.
Following the reduction of capital the nominal value of BGH shares was reduced to GBP 0.01.
Reduction of the capital created a new reserve on the statement of financial position of BGH comprising the reduction of the original nominal value from GBP 6.00 to GBP 0.01 per share plus aggregate nominal amount of all of the Class A shares which were cancelled.
The reduction of capital is a legal and accounting adjustment and did not, of itself, have any direct impact on the market value of BGH shares.
As a result of the capital reduction in BGH, the Groups total additional paid-in capital outstanding at the time became distributable to the shareholders and was fully reclassified to retained earnings.

Risk Management Introduction Risk is inherent in the Groups activities but it is managed through a process of ongoing identification, measurement and monitoring, subject to risk limits and other controls.
This process of risk management is critical to the Groups continuing profitability and each individual within the Group is accountable for the risk exposures relating to his or her responsibilities.
The Group is exposed to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk, the latter being subdivided into trading and non-trading risks.
It is also subject to operational risks.
The independent risk control process does not include business risks such as changes in the environment, technology and industry.
They are monitored through the Groups strategic planning process.
Risk management structure Audit Committee The Audit Committee is an independent body and is directly monitored by the Board.
It has the overall responsibility for developing and implementation ofoverall risk assessment and risk mitigation strategies, principles, frameworks, policies and limits.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the fundamental risk issues and manages and monitors relevant risk decisions covering, but not limited to: macroeconomic and environmental risks, general control environment, manual and application controls, risks of intentionally or unintentional misstatements, risk of fraud or misappropriation of assets, information security, anti-money laundering, information technology risks, etc.
Management Board The Management Board has the responsibility to monitor and manage entire risk process within the Group, on a regular basis, by assigning tasks, creating different executive committees, designing and setting up risk management policies and procedures as well as respective guidelines and controlling their implementation and performance of relevant departments and committees.
Bank Asset and Liability Management Committee The Banks Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO is the core risk management body.
It is responsible formanaging the Banks assets and liabilities, all risks associated with them as well as overall financial structure of the Group.
It is also primarily responsible for the funding, capital adequacy risk, liquidity risks and market risks of the Bank.
Internal Audit Risk management processes throughout the Group are audited annually by the internal audit function that examines both the adequacy of the procedures and the Groups compliance with the procedures.
Internal Audit discusses the results of all assessments with management, and reports its findings and recommendations to the Audit Committee.
Risk measurement and reporting systems The Groups risks are measured using a method which reflects both the expected loss likely to arise in normal circumstances and unexpected losses, which are an estimate of the ultimate actual loss based on different forecasting models.
The models make use of probabilities derived from historical experience, adjusted to reflect the economic environment.
The Group runs three different basic scenarios, of which one is Base Case forecast under normal business conditions and the other two are Troubled and Distressed Scenarios, which are worse and the worst case scenarios, respectively, that would arise in the event that extreme events which are unlikely to occur do, in fact, occur.
Monitoring and controlling risks is primarily performed based on limits established by the Group.
These limits reflect thebusiness strategy and market environment of the Group as well as the level of risk that the Group is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on selected industries.
In addition, the Group monitors and measures the overall risk bearing capacity in relation to the aggregate risk exposure across all risk types and activities.
Information compiled from all the businesses is examined and processed in order to analyse, control and identify early risks.
This information is presented and explained to the Management Board, and the head of each business division.
The reports include aggregate credit exposures and their limits, exceptions to those limits, liquidity ratios and liquidity limits, market risk ratios and their limits, and changes to the risk profile.
Senior management assesses the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a monthly basis.
The Management Board receives a comprehensive Credit Risk report and ALCO report once a month.
These reports are designed to provide all the necessary information to assess and conclude on the risks of the Group.
For all levels throughout the Group, specifically tailored risk reports are prepared and distributed in order to ensure that allbusiness divisions have access to extensive, relevant and up-to-date information.
A daily briefing is given to the Management Board and all other relevant employees of the Group on the utilisation of market limits, proprietary investments and liquidity, plus any other risk developments.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 159 Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued Thousands of Georgian Lari 27.
Risk Management continued Risk mitigation As part of its overall risk management, the Group uses derivatives and other instruments to manage exposures resultingfrom changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, equity risks, credit risks, and exposures arising from forecasttransactions.
While these are intended for hedging, these do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The Group actively uses collateral to reduce its credit risks see below for more detail.
Excessive risk concentration Concentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or these counterparties represent related parties to each other, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
Concentrations also involve combined, aggregate exposures of large and significant credits compared to the total outstanding balance of the respective financial instrument.
Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Groups performance to developments affecting a particular industry or geographical location.
In order to avoid excessive concentrations of risks, the Groups policies and procedures include specific guidelines to focus on maintaining a diversified portfolio of both, financial assets as well as financial liabilities.
Identified concentrations of credit risks or liquidity repayment risks are controlled and managed accordingly.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group will incur a loss because its customers, clients or counterparties failed to discharge their contractual obligations.
The Group manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical, industry, product and currency concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits.
The Group has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions.
Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating.
Risk ratings are subject to regular revision.
The credit quality review process allows the Group to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action.
Derivative financial instruments Credit risk arising from derivative financial instruments is, at any time, limited to those with positive fair values, as recorded in the statement of the financial position.
Credit-related commitments risks The Group makes available to its customers guarantees which may require that the Group make payments on their behalf.
Such payments are collected from customers based on the terms of the letter of credit.
They expose the Group tosimilar risks to loans and these are mitigated by the same control processes and policies.
160 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information Credit quality per class of financial assets The credit quality of financial assets is managed by the Group through internal credit ratings.
The table below shows the credit quality by class of asset for loan-related lines in the statement of financial position, based on the Groups credit rating system.
These loans are not impaired.
It is the Groups policy to maintain accurate and consistent risk ratings across the credit portfolio.
This facilitates focused management of the applicable risks and the comparison of credit exposures across all lines of business, geographic regions and products.
The rating system is supported by a variety of financial analytics to provide the main inputs for the measurement of counterparty risk.
All internal risk ratings are tailored to the various categories and are derived in accordance with the Groups rating policy.
Attributable risk ratings are assessed and updated regularly.
The credit risk assessment policy for non-past due and individually non-impaired financial assets has been determined by the Group as follows: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due no more than 30 days is assessed as a financial asset with High Grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 30 but less than 60 days is assessed as a financial asset with Standard Grade: A financial asset that is neither past due nor impaired at the reporting date, but historically used to be past due more than 60days or borrower of this loan has at least an additional borrowing in past due more than 60 days as at reporting date is assessed as a financial asset with Sub-Standard Grade.

The Group specifically monitors performance of the loans with overdue payments in arrears for more than 90 days.
The gross carrying value i. e. carrying value before deducting any allowance for impairment of such loans comprised GEL 82,524, GEL 87,836 and GEL 117,580 as at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, respectively.

The Group addresses impairment assessment in two areas: individually assessed allowances and collectively assessed allowances.
Loans are considered to be individually impaired if they are past due by more than only a few days or there are clear indications that the borrower already faces business, financial or other type of problems that hinder its his her ability to serve contractual obligations with the Group.
Impairment for all such loans is assessed individually, rather than applying standard collective impairment rates based on just prior history of losses of the Group.
Individually assessed allowances For loan loss allowance determination purposes the Group considers all individually significant loans and classifies them between being individually impaired or not impaired.
The allowance for those individually significant loans that are determined to be individually impaired see definition above is determined through individual assessment of the associated credit risk by assigning a proper credit rating.
The allowances for non-significant loan that are determined to be individually impaired see definition above are also individually assessed.
The allowance for losses for individually significant loans that are determined not to be individually impaired is assessed through the collective assessment approach described below.
Items considered when determining allowance amounts include the sustainability of the counterpartys business plan, its ability to improve performance once a financial difficulty has arisen, projected receipts and the expected dividend payout should bankruptcy ensue, the availability of other financial support and the realisable value of collateral, the timing of the expected cash flows and past history of the debt service of the borrower.
Impairment losses are evaluated at each reporting date, unless unforeseen circumstances require more careful attention.
Collectively assessed allowances Allowances are assessed collectively for all loans including but not limited to credit cards, residential mortgages, and unsecured consumer lending, commercial lending, etc.
both, significant as well as non-significant, where there is not yet objective evidence of individual impairment see definition above.
Allowances are evaluated on each reporting date with each portfolio receiving a separate review.
The collective assessment takes into account the impairment that is likely to be present in the portfolio even though there is not yet objective evidence of the impairment in an individual assessment.
Impairment losses are estimated by taking into consideration the following information: historical losses on the portfolio, current economic conditions, the appropriate delay between the time a loss is likely to have been uncured and the time it will be identified as requiring an individually assessed impairment allowance, and expected receipts and recoveries once impaired.
Local management is responsible for deciding the length of this period which can extend for as long as one year, depending on a product.
The impairment allowance is then reviewed by credit management to ensure alignment with the Groups overall policy.
Financial guarantees and letters of credit are assessed and provision made in a similar manner as for loans.
To limit this risk, management has arranged diversified funding sources in addition to its coredeposit base, manages assets with liquidity in mind, and monitors future cash flows and liquidity on a regular basis.
This incorporates an assessment of expected cash flows and the availability of high grade collateral which couldbe used to secure additional funding if required.
The Group maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that can be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption of cash flow.
The Group also has committed lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs.
In addition, the Group maintains a cash deposit obligatory reserve with the NBG, the amount of which depends on the level of customer funds attracted.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 165 Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued Thousands of Georgian Lari 27.
Risk Management continued The liquidity position is assessed and managed by the Group primarily on a standalone Bank basis, based on certain liquidity ratios established by the NBG.
As at 31 December these ratios were as follows: 2012 % 2011 % 2010 % Average liquidity ratio 40.0% 36.9% 35.6% Maximum liquidity ratio 49.1% 47.2% 44.5% Minimum liquidity ratio 31.1% 29.6% 29.1% The average liquidity ratio is calculated on a standalone basis for JSC Bank of Georgia as the annual average arithmetic mean of daily liquidity ratios computed as the ratio of liquid assets to liabilities determined by the National Bank of Georgia as follows: Liquid assets comprise cash, cash equivalents and other assets that are immediately convertible into cash.
Those assets include investment securities issued by the Georgian Government plus Certificates of Deposit issued by NBG and do not include amounts due from credit institutions, other than inter-bank deposits, and or debt securities of Governments and Central Banks of non-OECD countries, amounts in nostro accounts which are under lien, impaired inter-bank deposits: and amounts on obligatory reserve with NBG that are pledged due to borrowings from NBG.
Liabilities comprise the total balance sheet liabilities, less amounts due to credit institutions that are to be exercised or settled later than six months from the reporting date, plus off-balance sheet commitments with residual maturity subsequent to the reporting date of less than six months.
Off-balance sheet commitments include all commitments except financial guarantees and letters of credit that are fully collateralised by cash covers in the Bank, and commitments due to dealing operations with foreign currencies.
The maximum and minimum liquidity ratio are taken from historical data of the appropriate reporting years.
The Group also matches the maturity of financial assets and financial liabilities and imposes a maximum limit on negative gaps compared to the Banks standalone total regulatory capital calculated per NBG regulation.
The ratios are assessed and monitored monthly and compared against set limits.
In the case of deviations amendment strategies actions are discussed and approved by ALCO.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
Repayments which are subject to notice are treated as if notice were to be given immediately.
However, the Group expects that many customers will not request repayment on the earliest date the Bank could be required to pay and the table does not reflect the expected cash flows indicated by the Banks deposit retention history.

The maturity analysis does not reflect the historical stability of current accounts.
Their liquidation has historically taken place over a longer period than indicated in the tables above.
These balances are included in amounts due in less than three months in the tables above.
Included in due to customers are term deposits of individuals.
In accordance with the Georgian legislation, the Bank Group is obliged to repay such deposits upon demand of a depositor Note 17.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in market variables such as interest rates, foreign exchanges, and equity prices.
The Group classifies exposures to market risk into either trading or non-trading portfolios.
Trading and non-trading positions are managed and monitored using sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of financial instruments.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the Groups consolidated income statement.
The sensitivity of the consolidated income statement is the effect of the assumed changes in interest rates on the net interest income for the year, based on the floating rate non-trading financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31December2012.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, year ended 31 December 2011 and year ended 31December 2010, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.

The Management Board has set limits on positions by currency based on the NBG regulations.
The tables below indicate the currencies to which the Group had significant exposure at 31 December 2012 on its trading and non-trading monetary assets and liabilities and its forecast cash flows.
The analysis calculates the effect of a reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari, with all other variables held constant on the income statement due to the fair value of currency sensitive non-trading monetary assets and liabilities.
The reasonably possible movement of the currency rate against the Georgian Lari is calculated as a standard deviation of daily changes in exchange rates over the last month.
A negative amount in the table reflects a potential net reduction in income statement or equity, while a positive amount reflects a net potential increase.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, year ended 31 December 2011 and year ended 31 December 2010, sensitivity analysis did not reveal any significant potential effect on the Groups equity.

The Group calculates the effect of early repayments by calculating the weighted average rates of early repayments across each loan product individually, applying these historical rates to the outstanding carrying amount of respective products as at the reporting date and multiplying by the weighted average effective annual interest rates for each product.
The model does not make a distinction between different reasons for repayment e. g. relocation, refinancing and renegotiation and takes into account the effect of any prepayment penalties, as the Groups income.
168 Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial Statements Additional Information The estimated effect of prepayment risk on profit and equity of the Group for the year ended 31 December is as follows: Effect on net interest income 2012 3,971 2011 5,416 2010 67,605 Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from systems failure, human error, fraud or external events.
When controls fail to perform, operational risks can cause damage to reputation, have legal or regulatory implications, or lead to financial loss.
The Group cannot expect to eliminate all operational risks, but through a control framework and by monitoring and responding to potential risks, the Group is able to manage the risks.
Controls include effective segregation of duties, access, authorisation and reconciliation procedures, staff education and assessment processes, including the use of internal audit.
Operating environment Most of the Groups business in concentrated in Georgia.
As an emerging market, Georgia does not possess a well-developed business and regulatory infrastructure that would generally exist in a more mature market economy.
Operations in Georgia may involve risks that are not typically associated with those in developed markets including the risk that the Georgian Lari is not freely convertible outside the country, and undeveloped debt and equity markets.
However, over the last few years the Georgian government has made a number of developments that positively affect the overall investment climate of the country, specifically implementing the reforms necessary to create banking, judicial, taxation and regulatory systems.
This includes the adoption of a new body of legislation including new Tax Code and procedural laws.
In the view of the Board, these steps contribute to mitigate the risks of doing business in Georgia.
The existing tendency aimed at the overall improvement of the business environment is expected to persist.
The future stability of the Georgian economy is largely dependent upon these reforms and developments and the effectiveness of economic, financial and monetary measures undertaken by the Government.
However, the Georgian economy is vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in the world.
Fair Values of Financial Instruments Financial instruments recorded at fair value The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuationtechnique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

These incorporate the Groups estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates and interest rate curves.
Trading securities and investment securities available-for-sale Trading securities and investment securities available-for-sale valued using a valuation technique or pricing models primarily consist of unquoted equity and debt securities.
These securities are valued using models which sometimes only incorporate data observable in the market and at other times use both observable and non-observable data.
The non-observable inputs to the models include assumptions regarding the future financial performance of the investee, itsrisk profile, and economic assumptions regarding the industry and geographical jurisdiction in which the investeeoperates.

Fair Values of Financial Instruments continued The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements.
Assets for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short term maturity less than thee months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate to their fair value.
This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates offered for similar financial instruments.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money-market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities The table below shows an analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to when they are expected to be recovered or settled.
See Note 27 Risk management for the Groups contractual undiscounted repayment obligations.
In the Georgian marketplace, where most of the Groups business is concentrated, many short-term credits are granted with the expectation of renewing the loans at maturity.
As such, the ultimate maturity ofassets may be different from the analysis presented above.
To reflect the historical stability of current accounts, theGroup calculates the minimal daily balance of current accounts over the past two years and includes the amount inless than 1 year category in the table above.
The remaining current accounts are included in on demand category.
Bank of Georgia Holdings PLC Annual Report 2012 173 Financial Statements: Notes to consolidated financial statements continued 29.
Maturity Analysis of Financial Assets and Liabilities continued The Groups principal sources of liquidity are as follows: d eposits: borrowings from international credit institutions: inter-bank deposit agreement: debt issues: proceeds from sale of securities: principal repayments on loans: interest income: and fees and commissions income.
These funds continue to provide amajority of the Groups funding and represent a diversified and stable source of funds.
As at 31 December 2012 amounts owed to credit institutions amounted to GEL 1,657,162 2011: GEL 921,172, 2010: GEL 1,138,927 and represented 36% 2011: 24%, 2010: 34% of total liabilities.
In the Boards opinion, liquidity is sufficient to meet the Groups present requirements.
