Segment information The groups operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the BT Group plc Operating Committee, which is the key management committee and represents the chief operating decision maker.
The BT Group plc Operating Committee is chaired by the BT Group plc Group Chief Executive and the other members are the BT Group plc Group Finance Director and the Chief Executives of BT Retail, BT Wholesale, BT Global Services, BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate.
The Chief Executive of Openreach, the BT Group plc Company Secretary and the Group HR Director also normally attend all meetings.
The groups organisational structure reects the different customer groups to which it provides communications products and services via its customer-facing lines of business BT Global Services, BT Retail, BT Wholesale and Openreach.
The customer-facing lines of business are supported by two internal service units BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate.
The customer-facing lines of business are the groups reportable segments and generate substantially all the groups revenue.
The remaining operations of the group are aggregated and included within the Other category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group.
The Other category includes BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate and costs associated with the groups centralised functions including procurement and supply chain, eet and property management.
Provisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the Other segment.
On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the relevant lines of business results offset in the group results by the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the Other segment.
Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the denition of specic items as detailed on page 40.
The costs incurred by BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate are allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in line with the services they provide.
The depreciation and amortisation incurred by BT Operate in relation to the networks and systems it manages and operates on behalf of the customer-facing lines of business are allocated to the lines of business based on their respective utilisation.
Capital expenditure incurred by BT Innovate & Design for specic projects undertaken on behalf of the customer-facing lines of business is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred.
Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular line of business, capital expenditure is allocated based on the proportion of estimated future economic benets.
Capital expenditure incurred by BT Operate is allocated to the customer-facing lines of business in proportion to operating cost recoveries.
BT Innovate & Design and BT Operate and the groups centralised functions are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 Operating Segments for any of the years presented.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is provided below.
Performance is measured based on adjusted EBITDA, dened as EBITDA before specic items, as included in the internal financial reports reviewed by the BT Group plc Operating Committee.
EBITDA is dened as the operating profit or loss before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the lines of business because it approximates the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specic items which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
Specic items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reects how they are reported to the Operating Committee of BT Group plc.
Finance expense and income is not allocated to the reportable segments as this activity is managed by the central treasury function which manages the overall net debt position of the BT Group plc group.

b EBITDA is stated before specific items is a non-GAAP measure provided in addition to the disclosure requirements defined under IFRS.
The rationale for using non-GAAP measures is explained on pages 28 and 29. c Net finance expense includes specific item income of 197m in 2012 2011: 79m expense, 2010: 268m expense.
See note 9. d In 2012 the group moved certain customer accounts between lines of business.
Comparatives for 2011 and 2010 have been restated to be on a consistent basis.
The impact on line of business results in 2011 was to increase revenue of BT Global Services and Openreach by 12m and 45m 2010: 9m and 46m and to decrease revenue of BT Retail and BT Wholesale by 49m and 8m 2010: 46m and 9m.
There is no impact on line of business EBITDA and there is no impact on total group results.

Segment information continued Internal revenue and costs Intra group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price.
Intra group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant lines of business and therefore line of business profitability can be impacted by transfer pricing levels.
The majority of the internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the customer-facing lines of business both directly, and also indirectly, through BT Operate which is included within the Other segment.
Internal revenue arising in BT Retail relates primarily to BT Ireland and BT Enterprises.
Internal revenue arising in BT Wholesale relates to the sale of line cards and access electronic services to Openreach.
