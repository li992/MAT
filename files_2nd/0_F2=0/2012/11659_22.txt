FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 71 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 year ended 31 March 2012 1 NON-GAAP MEASURES The Directors present the following non-GAAP measures as they consider that it gives a better indication of the underlying performance of the business.
iVV LiiiwLiviVi ` `i`w Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m profit before income tax 36.1 26.7 Pension scheme curtailment gain 4.1 Shareholder earnout no longer required 0.6 Reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory 1.7 Gain on disposal of product line 7.0 Acquisition related costs 1.5 Impairment 0.6 Amortisation of acquired intangibles 11.2 4.7 Mark to market gain in respect of derivative financial instruments 1.5 1.1 Adjusted profit before income tax 42.0 26.2 Share of taxation 8.8 5.7 Adjusted profit 33.2 20.5 Further to the acquisitions of Omicron Nanotechnology and Omniprobe announced in June 2011 see Note 5, the Board decided to modify the denition of adjusted profit before tax to exclude the reversal of acquisition related fair value adjustments to inventory to provide an adjusted profit measure that will include results from acquired businesses on a consistent basis over time to assist comparison of performance.
Acquisition related costs comprise professional fees incurred in relation to mergers and acquisitions activity and any consideration which, under IFRS3 revised, falls to be treated as a post acquisition employment expense.
On 20 October 2011 the Group disposed of a product line for a consideration of 8.1 million.
1.0 million of the consideration was deferred for one year.
The product line was part of the Industrial Products segment.
The profit on disposal was 7.0 million.
On 21 March 2012 the Group transferred its ownership of Technologies and Devices Inc TDI to Ostendo, a privately owned company based in California.
The Group has received 650,000 shares of Ostendo common stock plus $0.7 million in cash of which $0.2 million will be paid six months after the closing date.
The Group considers the fair value of the shares to be nil.
The profit on disposal was nil.
During the prior year, the Group recognised other operating income of 0.6 million in relation to a shareholder earnout provided at the time of the acquisition of TDI and which was no longer required.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, they are also measured at fair value.
In respect of instruments used to hedge foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk the Group does not take advantage of the hedge accounting rules provided for in IAS 39 since that standard requires certain stringent criteria to be met in order to hedge account, which, in the particular circumstances of the Group, are considered by the Board not to bring any significant economic benefit.
Accordingly, the Group accounts for these derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
To the extent that instruments are hedges of future transactions, adjusted profit for the year is stated before changes in the valuation of these instruments so that the underlying performance of the Group can more clearly be seen.
In calculating the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in the prior year a one-off recognition of deferred tax assets relating to the Groups UK businesses of 11.3 million was excluded.
At that time the Group announced its intention to exclude the reversal of this deferred tax from the calculation of the share of tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax in the years in which it reverses.
In the current period deferred tax of 4.6 million has reversed and consequently been excluded from the tax attributable to adjusted profit before tax.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 72 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 year ended 31 March 2012 continued 1 NON-GAAP MEASURES continued During the prior year, the Groups dened benefit pension schemes in the UK and US were closed to future accrual.
This gave rise to a curtailment gain under IAS 19 as the majority of active members accrued benets are no longer linked to future salary growth.
During the prior year, the Group recognised an impairment charge of 0.6 million against costs capitalised in relation to the planned site move of the Plasma Technology business in the UK.
This move will now not take place in the form originally planned.
2 SEGMENT INFORMATION The Group has nine operating segments.
These operating segments have been combined into three aggregated operating segments to the extent that they have similar economic characteristics, with relevance to products and services, type and class of customer, methods of sale and distribution and the regulatory environment in which they operate.
Each of these three aggregated operating segments is a reportable segment.
The Groups internal management structure and financial reporting systems differentiate the three aggregated operating segments on the basis of the economic characteristics discussed below.
U The Nanotechnology Tools segment contains a group of businesses supplying similar products, characterised by a high degree of customisation and high unit prices.
These are the Groups highest technology products serving research customers in both the public and private sectors.
U The Industrial Products segment contains a group of businesses supplying high technology products and components manufactured in medium volume for industrial customers.
U The Service segment contains the Groups service business as well as service revenues from other parts of the Group.
Reportable segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those which can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
The operating results of each are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker, which is deemed to be the Board of Directors.
Discrete financial information is available for each segment and used by the Board of Directors for decisions on resource allocation and to assess performance.
No asset information is presented below as this information is not allocated to operating segments in reporting to the Groups Board of Directors.

Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options awarded under the Executive Share Option Scheme are made annually to certain senior executives.
The exercise prices are determined according to the mid-market closing share price on the day before the date of grant.
Options have a life of 10 years and a vesting period of 3 years.
All employee Save As You Earn Scheme Options awarded under the Save As You Earn Scheme have a vesting period of either 3 or 5 years.
Options must be exercised within 6 months of vesting.
There are no performance conditions associated with this scheme.
The final grant under this scheme was made in December 2006 and at the current time the Directors do not intend to grant any further options under this scheme.
Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme SELTIS Options awarded under the Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are made annually to certain senior executives.
The exercise prices are nil.
Options have a life of 7 years and a vesting period of 3 years.
Both the Executive Share Option Scheme and Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme are subject to performance conditions which can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 43 to 52.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 79 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 All employee Share Incentive Plan SIP All UK employees are eligible to participate in the Groups HM Revenue and Customs approved SIP.
Participating employees make a cash contribution to the plan each month.
The Group contributes a further amount equal to 20% of the employees contribution.
Independent trustees then purchase matching shares in the market on behalf of the employees.
The matching shares vest on the completion by the participating employee of a further three years service and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after 5 years service.
Administrative expenses include a charge of 1 million 2011: 0.4 million in respect of the cost of providing share options.
The cost is calculated by estimating the fair value of the option at grant date and spreading that amount over the vesting period.
Fair values are determined using an internal calculation based on a modied Black-Scholes model.
Expected volatility has been based on historical volatility over a period of time of the same length as the expected option life and ending on the grant date.
Half of the ESOS options issued before 2009 and all SELTIS options use Total Shareholder Return TSR as a performance condition.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to internal performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance conditions have been incorporated into the calculation of the fair value as a discount in calculating the fair value.
For options granted in 2012 and 2011, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Senior Executive Long Term Executive Share Incentive Scheme Option Scheme 2012 2011 2012 2011 Fair value at measurement date 4.21 2.98 3.60 2.48 Share price 9.90 7.05 9.90 7.05 Exercise price nil nil 9.90 7.05 Expected volatility 43.1% 47.0% 40.2% 37.6% Expected option life expressed as weighted average life used in the modelling 3 years 3 years 6 years 6 years Expected dividend yield 0.9% 1.2% 0.9% 1.2% Risk free interest rate 0.6% 1.5% 1.3% 2.4% FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 80 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 year ended 31 March 2012 continued 8 SHARE OPTION SCHEMES continued The options existing at the year end were as follows: 2012 2011 Number of Exercise i`i Number of shares price exercisable shares Options subsisting at the year end on unissued ordinary shares Executive Share Option Schemes July 2003 10,000 1.88 01 04 10 15 07 13 15,751 July 2004 7,250 2.18 01 04 10 15 07 14 15,118 July 2005 5,329 2.19 01 04 10 15 07 15 91,012 July 2006 21,105 2.10 01 04 10 15 07 16 30,975 September 2007 37,500 2.32 28 09 10 28 09 17 168,904 December 2007 1.93 18 12 10 18 12 17 2,000 December 2008 72,098 1.35 16 12 11 16 12 18 821,000 December 2009 644,500 2.04 17 12 12 17 12 19 661,500 January 2011 457,000 7.05 07 01 14 07 01 21 463,800 December 2011 498,240 9.90 14 12 14 14 12 21 Save As You Earn December 2006 1,893 1.73 01 02 12 31 07 12 99,752 Total options subsisting on unissued ordinary shares 1,754,915 2,369,812 Percentage of issued share capital 3.1% 4.7% Options subsisting at the year end on existing ordinary shares held in trust Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Scheme December 2008 Nil 16 12 11 18 12 15 260,000 December 2009 160,000 Nil 17 12 12 18 12 16 160,000 January 2011 62,000 Nil 07 01 14 07 01 18 62,000 December 2011 39,800 Nil 14 12 14 14 12 18 Total options subsisting on existing ordinary shares held in trust 261,800 482,000 The number and weighted average exercise prices of those options are as follows: Weighted Number Weighted Number average of average of exercise price options exercise price options 2012 2012 2011 2011 Outstanding at the beginning of the period 2.32 2,851,812 1.55 3,168,371 Granted during the year 9.17 538,040 6.22 525,800 Forfeited during the year 2.15 8,063 1.92 36,398 Exercised during the year 1.27 1,229,338 1.94 667,385 Lapsed during the year 1.69 135,736 1.45 138,576 Outstanding at the year end 4.83 2,016,715 2.32 2,851,812 Exercisable at the year end 1.79 155,175 2.23 323,760 The weighted average share price at the time of exercise of the options was 9.63 2011: 5.45.

A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and a further reduction to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 24% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax asset accordingly.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to individual CGUs as follows: 2011 2012 As restated m m Nanotechnology Tools NanoScience 2.3 2.4 NanoAnalysis 3.9 3.4 Omicron 0.3 Industrial Products Industrial Analysis 3.2 3.5 Magnetic Resonance 2.3 2.3 Austin scientific 1.7 1.6 Service OI Service 0.4 14.1 13.2 See accounting policies for details of restatement of comparative information.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The impairment test operates by determining the recoverable amounts of relevant cash generating units, which are calculated as the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or their value in-use.
The recoverable amount of the Groups goodwill is based on value in use calculations.
For the purpose of impairment testing, Board-approved three year cash ow forecasts, prepared by the management of each CGU are used as a basis for the value in-use calculations together with 2.5% 2011: 5% pa growth for each CGU for the subsequent twenty years.
This growth rate is considered to be at or below long term market trends for the Groups businesses.
Key assumptions The key assumptions are those regarding discount rates, growth rates, expected selling volumes and prices and direct costs during the period.
The growth rates are based on industry growth factors.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The pre-tax weighted average costs of capital used for Nanotechnology Tools, Industrial Products and Service in impairment testing are 11.1% 2011: 11.1%, 10.6% 2011: 10.6% and 10.1% 2011: 10.1% respectively in line with the risk associated with each of the business segments.
Management have estimated these discount rates by reference to past experience and an industry average weighted cost of capital as adjusted for appropriate risk factors reecting current economic circumstances and the risk proles of each CGU.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups estimate of impairments are most sensitive to changes in the discount rate and forecast cash ows.
Sensitivity analysis has been carried out by reference to both of these assumptions.
This demonstrated that an impairment would only be required if there was an increase in the discount rates by 13% 2011: 15% or more or a greater than 10% 2011: 40% reduction in forecast cash ows on the CGU with the lowest level of headroom.
Sensitivity testing on the other CGUs shows an even greater level of headroom.
Based on the above, the Group considers that its impairment calculations are not sensitive to any reasonable change to the key assumptions.

Management have reviewed a detailed forecast for that subsidiary which shows that it is highly probable that future profits will arise and on that basis it is considered appropriate to recognise the deferred tax asset.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 87 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2012 2011 m m Deductible temporary differences 6.5 2.0 Tax losses 9.5 4.5 16.0 6.5 The tax losses and the deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items as it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available in the subsidiaries concerned against which the Group can utilise the brought forward tax losses.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 50.2 million 2011: 48.7 million of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries since the majority of such distributions would not be taxable.
In other cases the Group considers that it is able to control the timing of remittances so that any tax is not expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
On 21 March 2012 the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
This change became substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred tax asset which has been included in the gures above.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by one per cent per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014, but these changes have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are not included in the gures above.
The overall effect of the further reductions from 24% to 22%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 March 2012, would be to further reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 1.0 million.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 89 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups multinational operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, commodity risk and credit risk.
Financial risk management policies are set by the Board of Directors.
These policies are implemented by a central treasury function that has formal procedures to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, including, where appropriate, the use of derivative financial instruments.
Commodity risk is managed locally by the operating businesses.
The Group has clearly dened authority and approval limits.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Such instruments are only used to manage the risks arising from operating or financial assets or liabilities or highly probable future transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to uctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and certain commodity prices.
The Group has adopted hedge accounting for a limited number of related commodity contracts as outlined below.
However, in common with a number of other companies, the Group has decided that the additional costs of meeting the extensive documentation requirements of IAS 39 to apply hedge accounting to derivative financial instruments used for hedging exposure to foreign currency and interest rate volatility cannot be justied.
Accordingly the Group does not use hedge accounting for such derivatives.
i}ViV Foreign currency risk arises both where sale or purchase transactions are undertaken in currencies other than the respective functional currencies of Group companies transactional exposures and where the results of overseas companies are consolidated into the Groups reporting currency of sterling translational exposures.
The Group has operations around the world which record their results in a variety of different local functional currencies.
In countries where the Group does not have operations, it invariably has some customers or suppliers that transact in a foreign currency.
The Group is therefore exposed to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates between a number of different currencies but the Groups primary exposures relate to the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
To reduce uncertainty the Group maintains a rolling hedge equivalent to 80% of the exposure expected to arise over the following 12 months.
The hedge comprises a mixture of xed forward contracts and option based products.
The remaining 20% is sold on the spot market as it arises.
The fair value of outstanding currency contracts recognised as a liability as at 31 March 2012 amount to 1.0 million 2011: 0.5 million and those recognised as an asset amount to 2.4 million 2011: 0.7 million.
Movements in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Income immediately.
However, in order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison of the Groups performance year on year the element of these movements that relate to hedges in respect of future sales are treated as adjusting item in the calculation of adjusted earnings see note 1.
The Groups translational exposures to foreign currency risks can relate both to the Consolidated Statement of Income and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is not to hedge the translational exposure that arises on consolidation of the Consolidated Statements of Income of overseas subsidiaries.
ii i Interest rate risk comprises both the interest rate price risk that results from borrowing at xed rates of interest and also the interest cash ow risk that results from borrowing at variable rates.
At this time, the majority of the Groups borrowings attract oating rates of interest and therefore the Groups principal interest rate risk is a cash ow risk.
In May 2008 the Group entered into an interest rate swap in order to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.
Under the terms of the swap, the Group paid xed interest of 4.1% on the notional amount of 14.8 million and received three months Sterling LIBOR.
The swap was cancelled on 1 April 2011 for a settlement value of 0.6 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as at 31 March 2012 is estimated as a liability of 0.1 million 2011: 0.6 million.
These amounts are based on market estimates of equivalent instruments at the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
These interest rate swaps are not designated as cash ow hedges, for hedge accounting purposes, and consequently they are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
No charge credit was made to the Consolidated Statement of Income in the period 2011: credit of 0.3 million.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 90 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 year ended 31 March 2012 continued 17 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued ` Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing this risk is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by maintaining adequate committed lines of funding from high quality lenders.
The facilities committed to the Group as at 31 March 2012 are set out in note 20. i` Credit risk arises because a counterparty may fail to perform its obligations.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets such as cash balances, derivative financial instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are net of appropriate allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade receivables are subject to credit limits, and control and approval procedures in the operating companies.
Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables.
Credit risk associated with cash balances and derivative financial instruments is managed by transacting with financial institutions with high quality credit ratings.
Accordingly the Groups associated credit risk is limited.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the Group Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
iVi` The carrying amount of financial assets represent the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2012 was 93.9 million 2011: 73.9 million.
2012 2011 m m Trade receivables 51.9 42.3 Other receivables 4.5 6.4 Cash and cash equivalents 35.1 24.5 Forward exchange contracts 2.4 0.7 93.9 73.9 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables is discussed in note 16.
Other receivables include 1.0 million 2011: 0.9 million in respect of VAT and similar taxes which are not past due.
` The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly in respect of copper used as a major component in the Groups US operations.
It manages this exposure using derivative commodity hedging instruments.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had outstanding commodity hedge contracts with a fair value liability of 0.1 million 2011: 0.3 million asset that were designated and effective as cash ow hedges of committed and highly probable forecast transactions.
Fair value movements of these contracts have been deferred in equity until the hedged transaction takes place.
These contracts all mature within one year of the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position date.
A 0.1 million loss net of tax 2011: 0.2 million gain has been deferred in equity as at 31 March 2012 in respect of these contracts.
A gain of 0.3 million 2011: 0.3 million gain has been recycled to current assets inventory in respect of contracts designated as cash ow hedges that have matured during the year to 31 March 2012.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 91 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 Capital management The Board considers Capital to comprise share capital, reserves and the net cash or net debt position of the company.
The company was in a net cash position at the year end.
The Boards long term objective is to have an efficient capital structure by maintaining a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
This is monitored by reference to the ratio of net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and the board has set itself internal limits, which are well inside any covenants the Group has with lenders.
The Group maintains the right to purchase its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases would depend on market prices.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specic transaction basis by the Board.
The Board carefully considers dividend payments and the company moved from a xed dividend policy to a progressive one in the year ended March 2011.
In doing this the Board will look to increase dividends as adjusted earnings per share increase although there will not be a direct correlation.
The Board do not have a policy to pay a xed dividend yield or to maintain a xed rate of dividend cover, but assess both of these metrics together with dividends paid by peers when assessing what dividend to recommend.
The Group outlined its new medium term targets on the 14 June 2011 in its 14 Cubed Plan.
Part of this plan calls for bolt-on acquisitions.
In line with the objective of maintaining a balance between borrowings and equity, the Group decided to seek to repay the debt drawn down to finance the first two acquisitions of the 14 Cubed Plan through an equity issue, improving the net debt to EBITDA ratio, thereby allowing it to finance any future bolt-on acquisitions from its balance sheet and existing committed facility without recourse to further equity issues.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company.
As well as various share option plans full details of which are given in note 8, from April 2008 all UK employees have been offered the opportunity to take part in a Share Incentive Plan SIP.
Under this plan, employees are able to invest up to 1,500 each tax year in shares in the Company.
The Company awards one additional free share a matching share for every five shares bought by each employee.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Sensitivity analysis The Group has estimated the impact of the change to the fair value of its financial instruments and the translation of currency profits and assets on the Consolidated Statement of Income and on equity for the following: U one percentage point increase in interest rates U ten percentage point weakening in the value of sterling against all currencies U ten percentage point strengthening in the value of sterling against all currencies U five percentage point increase in the cost of copper U five percentage point decrease in the cost of copper The outputs from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the impact of market risk assuming that the specified changes occur net of any hedging in place at the year end.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these estimates due to commercial actions taken to mitigate any potential losses from such rate movements, to the interaction of more than one sensitivity occurring and to further developments in global financial markets.
