In 2011 Telerob Holdings GmbH Mission Equipment, Trivec-Avant Corporation Antenna Systems and Corp Ten International Inc. Tactical Communications and Surveillance were acquired.
Reclassifications in 2011 include the transfer of assets held for sale.
Customer relationships represents customer lists, customer contracts and the related customer relationships recognised on acquisition.
Technology based assets represent trade secrets and processes, patented and unpatented technology and know-how recognised on acquisition, together with purchased technology assets.
Other intangible assets represent purchased and acquired patents, licences and trademarks, software rights and licences and the order backlog of acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.
Order backlog is derecognised when it has been fully amortised.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 81 Notes to the Group financial statements continued Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce, and is the only indefinite life intangible asset held by the Group.
It is allocated to the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and is measured as the residual excess of the total consideration paid to acquire a business over the fair value of the recognisable net assets acquired.
The Group reviews goodwill for potential impairment of each cash generating unit CGU annually, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
As a result of the site integrations and other Excellence in Delivery activity CGUs are typically considered to be SBUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations unless specific conditions at a CGU dictate otherwise.
No such specific conditions existed at 31 December 2012 except for businesses held for sale which were assessed for impairment using expected net proceeds of divestment.
Following detailed review, no impairment provisions have been recognised in the period.
In 2011 7.0m of goodwill was written down in respect of a business held for sale.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and operating cash projections during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the Groups time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured.
The Group annually prepares cash flow forecasts for the following five years at CGU level and these are approved by management.
These forecasts take into account the current and expected economic environment including factors such as the softening of the US defence market in the near term.
The growth rate assumed after this five year period is based on long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The long-term projections used are in the range 2.5% to 3.0%.
The growth rates assume that demand for the Groups products in the USA and in the UK remains broadly in line with the underlying economic environment in the long term future.
Taking into account the expectation of future market conditions management believe that the evolution of selling prices and direct costs will reflect past practices.
The pre-tax rates used to discount the forecast cash flows are within the range 8.8% to 10.9% 2011: 9.0% to 10.8%, having considered the country and currency risks in the principal territories in which the Group operates.
If the goodwill allocated to a CGU represents more than 10% of the Groups total goodwill carrying value then the CGU is considered to be individually significant.
These CGUs are as follows: Goodwill carrying value Headroom Pre-tax m m discount rate Defence Electronics previously Sensor Systems 219 167 9.7% SATCOM 200 263 9.1% Antenna Systems 90 887 9.5% Tactical Communications and Surveillance 107 125 9.3% Life Support 84 455 9.7% Sensitivity analysis has been performed on these CGUs and no impairment losses would arise if the discount rate increased by 20%, if the growth rate was zero or if cash flows reduced by 20%.
The Directors have not identified any other likely changes in other significant assumptions that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

Property rental income earned by the Group from its investment properties amounted to 1.8m 2011: 1.7m, which is net of all direct costs associated with the leasing of the property except depreciation.
The buildings are leased to commercial users on operating leases with terms of between 5 and 25 years, commencing between 1998 and 2010.
A forward starting lease has been agreed for one property extending that lease term to 2022.
The fair value of the Groups investment properties has been assessed to be 18.0m 2011: 18.4m.
These values are based on Directors estimates using current market data.
Investments in joint ventures and associates The Group has the following interests in joint ventures within the Aviation Services segment: 45% of the voting share capital in Aviation Dfense Service SA, a company incorporated in France.
50% of the voting share capital in FB Heliservices Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales.
50% of the voting share capital in FBS Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales.
50% of the voting share capital in FB Leasing Limited, a company incorporated in England and Wales.
Notwithstanding the fact that the holding is 45%, the governance structure for Aviation Dfense Service SA is such that the Group has joint control with its partner and therefore the investment is treated as a joint venture.
Within the Cobham Aerospace and Security segment the Group has a 50% interest in Northrop Grumman Cobham Intercoms LLC, a company incorporated in the USA.
The Group also holds 30% of the voting share capital in Philtech Co. Ltd, a company operating and incorporated in South Korea.

This allowance is reviewed by management on a regular basis and further amounts are provided or released as considered necessary.
The amounts are generally determined based on factors which include ageing and known demand.
Subsequent events may give rise to these estimates being revised and, consequently, to reversal of amounts previously provided.
No significant inventory was written off directly to the income statement 2011: nil.
Inventory will be realised within the normal operating cycle of the businesses.

All financial instruments measured at fair value in the table above are classified as level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy, as they have been determined using significant inputs which are based on observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments, fixed rate loans and finance leases have been determined by the use of valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, based on assumptions that are supported by observable market prices or rates, whilst the fair value of bank overdrafts and floating rate loans are based on market values.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables and trade payables and other liabilities are assumed to approximate to their fair values due to their short term nature.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the fixed rate senior notes, included in borrowings at 220.9m 2011: 313.0m is 272.2m 2011: 370.4m.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of all other financial assets and liabilities recorded in these financial statements is equal to, or approximates to, their fair value.
The fair value of the Groups net financial liabilities at 31 December 2012 is 377.7m 2011: 263.7m.
The Groups investment in the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft companies as described in note 15d is classified as available for sale.
The Group does not hold any financial assets which would be classified as held to maturity.
The total interest income and expense for financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit or loss is as shown in note 4.

Due to uncertainties surrounding the timing of settlement of these items, they have been disclosed as current liabilities.
Provisions for warranty claims and contract losses are generally expected to be crystallised within one year.
Aircraft maintenance provisions relate to significant periodic maintenance costs as well as return conditions for leased aircraft.
These conditions may relate to the number of operational hours to be available before a major maintenance check, the physical configuration of the aircraft or direct costs to be incurred by the lessee in the physical return of the aircraft to the lessor.
Whilst there is uncertainty over the future level of flying hours, aircraft maintenance provisions are anticipated to crystallised in the next nine years.
Other provisions include amounts provided in respect of announced business restructuring and legal claims and are expected to be settled within one year.

Other deferred tax assets and liabilities shown above include balances arising from temporary differences in relation to provisions, share-based payments, goodwill and derivative financial instruments.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes are analysed as follows: m 2012 2011 Deferred tax liabilities fall due as follows: Within one year 7.2 5.0 After one year 37.0 10.5 44.2 15.5 Deferred tax assets are recoverable as follows: Within one year 2.8 13.9 After one year 7.0 4.4 9.8 18.3 Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 92 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances, deferred tax balances are as follows: Accelerated tax Retirement benefit Intangible m depreciation obligations assets Other Total Deferred tax assets 0.8 17.0 42.2 60.0 Deferred tax liabilities 19.2 65.4 9.8 90.4 At 31 December 2012 18.4 17.0 65.4 32.4 34.4 Deferred tax assets 0.2 17.8 23.1 41.1 Deferred tax liabilities 11.0 24.1 3.2 38.3 At 31 December 2011 10.8 17.8 24.1 19.9 2.8 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused capital losses of 65.7m 2011: 64.9m potentially available for offset against future capital profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 431.1m 2011: 511.2m.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013, with further reductions proposed to reduce the rate to 21% by 1 April 2014.
The Groups share of the tax on temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures and associates included within the Groups share of assets and liabilities as shown in note 12 was 1.3m 2011: 3.9m.

There is no material ineffectiveness in cash flow hedges to be reported through the income statement.
Foreign exchange and inflation derivatives are not accounted for using hedge accounting and movements in fair values are recorded in the income statement as part of operating profit.
The movement in the fair value of currency swaps which offset movements in currency balances are offset against exchange movements in those balances in the income statement.
Full details of the Groups financial instrument accounting policies and risk management strategies, objectives and policies are set out in the statement of accounting policies and in note 24.
In 2011, following the divestment of the Analytic Solutions business and repayment of a portion of floating rate debt, a number of interest rate swaps were cancelled.
These interest rate swaps had previously been designated as cash flow hedges and the related hedge reserve was reclassified to the income statement.
A number of interest rate swaps were also cancelled in 2009.
As these were originally designated as cash flow hedges, the related hedge reserve is being amortised over the life of the original forecast issuance the hedge item.
In 2012, 2.8m 2011: 3.6m was reclassified from the hedge reserve to the income statement and reflected in finance costs.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group manages a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The total expense recognised in the income statement of 21.1m 2011: 24.0m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
0.6m 2011: 0.8m was outstanding in respect of defined contribution schemes but not due for payment at 31 December 2012.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of funded defined benefit schemes, the most significant being the Cobham Pension Plan CPP.
The assets of all of these schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
All defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members since 2003.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 94 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information Actuarial valuations of the present value of the defined benefit obligations for the CPP are carried out on a triennial basis by qualified independent actuaries: the most recent valuation was as at 1 April 2012.
Actuarial valuations of other schemes have been carried out at regular intervals as required by the applicable country regulations.
The actuarial valuations were updated by qualified independent actuaries for accounting purposes to 31 December 2012.
As part of the Groups risk management strategy for defined benefit obligations, certain liabilities relating to past service of pensioner and deferred members of defined benefit schemes were subject to a buy-in arrangement on 14 December 2011.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the schemes impacted transferred assets to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides annuity payments equal to the liabilities covered by the arrangement as they fall due.
This eliminated the Groups exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities.
The insurance contract asset is measured at a value equal to the related liabilities.
Contributions of 19.6m were payable into the schemes in 2011 representing the difference between the cost of this asset and the net obligations transferred.
The Group continues to review its exposure to risks associated with pension obligations, including the potential purchase of further insurance policies.
The purchase of insurance policies would have the effect of increasing the net liability recognised under IAS 19.
During the year the Group merged two of the smaller defined benefit pension plans into the Cobham Pension Plan in order to improve the efficiency of administration of the schemes and to realise additional benefits of scale.
There were no significant contributions outstanding at the end of 2012 or 2011 for the defined benefit schemes.
Following the disposal of the Engineering Consultancy Group business in 2011, curtailment gains of 1.4m were recognised in the income statement in that year.
The amount recognised in 2011 in the income statement also included 12.5m relating to past service following changes to the rate of certain UK pension increases.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: 2012 2011 UK Schemes USA Scheme UK Schemes USA Scheme Rate of increase in salary costs 3.47% 3.47% 3.62% 3.62% Rate of increase in pensions in payment unless overridden by specific scheme rules 2.97% 2.97% 3.12% 3.12% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.17% 2.97% 2.12% 3.12% Discount rate 4.40% 4.40% 4.85% 4.85% Inflation assumption 2.97% 2.97% 3.12% 3.12% Expected return on scheme assets 4.84% 4.40% 5.12% 5.46% The mortality assumptions used for the CPP are based upon actual recent mortality experience of members within the scheme and also allow for future mortality improvements.
The mortality tables used to estimate life expectancy are known as SAPS CMI 09.
In practical terms this is demonstrated in the table below: Year of birth Year age 65 Further life expectancy Male 1947 2012 22.6 years Female 1947 2012 24.7 years Male 1980 2045 25.8 years Female 1980 2045 27.9 years At 31 December 2012 it has been assumed that members will commute on average 20% 2011: 20% of their pension for cash at retirement.
This implies a full take-up of the permitted 25% 2011: 25% commutation by approximately 80% 2011: 80% of eligible members on retirement.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Notes to the Group financial statements continued A summary of the movements in the net liability and the amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income are as follows: 2012 2011 Defined Defined Scheme benefit Scheme benefit m assets obligations Total assets obligations Total Net liability at start of year 528.7 599.9 71.2 510.8 592.8 82.0 Amounts recognised in operating profit Current service cost included in administrative expenses 4.3 4.3 4.2 4.2 Past service cost credit included in administrative expenses 0.3 0.3 12.5 12.5 Gain on curtailment included in profit on divestment 1.4 1.4 Amounts credited charged to other finance income costs Expected return on pension scheme assets 26.6 26.6 32.7 32.7 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 28.6 28.6 31.5 31.5 Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 12.8 12.8 40.3 40.3 Experience gains arising on scheme liabilities 12.8 12.8 1.8 1.8 Changes in assumptions underlying present value of scheme liabilities 41.3 41.3 2.1 2.1 Amounts included in cash flow statement Employer contributions 20.0 20.0 20.9 20.9 Employer contributions related to buy-in arrangement 19.6 19.6 Member contributions 2.8 2.8 3.2 3.2 NI rebates 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 Benefits paid 18.4 18.4 18.9 18.9 Other changes Exchange differences 0.7 0.8 0.1 0.2 0.2 Net liability at end of year 572.4 645.8 73.4 528.7 599.9 71.2 Total employer contributions exceeded current service cost and past service cost or credit by 15.4m 2011: 48.8m.
The present value of funded obligations relating to the US scheme is US$34.5m 2011: US$30.1m and the fair value of scheme assets relating to the US scheme is US$21.3m 2011: US$18.4m.
The sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in certain key assumptions is provided below: Increasing the discount rate by 0.1% would decrease scheme liabilities by 10.7m.
Increasing the inflation rate by 0.1% would increase scheme liabilities by 6.6m.
If each scheme member was expected to live for an additional year then scheme liabilities would increase by 15.5m.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since transition to IFRS is 182.5m loss 2011: 166.8m loss.
Of the actuarial losses recognised in the year for changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities, approximately 48m relates to the decrease in the discount rate mitigated by approximately 7m relating to the inflation assumptions.
The actual return on scheme assets was 39.4m 2011: loss 7.6m.
The Group expects to contribute 20.3m to its defined benefit pension schemes in 2013.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 96 Business overview Corporate governance Financial statements Other information The fair value of major categories of scheme assets, and as a percentage of total scheme assets, are as follows: 2012 2011 m % m % Equity instruments 217.5 38.0% 176.2 33.3% Debt instruments 262.0 45.7% 259.6 49.1% Property 42.7 7.5% 43.3 8.2% Insurance contracts 40.1 7.0% 36.9 7.0% Other assets 10.1 1.8% 12.7 2.4% 572.4 100.0% 528.7 100.0% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant indices published by, for example, the London Stock Exchange.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.
The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets used by, the Group.
The history of the scheme for the current and previous four periods is as follows: m 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 Present value of defined benefit obligations 645.8 599.9 592.8 561.3 458.4 Fair value of scheme assets 572.4 528.7 510.8 446.1 407.2 Net liability 73.4 71.2 82.0 115.2 51.2 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities 12.8 1.8 1.3 1.8 5.5 Experience adjustments on scheme assets 12.8 40.3 24.1 13.8 49.2 Other retirement benefit schemes A number of the Groups subsidiaries based in France contribute to a retirement indemnity scheme.
The liabilities of the scheme were valued by an independent actuary as at 31 December 2012 at EUR4.3m and are recorded in these financial statements at 3.5m 2011: 3.2m.
These liabilities are included in other liabilities in note 19.
Some retirement obligations relating to a subsidiary based in Germany have gross obligations of EUR2.2m 2011: EUR2.2m.
These obligations are covered by an insurance policy and therefore there is no net liability.
The actuarial loss for these schemes in the year to 31 December 2012, recognised in OCI, was 0.5m 2011: nil.
Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other instruments, including interest rate swaps.
Other derivative financial instruments may be used from time to time to hedge other exposures such as inflation risks.
The financial risk management policies agreed by the Board have not changed during the year and are summarised below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments or use complex derivative financial instruments.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments including those in Australia and other European countries.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
All currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by Cobham plc management.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 97 Notes to the Group financial statements continued The carrying amounts of the Groups total foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities, translated into sterling at the relevant year-end exchange rates, are as follows: 2012 2011 Monetary Monetary Monetary Monetary m assets liabilities assets liabilities US dollars 214.2 624.3 235.5 647.3 Euros 87.8 49.7 100.9 49.4 Australian dollars 65.9 72.8 107.8 98.8 Danish kroner 14.0 92.6 1.3 3.6 Foreign currency borrowings are used to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the Groups overseas net assets.
The Group typically borrows US dollars to fund acquisitions in the USA and uses intercompany debt to create a natural economic hedge.
The following borrowings included in monetary liabilities in the table above and foreign exchange contracts match exposures arising from currency denominated net assets: m 2012 2011 US dollar borrowings 484.2 460.1 US dollar foreign exchange contracts 93.8 193.0 On consolidation, the net assets of overseas subsidiaries which include monetary assets and liabilities shown in the tables above are translated at closing exchange rates and exchange differences arising are accounted for in other comprehensive income and in the translation reserve note 26.
During 2012, the Group has Danish kroner borrowings and commitments under foreign exchange contracts which are used to fund the Danish kroner investment in Thrane & Thrane and net investment hedging has been applied.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk in the income statement where individual subsidiaries hold non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and when an operating unit makes sales and purchases in currencies other than its own functional currency.
The Group undertakes a formal process to actively manage and mitigate this exposure through a combination of matching non-functional currency revenues and costs, matching non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities and through the use of forward contracts.
The sterling US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as the Group is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which non-US based subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities, and the proportion of the Group based in the USA.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts by its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts for net sales of US dollars outstanding as at 31 December: US$m amount Average US$: exchange rate 2012 2011 2012 2011 Expiring within one year 138.7 138.5 1.59 1.59 Expiring within one to two years 76.0 63.8 1.61 1.59 Expiring after two years 17.9 46.2 1.58 1.61 232.6 248.5 1.60 1.59 The latest expiry date of forward foreign currency contracts for sales of US dollars is December 2015.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currencies.
The sensitivities below represent managements assessment of the possible changes in foreign exchange rates, based on experience over the previous five years.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the assumption that the change is effective throughout the financial year.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant and includes the effect of derivative financial instruments.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity.

In order to provide comparable information, sensitivity has also been assessed based on a 10% weakening in sterling against the respective foreign currency, as follows: 2012 2011 m Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity Sensitivity Profit or loss Total equity US dollars 10% 12.2 12.2 10% 12.7 12.7 Euros 10% 7.7 7.7 10% 10.5 10.5 Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short-term borrowings, principally in US dollars, Australian dollars and Danish kroner at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group continually monitors its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions and to use interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk.
Borrowings are held under both fixed and floating rates as follows: m 2012 2011 Fixed rates Senior notes 220.9 313.0 Floating rates Bank loans and overdrafts 306.3 162.4 Senior notes 95.3 99.8 Loan notes 0.4 1.5 Other borrowings and finance leases 1.2 1.4 403.2 265.1 Total borrowings 624.1 578.1 All floating rate borrowings have regular repricing dates.
Interest rate swaps which mitigate the exposure arising on floating rate debt are as follows, all are designated as cash flow hedges: Period of swap 2012 2011 Hedged item Fixed rate from to Currency value m Currency value m US dollar loans 3.22% June 2010 June 2013 US$65.0m 40.0 US$65.0m 41.8 3.49% March 2008 March 2013 US$80.0m 49.2 US$80.0m 51.5 3.61% August 2008 August 2013 US$150.0m 92.3 US$150.0m 96.5 Australian dollar loans 6.30% May 2006 January 2020 AUS$66.2m 42.3 AUS$74.4m 49.1 6.40% January 2007 January 2020 AUS$12.5m 8.0 AUS$14.3m 9.4 231.8 248.3 The Group does not currently hold any interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedging instruments.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit and as such also give rise to interest rate exposure.
However, as a result of the Groups policy to manage interest rate risk, there was no material sensitivity to changes in interest rates at the year end.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a change of 1.0% in interest rates throughout the year, with all other variables, including foreign currency exchange rates, held constant.
A positive number indicates an increase in profit after taxation and total equity where interest rates rise.
A fall in interest rates would have the equal but opposite effect on the basis that all other variables remain constant.

For short-term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the US a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the year has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with their lenders.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
The table below summarises the remaining contractual maturity for the Groups financial liabilities.
The amounts shown are the contractual undiscounted cash flows which include interest, analysed by contractual maturity.
The difference between the contractual cash flows and the carrying amount of these liabilities reflects the effects of interest not included in the carrying amount and discounting applied in assessing fair value.

As shown in note 18, 89.3m was available to the Group at 31 December 2012 2011: 199.6m.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Group has a conservative policy towards the credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments with balances currently spread across a range of reputable financial institutions, such counterparties are banks with satisfactory credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The levels of credit risk are monitored through the Groups ongoing risk management processes, which includes a regular review of the banks credit ratings.
Risk in this area is limited further by setting a maximum level for deposits with any one counterparty.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
Customers are typically large global companies or government agencies with long-term trading relationships.
The Group also has in place procedures that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales are made.
Existing customer accounts are monitored on an ongoing basis and appropriate action is taken where necessary to minimise any credit risk.
The Directors therefore believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of normal provision for impaired receivables.
Group management monitor the ageing of receivables which are more than one month overdue and debtor days on a regular basis.
At 31 December 2012, 6.4% 2011: 6.5% of gross trade receivables were overdue by one month or more.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2012 is the fair value of each class of receivable as disclosed in note 15. Letters of credit are the only collateral held as security against trade receivables.
These are obtained in a limited number of cases in accordance with good business practice and secure around 3.0m of receivables.
Bank term balances totalling 7.5m 2011: 12.5m have been pledged against the residual value of leased assets as detailed in note 16.
Finance leases totalling 0.9m 2011: 0.9m are secured against the items of property, plant and equipment that the leases are financing.
Group assets have not been pledged in respect of the Groups primary borrowing facilities or other financial liabilities.
Cobham plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 101 Notes to the Group financial statements continued In the UK and the USA, the Group has master netting arrangements in respect of bank balances.
In the normal course of business these bank accounts are settled on a net basis within each currency and as such are presented net in the financial statements.
In the event of an automatic enforcement event the bank balances are automatically set off against each other to achieve a net position.
Inflation risk The Groups exposure to inflation is considered to be a general business risk which is mitigated through normal commercial activity.
A swap contract was entered into during 2011 to manage the inherent inflation risk in one specific operational contract.
Capital risk management Group policy is to maintain a strong capital base, defined as total equity, excluding non-controlling interests, totalling 1,053.8m at 31 December 2012 2011: 1,018.6m, so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
Within this overall policy, the Group seeks to maintain an optimum capital structure by a mixture of debt and retained earnings.
Funding needs are reviewed periodically and also each time a significant acquisition or business divestment is made.
A number of factors are considered which include the net debt EBITDA ratio, future funding needs usually potential acquisitions and proposed dividend levels.
Group banking arrangements are also considered: these include financial covenants which are based on adjusted IFRS results.
This policy has been reviewed by the Board on a regular basis during the year and, given the current economic climate, continues to be considered appropriate.
Typically the Group will hold deposits in sterling and borrowings in foreign currencies to fund overseas operations.
During the year, additional funding has been secured from commercial lenders and through private placements: new borrowings include amounts in euro, US dollars and Danish kroner.
There have been no breaches of the terms of the Group banking arrangements which have been met with significant headroom and there have been no defaults during the current or prior year.
During 2011, as part of the Groups overall capital management policy as described above, 150.0m of capital was returned to shareholders through a share buy-back programme using proceeds from business divestments.

On a show of hands every member holding Ordinary Shares who is present in person or by a duly authorised representative has one vote and on a poll every member who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every 1 in nominal value of the shares of which the member is the holder.
No new shares have been issued during the current or prior year.
This includes 75,951,724 shares purchased during 2011 under a share buy-back plan at a total cost of 151.0m and 11,747,681 2011: 4,027,891 shares held in the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust.
At 31 December 2012, the market value of treasury shares was 193.6m 2011: 146.7m, including shares with a market value of 25.9m 2011: 7.4m held by the Cobham Employee Benefit Trust.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, treasury shares were used to satisfy awards and options under the Groups PSP, BCP, ESOS and ShareSave schemes.
The net cost of treasury shares after receipts from option exercises is deducted from retained earnings and total equity.
In addition to the Ordinary Shares described above, 19,700 6% second cumulative Preference Shares have been issued which represent 0.1% of total issued share capital.
These are non-redeemable and are classified as borrowings with a value of 19,700.
The shareholders of the 6% second cumulative Preference Shares are entitled to receive a fixed cumulative preference dividend at the rate of 6% per annum in priority to the payment of dividends on the Ordinary Shares.
In addition, on a return of assets on the liquidation or otherwise of the Company, the assets available for distribution are to be applied first in repaying to the holders of the 6% second cumulative Preference Shares the amounts paid up on their shares.
On a show of hands, every member holding 6% second cumulative Preference Shares who is present in person has one vote and on a poll, every member has one vote for every 1 in nominal amount of the shares of which the member is the holder.

The Cobham Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
The Cobham Bonus Co-investment Plan BCP.
The PSP scheme allows for annual grants of conditional shares which mainly vest 50% based on the Groups three year Total Shareholder Return relative to that of a sector comparator group and 50% based on the growth of the Groups underlying EPS over the same period.
This scheme includes buy-out awards granted during the year to the Groups Chief Executive Officer.
The BCP scheme allows participants to defer up to 50% of their net earned annual performance bonus into Cobham shares in return for an opportunity to earn up to a 2:1 matching award of shares against the gross bonus invested, based on three year Economic Profit growth targets.
Under the ESOS, options are granted at a price not less than the market value of the Groups Ordinary Shares on, or shortly before, the date the options are granted.
Exercise is conditional upon the Groups underlying EPS growth over a three year period.
The scheme also includes a time-only section which is offered to participants based in the USA.
This allows for options to be granted with 25% vesting on each annual anniversary conditional only on continued employment within the Group.
The Cobham Savings Related Share Option Scheme ShareSave is an HMRC approved savings related share option plan which is open to all UK employees.
Employees contribute to a monthly savings plan and after an agreed period of at least three years, employees have the option to use these savings plus interest to purchase the Groups shares at 80% of the market price on the date of grant.

The rules of the BCP scheme allow for a matched award based on the gross amount of the bonus, dependent upon satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The exact amount of the entitlement will be ascertained upon vesting of the awards.
For the award vesting in 2012, the operation of the gross up mechanism resulted in an additional 62,023 2011: 348,267 matching shares being awarded to the holders of the 93,025 2011: 541,452 invested shares exercised in the year.
Under the ESOS and ShareSave schemes, exercises were made at various times throughout the year.
The weighted average share price in that period was 2.165 2011: 2.024.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The expected employee cancellation rate is based on an assessment of historic rates of voluntary cancellations of contracts by employees.
Most participants of the PSP scheme receive the benefit of dividend payments and therefore dividend yields are not taken into consideration in the valuation model.
Cash settled share-based payment schemes Share appreciation rights SARs were issued in 2006 and 2007 to a number of senior executives which required the Group to pay the intrinsic value of the award to the employee at the date of exercise.
These awards vested in 2009 and the majority expired in November 2011, with a small number expiring in February 2012.

Business combinations During the year the issued share capital of Thrane & Thrane A S was acquired through market and private purchases and a public offer.
On 10 April, the Group held 25.6% of the issued share capital and has included its share of post-tax results of the business in the income statement alongside the Groups share of post-tax results of joint ventures.
Control was achieved on 8 June 2012 when, through a combination of shares purchased and unconditional and irrevocable agreements with shareholders, Cobham controlled 96.9% of the issued share capital, and the business has been consolidated as a subsidiary from that date.
Subsequently, during 2012, the remaining share capital has been acquired.
In accordance with IFRS 3 the revaluation gains on previously held equity interests in Thrane & Thrane that arise on gaining control of the company have been recognised in the income statement.
This business is now part of the Aerospace and Security division.
The fair value of Thrane & Thrane can be reconciled as follows: m Cash consideration including compulsory purchase obligations 279.6 Share of profit during the period the investment was held as an associated undertaking 0.4 Revaluation gains arising on equity interests on transfer of control 1.0 Fair value at date control achieved 281.0 A summary of the fair values of the net assets acquired are as follows: m Non-current assets 147.3 Current assets 65.4 Current liabilities 41.8 Non-current liabilities 40.4 Net assets acquired 130.5 Goodwill 150.5 Total value of business acquired 281.0 All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess of the total cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
Goodwill represents the premium paid in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised, such as the value of the workforce.
Goodwill is not anticipated to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquired receivables are included in current assets in the table above at their fair values and relate to trade and other receivables which are considered to be recoverable in full.
The results since the date of acquisition are as follows: m Third party revenue 70.3 Operating profit 8.8 Loss after tax 8.6 The loss after tax since the date of acquisition includes the impacts of amortisation of the intangible assets which are recognised as a result of the business combination and are included within the results of the acquired business for management reporting purposes.
If this acquisition had taken effect on 1 January 2012, it is estimated that Group total revenues would have been 1,808.5m and profit after tax 181.3m.
This information is not necessarily indicative of the results had the operations been acquired at the start of the period, nor of future results of the combined operations.

Contingent liabilities and commitments At 31 December 2012, the Company and the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank and contractual performance guarantees and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business.
Where it is expected that a material liability will arise in respect of these matters, appropriate provision is made within the Group consolidated financial statements.
As the conditions of these guarantees are currently being met, no obligating event is foreseeable and therefore no provision has been made at the year end.
A number of performance guarantees and letters of credit have been provided in connection with the FSTA project.
No provision was made at 31 December 2012 or 2011 in connection with these guarantees.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to various legal proceedings and claims and management do not anticipate that the outcome of these, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
The nature of much of the contracting work done by the Group means that there are reasonably frequent contractual issues, variations and renegotiations that arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Group has previously identified one, more significant, contractual breach dating back some years.
The contract was in respect of goods provided into a geographic market which represents only a small amount of revenue for the Group.
Although there have been no developments during the year, the circumstances surrounding this remain under review and the outcome still cannot be estimated.
Resolution may take some time.
No further information is disclosed as it could be prejudicial.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment of 17.2m 2011: 3.9m.
The Company has also committed, in connection with the FSTA project, to invest 6.1m in equity share capital and to provide additional funding of 18.2m in the form of redeemable loan notes in March 2013.
