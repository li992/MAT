These estimates take into account the level and quality of the investees earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the investee operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date that they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

Deferred tax continued Deferred tax has been accounted for at the substantively enacted corporation tax rate of 24% 2011: 26%.
Further reductions to the main rate have been proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014.
These further reductions in the tax rate had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not reflected in these financial statements.
As at 31 March 2012 the Group has tax losses carried forward of 11.8 million.
It is not probable that these will be utilised and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences arising from the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries of 17.3 million, because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Additionally, any tax consequences of distribution of those profits are expected to be insignificant.
Share based payments All share based payment transactions are equity settled.
The total charge to the income statement for the year was 13.1 million 2011: 8.5 million and this was credited to the reserve in equity for share based payments.

Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The Groups treasury policies seek to manage the following risks.
i Interest rate risk The Groups assets include both fixed and floating rate loans and non interest bearing equity investments.
The Groups operations are financed with a combination of shareholders funds, bank borrowings, private placement notes, a public bond, and fixed and floating rate notes.
The Group manages its exposure to market interest rate movements by matching, to the extent possible, the interest profiles of assets and liabilities and by using derivative instruments.
As a result, the Group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The sensitivity of assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is disclosed in d, page 117. ii Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to the translation of net assets, currency transactions and the translation of net assets, and profit and loss accounts of foreign subsidiaries.
The Groups most significant exposures are to the euro and the US dollar.
The Group manages its exposure to market currency risk by matching assets with debt to the extent possible and through the use of derivative instruments.
The Group regards its interest in overseas subsidiaries as long term investments.
Consequently it does not normally hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the financial statements of these businesses.
The Group is exposed to currency risk arising on the translation of fund management fee income receipts, which are primarily denominated in euro.
Fund management fee income is hedged to provide more certainty over the value of future cash inflows.
US dollar denominated management fee income is not hedged as foreign exchange risk arising from this income is not expected to be material to the Groups results.
The financial assets and liabilities by currency and the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities to foreign exchange rates are shown in d, page 117.
This is before the effect of derivative instruments.
iii Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining headroom on its financing facilities, particularly the bank facilities.
The table below shows the liquidity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, based on contractual repayment dates of principal and interest payments.
Future interest and principal cash flows have been calculated based on exchange rates and floating rate interest rates as at 31 March 2012.
It is assumed that borrowings under the Groups revolving credit facility remains at the level as at 31 March 2012 until contractual maturity.

iv Refinancing risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the Groups assets the Group seeks to ensure that the maturity of its debt instruments is matched to the expected maturity of its assets.
This has been achieved by the ongoing private placement programme with notes maturing between two and 10 years, short term borrowings under bank facilities, a public bond and by issuing floating and fixed rate notes.
v Credit risk The Groups policy is to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
The Group believes that all financial assets that are neither past due or impaired will be recovered in full.
Details on impairments are included in note 17, which sets out the factors the Group considers when determining if a financial asset is impaired.
Additional information on the concentrations of credit risk is provided by industry and country on page 46.
ICG minimises its surplus operational cash balance by regularly forecasting cash flow requirements and managing its level of debt.
Operational cash is deposited in a pool of current accounts with one of our key relationship banks.

Financial assets and liabilities continued The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair values: Loans and receivables Interest bearing loans with a determinable repayment date are recognised in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
AFS financial assets, and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Equity investments and warrants fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
The valuation techniques applied follow the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines and include some assumptions which are not supportable by observable market prices or rates.
The majority of the portfolio of unquoted shares and warrants is valued using an earnings based technique.
Earnings multiples are applied to the maintainable earnings of the private company being valued to determine the enterprise value.
From this, the value attributable to ICG is calculated based on ICGs holding in the company after making deductions for higher ranking instruments in the capital structure.
ICGs policy is to use reporting earnings based on the latest management accounts available from the Company, which is adjusted for non-recurring items.
For each company being valued, the earnings multiple is derived from a set of comparable listed companies or relevant market transaction multiples that have been approved by the Investment Committee.
A premium or discount is applied to the earnings multiple to adjust for points of difference relating to risk and earnings growth prospects between the comparable company set and the private company being valued.
Across the portfolio being valued, the discount applied is generally in a range of between 5% to 30% and exceptionally as high as 50%.
The adjusted multiple is the key valuation input which could change fair values significantly if a reasonably possible alternative assumption was made.
If this input to the valuation models for a selection of the largest financial assets was changed by 10% while all the other variables were held constant, the impact would be as set out in the table below.
The following table shows the sensitivity of fair values grouped in level 3 to reasonably possible alternative assumptions as at 31 March 2012.

Of the change in fair value in the period 1.0 million 2011: 1.1 million is due to changes in credit risk of the asset.
27.8 million 2011: 38.0 million relates to an acquisition.
Other derivatives The fair value of the derivatives used for hedging purposes is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity, as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
The Group has loans and receivables with a conversion option embedded.
Given the low probability of conversion by the Group, the value attributed to these embedded derivatives is nil.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recognised in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.

Financial assets and liabilities continued c Fair value measurements recognised in the statement of financial position The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
