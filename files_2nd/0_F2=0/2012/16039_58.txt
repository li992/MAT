6. Business and geographical segments As required by IFRS 8 the operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
On 1 January 2012, the Group was reorganised into four divisions, General Merchanting, Specialist Merchanting, Consumer and Plumbing and Heating.
Prior year figures have been restated to reflect the new segments.
All four divisions sell building materials to a wide range of customers, none of which are dominant, and operate almost exclusively in the United Kingdom and consequently no geographical information is presented.
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of certain central costs, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
Unallocated segment assets and liabilities comprise financial instruments, current and deferred taxation, cash and borrowings and pension scheme assets and liabilities.
During 2012 and 2011 there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in any of the reportable segments.
