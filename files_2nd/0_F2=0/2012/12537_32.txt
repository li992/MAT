The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with IAS 19 - Employee Benefits.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2012.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2012, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the group at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 24 July 2012.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per cent of the aggregate of members pensionable salaries.
