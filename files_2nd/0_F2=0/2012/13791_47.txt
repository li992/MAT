The aim is to provide remuneration packages which are sufciently competitive to attract, retain and motivate individuals of the quality required to achieve the Groups objectives and thereby enhance shareholder value.
The Committee takes account of the level of remuneration paid to Executive Directors and senior managers of comparable public companies and best practice standards.

62 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 Unaudited information continued Pay and conditions across the Group Consideration has also been given to general pay and employment conditions across the Group.
The Group operates in a number of different countries and has many employees who perform a diverse range of jobs.
Therefore, although it is difficult to take into account pay and employment conditions across the Group specically when setting the remuneration of the Executive Directors: U iii]V`}i iV] i `LiviiVii i i UVi}iv Vii `i`} Liviv Vi i i`L Vii Vi Ui vvii i Ui vviiiV`V iVi i 1 i`V V`}} ` `vi ` vi `i Vi Ui vvi }ivLiiw`ii`}iiiV V`}i]yiLiLiiw] ` i i `i V i Vi ` U VV` Vii Liiv i i }iiiviii and shareholders, the Company offers the following employee share plans, further details of which are set out below and in note 28 to the Financial Statements: qi iv Vii ]i iVi iV `i }ii ` qi ivii`- i i`Li i`i i ii ii}]i to all other employees.

In 2009, the Remuneration Committee decided to amend its policy of granting Awards to the whole workforce, and limited participation in the PSP to senior executives.
Accordingly, as approved by the shareholders at the ii ii}] i`ivii`LVii i Vi`i - vVi iii but not Directors, recognising that the PSP continuing to apply to all employees was not appropriate.
The PSP remains the sole long term incentive arrangement for all Executive Directors.
The PSP is intended to facilitate the retention and incentivisation of senior executives within the Group, including Directors, and to align their interests with those of shareholders by enabling them to receive shares in Salamander, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and continued employment.
The Remuneration Committee believes that the PSP provides an appropriate degree of exibility in the way in which a share based incentive arrangement can be operated by the Group, while giving due consideration to best and market practice.
63 Corporate governance Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 Remuneration report continued Unaudited information continued Performance Share Plan continued The PSP was first adopted when the Company listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.
When it was adopted, the PSP was structured so as to provide a competitive long term incentive compared to other companies of a similar size Salamander initially listed within the FTSE Small Cap, and with the features conforming to prevailing market practice and best practice at that time.
In 2010, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the operation of the PSP in the context of Salamander as a FTSE 250 constituent and concluded that, in order to remain competitive relative to the market, changes to its operation for 2010 and future years were required, namely, an increase to the individual limit in the PSP to 200% of salary p. a.
In circumstances where the Committee considers it appropriate to do so, including the recruitment or retention of an employee or Executive Director, the Committee may exceed the normal 200% limit at its discretion.
The PSP is operated as follows: U ` i `i iVi iVv Vi } limit except where the Remuneration Committee deems it necessary to grant a higher award in specic circumstances.
