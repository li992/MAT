As part of this agreement, on 29 June 2012, the Group and Pratt & Whitney restructured their participation in IAE, which produces the V2500 engine for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft.
Rolls-Royce sold its equity, programme share and related goodwill in IAE to Pratt & Whitney for US$1.5 billion.
As Rolls-Royce continues to be responsible for the manufacture of high-pressure compressors, fan blades as well as the provision of engine support and final assembly of 50 per cent of V2500 engines, the transaction was not considered to give rise to a discontinued operation.
2 These notes are the subject of interest rate swap agreements under which the Group has undertaken to pay floating rates of interest which form a fair value hedge.
3 O bligations under finance leases are secured by related leased assets.
