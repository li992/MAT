BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 257 9.7 Supplementary oil and gas information unaudited continued Results of operations from oil and gas producing activities The following information is similar to the disclosures in note 2 to the financial statements Segment reporting but differs in several respects as to the level of detail and geographic information.
Amounts shown in the following table exclude financial income, financial expenses, and general corporate overheads.
Income taxes were determined by applying the applicable statutory rates to pre-tax income with adjustments for permanent differences and tax credits.
Certain allocations of tax provisions among geographic areas were necessary and are based on managements assessment of the principal factors giving rise to the tax obligation.
Revenues include sales to affiliates but amounts are not significant.

258 | BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 7 8 9 10 11 Directors Report Legal proceedings Financial Statements Glossary Shareholder information Standardised measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves Standardised measure The purpose of this disclosure is to provide data with respect to the estimated future net cash flows from future production of proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas.
The Standardised measure is based on the Groups estimated proved reserves as presented in section 2.13.1 Petroleum Reserves and this data should be read in conjunction with that disclosure, which is hereby incorporated by reference into this section.
The Standardised measure is prepared on a basis which presumes that year-end economic and operating conditions will continue over the periods in which year-end proved reserves would be produced.
The effects of future inflation, future changes in exchange rates, expected future changes in technology, taxes, operating practices and any regulatory changes have not been included.
The Standardised measure is prepared by projecting the estimated future annual production of proved reserves owned at period end and pricing that future production to derive future cash inflows.
Estimates of future cash flows for 2012, 2011 and 2010 are computed using the average  price during the 12-month period.
Future price increases for all periods presented are considered only to the extent that they are provided by fixed and determinable contractual arrangements in effect at year-end and are not dependent upon future inflation or exchange rate changes.
Future cash inflows for all periods presented are then reduced by future costs of producing and developing the year-end proved reserves based on costs in effect at year-end without regard to future inflation or changes in technology or operating practices.
Future development costs include the costs of drilling and equipping development wells and construction of platforms and production facilities to gain access to proved reserves owned at year-end.
They also include future costs, net of residual salvage value, associated with the abandonment of wells, dismantling of production platforms and rehabilitation of drilling sites.
Future cash inflows are further reduced by future income taxes based on tax rates in effect at year-end and after considering the future deductions and credits applicable to proved properties owned at year-end.
The resultant annual future net cash flows after deductions of operating costs including resource rent taxes, development costs and income taxes are discounted at 10 per cent per annum to derive the Standardised measure.
There are many important variables, assumptions and imprecisions inherent in developing the Standardised measure, the most important of which are the level of proved reserves and the rate of production thereof.
The Standardised measure is not an estimate of the fair market value of the BHP Billiton Groups oil and gas reserves.
An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated future changes in prices, costs and exchange rates, anticipated future changes in secondary tax and income tax rates and alternative discount factors representing the time value of money and adjustments for risks inherent in producing oil and gas.

Completion refers to the installation of permanent equipment for production of oil or gas, or, in the case of a dry well, to reporting to the appropriate authority that the well has been abandoned.
An exploratory well is a well drilled to find oil or gas in a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir.
A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
A productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well.
A dry well hole is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.
Oil and gas properties, wells, operations, and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive crude oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage as at 30 June 2012.
A gross well or acre is one in which a working interest is owned, while a net well or acre exists when the sum of fractional working interests owned in gross wells or acres equals one.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production.
Developed acreage is comprised of leased acres that are within an area by or assignable to a productive well.
Undeveloped acreage is comprised of leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil and gas, regardless of whether such acres contain proved reserves.
The number of productive crude oil and natural gas wells in which we held an interest at 30 June 2012 was as follows: Crude Oil Wells Natural Gas Wells Total Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Australia 282 139 104 37 386 176 United States 114 52 5,877 1,792 5,991 1,844 Other 71 30 49 14 120 44 Total 467 221 6,030 1,843 6,497 2,064 Of the productive crude oil and natural gas wells, 24 Net: 10 had multiple completions.
