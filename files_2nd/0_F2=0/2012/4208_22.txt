During the year, as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% that was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and that will be effective from 1 April 2013, the relevant deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
Deferred tax expected to reverse in the year to 31 December 2013 and beyond has been measured using the 23% rate.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in all cases where such assets arise, as it is probable the assets will be recovered.
Deferred tax is only recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries to the extent that remittance is expected in the foreseeable future.
If all earnings were remitted, an additional 2.4m 2011: 1.8m of tax would be payable.
All movements on deferred tax balances have been recognised in income with the exception of the charges shown in note 5 b, which have been recognised directly in equity.

Discontinued operations In November 2012, the Group sold its Italian manufacturing assets based at Cremona, along with the associated business, to GreenOleo SpA for a consideration of 3.9m, generating a loss on disposal of 11.5m, net of a deferred tax credit of 1.7m.
In January 2012, the loan note of 16.1m arising from the sale of the Groups Chicago site was repaid early by HIG Capital, the purchasers of the site.
This early settlement gave rise to an exceptional profit of 1.6m.
The environmental provision relating to sites previously occupied by discontinued businesses has been increased by 2.6m in recognition of further information received in 2012 relating to potential future liabilities.
The Group closed its Bromborough site in 2009.
During 2012 the final deferred consideration of 0.8m 2011: 1.0m was received in relation to the disposal of the site.
Other exceptional income of 0.3m was received in respect of other dormant sites.
In 2011, the Group completed the sale of its 60% holding in its Korean joint venture, Croda Woobang, to the Korean joint venture partners for a consideration of 2.2m, generating a profit on disposal of 0.6m.

Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the UK and cover the vast majority of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and are funded.
In the US, the Group operates a funded dened benefit scheme as well as providing unfunded post-retirement medical benets for employees.
In other countries, benets are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided on several bases.

81 BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION UK pension schemes The financial assumptions used to assess the UK schemes liabilities were: 2012 2011 Projected unit Projected unit Valuation method Discount rate 4.5% 4.8% Ination rate - RPI 3.1% 3.3% Rate of increase in salaries 4.1% 4.3% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0% 3.1% Expected return on scheme assets 7.3% 7.3% 2012 2011 The assets in the schemes comprised: % of fair value % of fair value Equities 59.1 49.9 Bonds 14.3 19.5 Property 8.3 8.2 Other 18.3 22.4 100.0 100.0 For funded schemes throughout the Group, the expected return on scheme assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes.
The expected return for each class reects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets as suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
The discount rate applied to the Groups UK scheme is now based on Towers Watsons Rate:link model that more closely reects interest rates applicable to the prole of the schemes liabilities than the previously used iBoxx index.
Had the previous model been used this year end, the Groups total retirement benefit liability would have been around 8m higher.

As a result of the reduced opening pension deficit for 2013, the effect in 2013 is expected to be somewhat smaller.

Intangible assets Goodwill is tested at each year end for impairment with reference to the relevant cash generating units CGU recoverable amount compared to the units carrying value including goodwill.
The relevant CGU when testing the Uniqema goodwill of 193.4m is the Groups Consumer Care operating segment.
The recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations using pre-tax discounted cash ow projections based on the Groups current year results and a future growth rate of 3% 2011: 3%.
The cash ows have been discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which for these purposes has been calculated to be approximately 6.8% after tax 2011: 7.8%.
The key assumptions underpinning the forecast employed in the value in use calculation reect a prudent view of past experience and are that market share will not change signicantly and that gross and operating margins will remain broadly constant.
The directors believe there are no reasonably probable significant changes in assumptions which would give rise to an impairment charge in the year.

Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash ows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.
Book Fair Book Fair Value Value Value Value 2012 2012 2011 2011 m m m m Cash deposits 53.8 53.8 44.3 44.3 Other investments 0.9 0.9 15.4 15.4 177.8 177.8 2010 Club facility due 2015 182.4 182.4 $100m xed rate 10 year bond 61.9 71.9 64.5 74.1 Other bank borrowings 21.2 21.2 27.9 27.9 Obligations under finance leases 0.6 0.6 0.6 0.6 For financial instruments with a remaining life of greater than one year, fair values are based on cash ows discounted at prevailing interest rates.
Accordingly, the fair value of cash deposits and short term borrowings approximates to the book value due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The same applies to trade and other receivables and payables excluded from the above analysis.
As noted in the accounting policies note on page 90, the Groups management of its currency risk includes the use of forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of the contracts in place at 31 December 2012 was zero 2011: 0.3 m. Financial instruments Effective 1 January 2009, the Group adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following hierarchy: - Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2 - Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.
All of the Groups financial instruments are classied as level 3.

Borrowings, other financial liabilities and other financial assets continued Borrowing facilities As at 31 December 2012, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 204.2m 2011: 201.5m, all expiring in more than two years.
In addition the Group had other undrawn facilities of 67.4m 2011: 65.5m available.
Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest-rate risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is approved by the Board and implemented and reviewed by the Risk Management Committee.
Detailed financial risk management is then delegated to the Group Finance department which has a specic policy manual that sets out guidelines to manage financial risk.
Regular reports are received from all operating companies to enable prompt identication of financial risks so that appropriate action may be taken.
In the management and denition of capital the Group includes ordinary and preference share capital and net debt.
Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to currency risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US Dollar and the Euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Entities in the Group use forward contracts and foreign currency bank balances to manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities.
The Groups risk management policy is to hedge transactional risk up to three months forward.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not specically hedged but is reduced primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies where it is efficient to do so.
For 2012, had the Groups basket of reporting currencies been 10% weaker stronger than the actual rates experienced, post-tax profit for the year would have been 11.6m 2011: 11.0m lower higher than reported, primarily as a result of the translation of the profits of the Groups overseas entities, and equity would have been 17.4m 2011: 20.0m lower higher.
Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining at least 50% of its gross borrowings at oating interest rates and at 31 December 2012 over 75% of Group borrowings were at oating rates.
During 2010 the Group issued a ten year xed rate $100m loan note.
The loan note is repayable in 2020 and carries a xed rate of 5.94%.
As at 31 December 2012, aside from the $100m loan note, all Group debt and cash was exposed to repricing within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups xed rate debt was at a weighted average rate of 5.94% 2011: 5.94%.
The Groups oating rate liabilities are predominantly based on LIBOR and its overseas equivalents.
Based on the above, had interest rates moved by 10 basis points in the territories where the Group has substantial borrowings, post tax profits would have moved by 0.2m 2011: 0.2m due to increased interest expense on the Groups oating rate borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities designed to ensure the Group has sufficient funds available for operations and planned investments.
The Group also has a share buyback programme which is managed to ensure the efficiency of the Groups funding structure.
On a regular basis, management monitors forecasts of the Groups cash ows against both internal targets and those targets imposed by external lenders.
The Group has substantial committed, unused facilities and the directors are confident this situation will remain the case for the foreseeable future.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
91 BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce overall cost of capital.
In order to maintain this optimal structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or dispose of assets to reduce net debt.
Given the Groups strong balance sheet and sustained trading growth, the Group announced a new dividend policy in 2011 of paying a dividend of between 40% and 50% of sustainable earnings.
Further details can be found in the Chairmans statement on pages 2 and 3.
Underlying growth coupled to Return on Invested Capital ROIC is the key perceived driver of shareholder value within the Group.
The acquisition of Uniqema in 2006 reduced the ROIC, but also reduced Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC since the deal was predominantly nanced through debt.
The Groups ROIC has grown steadily since the acquisition and now stands at 23.8% against a WACC of 6.8%, thus hitting the Groups target of maintaining ROIC at a higher level than the WACC.
In addition, the Group employs two widely used ratios to measure our ability to service our debt.
Both net debt EBITDA and EBITDA interest cover were well ahead of target in 2012.
The Group was in compliance with its covenant requirements throughout the year.
Additional information on performance against key performance indicators can be found in the Financial review on page 15.
ROIC Group profit after tax before exceptional items average invested capital.
WACC weighted average cost of servicing the Groups net debt and its equity share capital Average invested capital average net assets of the Group as at the start and end of the year adjusted to add back net debt, retirement benefit liabilities, tax balances and provisions.

The environmental provision relates to soil and potential ground water contamination on a number of sites, both currently in use and previously occupied, in Europe and the Americas.
Restructuring provisions relate to the remaining employee and property costs associated with the final elements of the Uniqema integration plan.
In relation to the environmental provision, the directors consider that the balance will be utilised within 20 years.
Provisions for remediation costs are made when there is a present obligation, it is probable that expenditures for remediation work will be required and the cost can be estimated within a reasonable range of possible outcomes.
The costs are based on currently available facts and prior experience.
Environmental liabilities are recorded at the estimated amount at which the liability could be settled at the balance sheet date.
Remediation of environmental damage typically takes a long time to complete due to the substantial amount of planning and regulatory approvals normally required before remediation activities can begin.
In addition, increases in or releases of environmental provisions may be necessary whenever new developments occur or additional information becomes available.
Consequently, environmental provisions can change signicantly.
With regard to the restructuring provision, the directors view is that the balance will be fully utilised by 2014.
Based on information currently available and on the detailed plans established for the restructuring of the Group, this level of provision is considered appropriate by the directors.
The Group has considered the impact of discounting on its provisions and has concluded that, as a consequence of the significant utilisation expected in a relatively short timescale, the impact is immaterial.
The level of environmental provision is based on managements best estimate of the most likely outcome for each individual exposure.
Management has also assessed the worst possible case for each exposure and is confident that the Groups financial position would not be signicantly affected if each case were to require this worst case settlement.

Employees then enter into a savings contract over three to five years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a 6 month period following completion of the savings contract.

IRB is an Italian technology company specialising in plant cell culture biotechnology.
The focus of the business is the development and commercialisation of products originating from plant cell culture biotechnology for use in personal care applications.

Under Croda ownership the business will retain its independence but the products will be sold under the Sederma brand.
In combination with the existing technical expertise of Sederma, the focus will be to continue exploiting the technology in the personal care market, using the Groups global selling network.
