The Investment Manager attempts to monitor and manage these risks on an ongoing basis.
While the Investment Manager generally seeks to hedge certain portfolio risks, the Investment Manager is not required and may not attempt to hedge all market or other risks in the portfolio, and it may decide to only partially hedge certain risks.
Market Risk and Price Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in the value of investments.
Categories of market risk include, but are not limited to interest rate and foreign exchange risk.
Interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve, the volatility of interest rates and credit spreads.
Price risk is the risk that the price of the security will fall.
The exposure to price risk is managed by the Investment Manager by diversifying the portfolio and economically using forward contracts.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to Sterling investments and share issue proceeds.
The Company makes use of hedging techniques, as part of its risk management strategy, including but not limited to the use of forward exchange contracts to mitigate its exposure to this risk.
These instruments involve market risk, credit risk, or both kinds of risks.
Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from movement in currency and securities values and interest rates.
