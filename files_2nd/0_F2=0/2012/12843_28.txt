They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP, under the historical cost convention.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, an entity profit and loss account is not included as part of the published consolidated financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc.
The profit for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Parent Company is 31.7 million 2011: 21.6 million.
No cash flow statement has been included as the cash flows of the Company are included in the consolidated financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc which are publicly available.
The consolidated financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Amounts paid to the Companys auditors in respect of the statutory audit were 6,000 2011: 6,000.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the date of the Company balance sheet.
Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Taxation and deferred taxation Current tax including UK corporation tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding contract to dispose of these assets, nor on unremitted earnings where there is no binding commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are not capitalised: they are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
The Company has not entered into any transactions involving derivative instruments.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
Current asset investments Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Own shares held by ESOT Transactions of the Company-sponsored ESOT are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reflected in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised once paid.

Financial instruments utilised by the Company during the years ended 31 May 2012 and 31 May 2011, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current asset investments In accordance with FRS 25 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Companys balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings and current asset investments approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the Company do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
