V. the Group adjusted outstanding claims and related reinsurers share of outstanding claims to fair value on acquisition.
The reduction to the original carrying value of 39.1 million and 6.4 million to outstanding claims and reinsurers share of outstanding claims respectively is being recognised through a charge to the income statement over the period the claims are settled.
This net charge is 3.9 million in 2012 2011: 4.0 million.
The fair value was based on the present value of the expected cash flows with consideration for the uncertainty inherent in both the timing of, and the ultimate amount of, future payments for losses and receipts of amounts recoverable from reinsurers.
The nominal amounts were discounted to their present value using an applicable risk-free discount rate.
Further information on the calculation of outstanding claims and the risks associated with them is provided in the risk disclosures in note 3.
