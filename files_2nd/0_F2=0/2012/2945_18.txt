The Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT waived part of its entitlement to the 2011 final dividend and all of its entitlement to the 2012 interim dividend paid during the year amounting to 2.6 million.
This 2.6 million has been used to satisfy UK SIP awards which vest immediately.
These awards give rise to acharge under International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based payment of 2.6 million.
The Group is not committed to make any awards under the SIP in excess of those funded by the EPT.
Where the award of shares under the SIP is fully funded by the waiver of dividends by the EPT, there is no material net impact on the net debt or net assets of the Group over the contractual life of the plan compared to if the EPT had not waived its dividends.
As this charge has arisen from the decision by the EPT to waive its entitlement to dividends and is outside of the control of the normal operating parameters of the Group, the charge is classified as a non-recurring operating item.
Further details on the SIP are given in the Remuneration report on page 61.
Integration and rationalisation costs of 40.0 million in 2011 primarily relates to redundancy and property exit costs arising from a review of theGroups requirements following the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services including relatively modest costs associated with focusing the Canadian construction services business on the growing Public Private Partnership market in the region.

In 2011, the Group disposed of a small jointly controlled entity in the Netherlands.
The disposal generated a cash consideration of 6.9 million before disposal costs of 0.7 million and a non-operating profit of 3.8 million.
There is no income tax associated with this profit.
Acquisition costs in 2012 of 0.9 million relate to adviser costs incurred in relation to the Bouchier Group acquisition contract and due diligence procedures.

Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant amounts of goodwill: 2012 2011 m m Construction services excluding the Middle East segment UK construction 233.0 233.0 Canada construction 11.0 11.4 244.0 244.4 Support services segment Business services 1,134.8 1,134.8 Infrastructure services 52.1 52.1 Canada services 20.8 1,207.7 1,186.9 Total Goodwill 1,451.7 1,431.3 83 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 11.
Intangible assets continued Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash generating units.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnership projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable CGUs within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
The CGUs have been identified within the reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which aresubject to independent management.
The acquisition of the Bouchier Group was a small acquisition which enables the Group to enhance its support services capabilities in Canada.
The entire provisional goodwill arising on this acquisition has been allocated to the Canada services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use in 2012 was determined on a similar basis to 2011.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2012 in the light of the continuing challenging economic environment.
The impact of this on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has five CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the pre-tax discount rate management have derived a Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle East was 11.7 per cent 2011: 12.0 per cent and for the CGUs in the Support services segment was 9.9 per cent 2011: 10.0 per cent.
The cash flows used to determine the value in use calculations are based upon the latest three year forecasts approved by management which are based upon secured and probable orders and the Groups overall strategic direction.
The cash flows are extrapolated from year four, with a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent.
This growth rate does not exceed the long-term industry average and reflects the synergies from recent acquisitions.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to a minimum of 19.2 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to a minimum of 13.0 per cent for Support services before an impairment was triggered in any CGU.
As at 31 December 2012, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management have concluded that the recoverable value of the Groups cash generating units exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 35.1 million 2011: 34.6 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 119 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition ofAlfred McAlpine in 2008 will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 29.4 million arising on the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services will be completed by 2014.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2012 2011 m m Tax losses 35.9 60.5 The tax losses do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the lack of certainty concerning the quantum and timing of future years taxable profits of the companies concerned.
Included in the tax value of carry forward losses recognised are losses acquired for which no value was recognised at the point of acquisition.
Since acquisition, the recognition of value relating to the losses is attributable to the fact that the company now foresees taxable profits arising in the relevant legal entities over a period in line with its tax loss recognition policy.
The assets further recognised in 2012 are 0.3m and 5.4m in relation to the Carillion Energy Services and Mowlem acquisitions respectively.
These assets existed but were not recognised at the time of these acquisitions.
Following the introduction of the foreign profits exemption with effect from 1 July 2009, no deferred tax liability is required to be recognised in relation to taxable temporary differences arising on unremitted earnings from overseas businesses.

A reduction in the ratefrom 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the companys future current tax charge and reduce the companys deferred tax asset accordingly.

Reserves continued Merger reserve The merger reserve initially arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011, whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
The 31.4 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem, Alfred McAlpine and Carillion Energy Services acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2012 2011 m m At 1 January 0.2 0.1 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 1.4 4.3 Acquisition of own shares 1.2 4.4 At 31 December 0.2 At 31 December 2012, the ESOP held 250 2011: 74,290 of the Companys shares and had a market value of 793 2011: 0.2 million.
During the year the Company acquired 433,105 of its own shares for 1.2 million to meet the plans commitments.
The ESOP has electedto waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2012 the total number of shares held by the QUEST amounted to 129,979 2011: 129,979 and had a market value of 0.4 million 2011: 0.4 million.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
During the year the Company also acquired 696,601 of its own shares for 1.8 million to facilitate an award under the Carillion Energy Services Share Incentive Plan SIP for UK partners as disclosed in note 4.
In addition cash payments totalling 0.8 million were made to good leavers who were entitled to receive shares under the terms of the SIP.
Awards under the SIP vest immediately in relation to UK partners and therefore the cost of these shares of 2.6 million has been charged directly to the retained earnings reserve.
The 1.8 million payment to acquire Carillionplc shares is included within acquisition of own shares in the cash flow statement and the 0.8 million paid to good leavers isincludedwithin payment to employees in settlement of share options in the cash flow statement.
Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of the share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration report on pages 53 to 61.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, senior employees and Executive Directors receive a proportion of their bonus in shares, which vest a year after the award inrespect of senior employees and three years after the award in respect of Executive Directors.

Shares awarded under the SIP to UK partners vest immediately and therefore the share-based payment charge is recognised in full at the date of award.
Shares awarded under the SIP to international partners have a three year vesting period and the share-based payment charge is recognised over the vesting period.
The expected life of the options is taken to be the full vesting period, as historical exercise patterns have shown this to be appropriate.
The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

The Group considers such guarantees and counter indemnities to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The Group treats guarantees and counter indemnities of this nature as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the terms of the arrangement.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
The Group, in the normal course of its activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded asunlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
There are no liabilities of jointly controlled entities for which the Group is contingently liable.

In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily toforeign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies are tominimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
93 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 27.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet fromthe impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, asa minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies, or where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
In November 2012, the Group secured US$280 million of private placement finance at fixed interest rates from a number of United States based investors in order to provide greater flexibility in relation to the maturity profile of Group borrowing.
The Group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility in relation to the associated capital and interest payments.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the Operating and financial review on page 34.
Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2012 2011 m m United States of America Dollar 188.6 16.3 Canadian Dollar 90.7 94.8 United Arab Emirates Dirham 7.5 7.9 Other 3.0 1.9 289.8 120.9 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 289.8 million 2011: 120.9 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency net asset amounts to 83.7 million 2011: 86.4 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 1.5 million 2011: 0.1 million gain on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America Dollar 0.7 0.8 Canadian Dollar 0.2 3.1 0.3 3.2 Euro 0.1 1.0 0.1 1.1 United Arab Emirates Dirham 0.7 3.6 0.8 4.0 Oman Rials 0.4 2.1 0.5 2.3 Danish Kroner 1.1 1.2 Other 0.2 1.0 0.2 1.1 Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
In addition, foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
During 2012, the Group secured additional finance of 210.0 million from a private placement at fixed rates of interest, as disclosed in note 20.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates was to ensure that a proportion of the Groups borrowing was not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge byapproximately 0.2 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.4 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 3.9 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowings an increase of0.1 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated loan, a bilateral facility, private placement financing and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level orwithin predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the 31 December by geographic region was: 2012 2011 m m United Kingdom 179.8 171.2 Middle East 9.6 34.2 Canada 45.8 75.6 Rest of the World 0.9 1.7 236.1 282.7 95 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 27.

Trade receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review ofindividual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.

Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.

In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range up until February 2040.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within jointly controlled entities inthe statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2012 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 99.2 million 2011: 161.3 million of which 23.8 million 2011: 34.0 million and the related deferred tax asset of 5.5 million 2011: 8.5 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

Financial instruments continued Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-current asset investments and derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of non-current asset investments is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The movement in the fair value of non-current asset investments derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: m At 1 January 2012 49.9 Additions 3.0 Fair value of equity interests retained on partial disposal 3.0 Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 4.9 At 31 December 2012 60.8 The fair value of non-current asset investments is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 5.5 million.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets.

Finance lease obligations are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital toshareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Where the Group makes significant acquisitions, these are financed with a combination of debt and equity in order to maintain a balanced capital structure.
In order to have greater flexibility over the maturity profile ofdebt, the Group has secured around 310 million of private placement financing during the course of 2011 and 2012 with maturity dates between 2017 and 2024.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings per sharegrowth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or process duringthe years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions in 2012 On 11 December 2012, the Group acquired a 49% equity shareholding in the Bouchier Group for a cash consideration of 23.8 million.
Theconsideration is payable in instalments, with 4.9 million paid in December 2012 which is included in the cash flow statement within acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired.
The remaining instalments of 9.5 million payable in early 2013 and 9.4 million payable in January 2014 have been included as deferred consideration payable within liabilities in the balance sheet.
The Group has options to acquire the remaining 51% of the equity over the next 10 years for a consideration capped at 43.1 million.
The Bouchier Group is being consolidated as asubsidiary on the basis of the terms of these options and the powers granted as a shareholder which enable Carillion management to exert control.
A provisional assessment has been made of the fair value of the net assets acquired of 3.0 million.
On the basis of this assessment the provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition amounts to 20.8 million.
The Bouchier Group, which is based in Alberta, Canada, provides a range of services, including road maintenance, infrastructure services and facilities management.
The acquisition compliments the Groups existing support services activities in Canada and provides access to substantial new growth markets.
Due to the immaterial nature of this acquisition, the full disclosures required under International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations have not been presented.
Acquisitions in 2011 On 14 February 2011, Carillion plc purchased 41,580,041 Eaga plc shares in the market, representing 16.5 per cent of the issued share capital, ata cash cost of 49.9 million.
On 21 April 2011, the Group obtained control of the remaining issued share capital of Eaga plc, which when combined with the cost of acquiring shares on 14 February 2011, resulted in a total consideration of 298.4 million.
The total consideration was satisfied by the issue of 30.6 million Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at the close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 384.36 pence and 181.2 million in cash.
On acquisition, Eaga plc was rebranded Carillion Energy Services CES.
CES is a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions.
The Group believes that the acquisition represents a strategic move that will provide the Group with a strong position in a number of new and attractive markets and enhance its ability to provide existing and new customers with integrated support services solutions.
The Group believes it can achieve synergies in the enlarged Group of 25 million per annum by the end of 2013 with one-off costs of delivering those savings in the regionof 40 million.

Thegoodwill recognised represents the benefits of cost savings arising from the elimination of duplication and the potential for significant cross-selling opportunities within the enlarged Group, together with providing the enlarged Group with access to energy efficiency markets thathave substantial growth prospects.
The principal fair value adjustment relates to 61.1 million of goodwill on the CES balance sheet at the date of acquisition which is reclassified atthe same value as goodwill on Carillions balance sheet under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
A contingent liability of 14.2 million has been recognised for the future distributions to employees from the Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT which crystallises a National Insurance cost to the Company.
A full provision has been recognised at the current employer National Insurance rate of 13.8 per cent on the total assets currently held by the EPT which are available for distribution.
The timing and quantum of future distributions are determined by the EPT.
The 4.9 million accounting policy adjustment results from applying Carillions policy in respect of expensing rather than capitalising certain costs associated with the securing of new contracts.
The 21.8 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts, net of attributable deferred tax.

Acquisitions and disposals continued In addition to the adjustments noted above, following a dialogue between CES and Carillions management teams during the course of the duediligence period granted to Carillion by CES, the 27.7 million carrying amount of net assets acquired at 21 April 2012 incorporates a numberof adjustments made to CESs initial carrying amounts and followed a review of all balance sheet categories.
These adjustments include areduction in the valuation of inventories of 14.0 million, following a review of inventory held and its recoverability taking into account changes in contracts, technological advancement and product sales in the pre-acquisition period: a 24.3 million reduction in the carrying value of trade and other receivables, largely the result of the reassessment of aged debt, aged accrued income, supplier rebates and contract receivables in lightof contract performance and certain contractual changes during the pre-acquisition period: an adjustment to trade and other payables of46.9million to reflect contract related liabilities and other identified obligations: and other adjustments of 0.3 million.
Total consideration for the acquisition comprises the following: m Cash paid to acquire shares in the market 49.9 Cash paid to acquire control 131.3 Total cash paid 181.2 Loss on re-measurement to fair value of shares acquired in the market 0.5 Element of consideration relating to cash 180.7 Equity shares issued 117.7 Total consideration 298.4 The value of the equity shares issued is based on the mid-market price of Carillion plc shares at the close of business on 20 April 2011 of 384.36 pence and the total number of shares issued of 30,613,192.
At the point of obtaining control of Eaga plc on 21 April 2011, the shares purchased on 14 February 2011 had a fair value of 49.4 million as a result of the shares becoming ex-dividend.
As a result of re-measuring these shares to fair value on acquisition, a loss of 0.5 million has been recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
This has been offset by the Eaga plc 2011 interim dividend which was paid to Carillion plc in respect of the Eaga plc shares held.
Cash flows associated with the acquisition are included in the cash flow statement as follows: m Total cash paid 181.2 Net cash and cash equivalents acquired 1.5 Net cash outflow on acquisition 182.7 Acquisition costs of 7.5 million were incurred in relation to the acquisition contracts and due diligence procedures.
These costs have been included as a non-operating item in the income statement see note 4.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2011, Carillion Energy Services contributed revenue of 379.8 million and a reported loss after tax of 27.9 million after rationalisation costs and intangible amortisation to consolidated profit for the period.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2011, total revenue would have been 5,293.0 million and profit after tax would have been 36.0 million after non-recurring post-taxation costs of 84.8 million for the year ended 31December 2011.
Disposals in 2012 In 2012, the Group disposed of equity interests in seven Public Private Partnership projects.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 34.8 million which is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments, and a profit of 13.2 million which is included in Group operating profit within the Public Private Partnership projects segment.
In addition, on 29 June 2012 the Group received cash proceeds of 7.1 million on exchange of contracts for the sale of an equity interest in a Public Private Partnership project.
At 31 December 2012, all the conditions precedent had not been met in relation to the sale contract and therefore the disposal of this equity interest has not been recognised.
The proceeds received of 7.1 million have been recognised within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments in the cash flow statement.
Legal completion of the sale occurred in January 2013.
Proceeds of 2.6 million from the disposal of equity interests in land development jointly controlled entities in Canada and 1.4 million fromthe disposal of the Groups investment in HomeSun Holdings Limited are included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments.
The Group disposed of its equity interests in two small wholly owned subsidiaries during the year for a total cash consideration of 1.0 million net of expenses paid of 0.2 million.
The net cash consideration received of 0.1 million net of 0.9 million of cash in the subsidiaries sold isincluded in the cash flow statement within disposal and closure of businesses, together with cash payments of 3.9 million in relation to business closures made in 2012 and 2011.
Disposals in 2011 During 2011, the Group disposed of its equity investments in three Public Private Partnership projects and a small jointly controlled entity in the Netherlands.

Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies andestimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation tofinal out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the discount rate and future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefits In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: expected return on plan assets inflation rate mortality discount rate salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
The valuation of defined benefit pension scheme liabilities in particular, is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate and inflation rate.
A0.1 per cent reduction in the the discount rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 42 million, whilst a 0.1 per cent increase inthe inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by approximately 38 million.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Groups principal activities that are not required to be included on the Group balance sheet.
The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows: operating leases see note 28 pledged assets securing finance lease liabilities see notes 10 and 11 contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance contracts in PPP special purpose entities seenote 26 capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt in PPP special purpose entities see note 28 outsourcing contracts.
In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-office functions with a third party provider.
These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated with these arrangements will not have material impact on the financial position of the Group.

Following this change in presentation, comparative information has been restated accordingly, which has had the following impact on underlying profit before taxation, non-operating items and underlying earnings per share.
