FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 SEGMENT REPORTING IFRS 8 requires segment reporting to be based on the internal financial information reported to the chief operating decision maker.
The groups chief operating decision maker is deemed to be the Executive Committee comprising Peter Crook Chief Executive, Andrew Fisher Finance Director and Chris Gillespie Managing Director, CCD whose primary responsibility it is to manage the groups day-to-day operations and analyse trading performance.
The groups segments comprise CCD, Vanquis Bank and Central which are those segments reported in the groups management accounts used by the Executive Committee as the primary means for analysing trading performance.
The Executive Committee assesses profit performance using profit before tax measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the group financial statements.
This reflects the consistent mix of business over the last two years.
The 32.4% growth in revenue in Vanquis Bank in 2012 reflects the 30.1% increase in UK customer numbers in the year together with the continued success of the credit line increase programme to existing customers.
Central costs reflect the cost of the groups corporate office including legal, finance, treasury, tax, pensions, internal audit, community programme and media and corporate affairs costs.
The costs have increased in 2012 primarily due to higher pension charges and higher compliance and regulatory costs.
Exceptional items in 2012 comprise: i a 17.7m curtailment credit due to severing the link between past accrued benefits and final salary at retirement within the groups defined benefit pension scheme see note 18 : and ii a 2.1m charge relating to the impairment of goodwill in respect of Cheque Exchange Limited, a business originally acquired in 2001 and now subsumed within CCD see note 10.
All of the above activities relate to continuing operations.
Revenue between business segments is not material.

The impact of this is an increase in the notional allocation of group borrowings to CCD of 31.3m 2011: 23.0m and an increase in the notional cash allocated to central activities of the same amount.
The intra-group elimination adjustment removes this notional allocation to state borrowings and cash on a consolidated group basis.
The groups operations operate principally in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
During the first half of 2012, Vanquis Bank established a branch in Poland as part of a pilot credit card operation in that territory.
The revenue in respect of the branch in 2012 amounted to 0.1m 2011: nil and the loss amounted to 3.3m 2011: nil.
The net liabilities of the branch amounted to 1.2m at 31December 2012 2011: nil, comprising assets of 2.8m 2011: nil and liabilities of 4.0m 2011: nil.
These figures are included within the Vanquis Bank figures in the table above.
The intra-group elimination rebases CCDs borrowings to 80% of receivables to bring their borrowings in line with the groups maximum target gearing ratio of 3.5times.
This adjustment essentially eliminates goodwill and intercompany borrowings arising following the capital restructuring of the group in the late 1990s.
Vanquis Banks borrowings broadly equate to 80% of receivables in line with their regulatory capital requirement.

The amortisation charge in 2012 excludes 2.1m of impairment of goodwill see note 10.
2 REVENUE Revenue is recognised by applying the effective interest rate EIR to the carrying value of a loan.
The effective interest rate is calculated at inception and represents the rate which exactly discounts the future contractual cash receipts from a loan to the amount of cash advanced under that loan, plus directly attributable issue costs e. g. aggregator broker fees.
In addition, in CCD the EIR takes account of customers repaying early.
Group 2012 2011 m m Interest income 888.2 840.2 Fee income 91.8 70.6 Total revenue 980.0 910.8 All fee income earned relates to Vanquis Bank.
Interest income relates to the service charge on home credit loans and interest charges on Vanquis Bank credit cards.
Fee income wholly relates to Vanquis Bank and predominantly reflects default and overlimit fees as well as other ancillary income streams such as interchange income and Repayment Option Plan ROP, Identity Theft Alert and ValueSaver fees.
Fee income in 2012 represented 32% 2011: 33% of Vanquis Bank revenue.

The groups blended funding rate in 2012 was 7.2%, down from 7.6% in 2011.
This primarily reflects the development of the retail deposits programme in Vanquis Bank during 2012.
Retail deposits represent approximately 27% of the groups funding at the end of 2012 compared with approximately 13% in 2011.
The all-in blended cost of taking retail deposits in 2012, after the cost of holding a liquid assets buffer was 4.5% 2011: 5.3%.
The group funding rate for 2013 is expected to be around 7%.
Interest cover continues to be one of the groups banking covenants.
It is calculated as profit before tax, interest and amortisation divided by finance costs, excluding net hedge ineffectiveness, and has a minimum requirement of 2.0 times.
Interest cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2012 was 3.5 times compared with 3.3 times in 2011.

The effective tax rate for 2012 prior to exceptional items is 24.5% 2011: 26.1%, in line with the UK statutory corporation tax rate which reduced from 26.0% to 24.0% on 1 April 2012.
The group is expected to benefit in future years from the progressive rate reductions announced in recent budgets.
As a result of the change in UK corporation tax rate which is effective from 1April 2013, deferred tax balances have been re-measured.
The temporary differences on which deferred tax balances have been calculated are expected to reverse after 1April 2013 2011: 1April 2012.
Accordingly, the balances have been calculated using a rate of 23% 2011: 25%.
A tax charge of 0.4m in 2012 2011: 0.3m represents the income statement adjustment to deferred tax as a result of this change.
An additional deferred tax charge of 0.1m in 2012 2011: 0.1m has been taken directly to other comprehensive income, reflecting the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rates on items previously reflected directly in other comprehensive income.

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for treasury shares own shares held.
Diluted EPS calculates the effect on EPS assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated as follows: i For share awards outstanding under performance-related share incentive schemes such as the Performance Share Plan PSP and the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, the number of dilutive potential ordinary shares is calculated based on the number of shares which would be issuable if: i the end of the reporting period is assumed to be the end of the schemes performance period: and ii the performance targets have been met at that date.
ii For share options outstanding under  schemes such as the Save As You Earn scheme SAYE, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of share options outstanding, with the difference being the dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group also presents an adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of any exceptional items.
Reconciliations of basic and diluted earnings per share are set out below: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted average average number of Per share number of Per share Earnings shares amount Earnings shares amount m pence m m pence Group m Earnings per share Shares in issue during the year 138.0 136.8 Own shares held 3.9 3.1 Basic earnings per share 148.0 134.1 110.4 119.8 133.7 89.6 Dilutive effect of share options and awards 2.5 2.1 0.3 0.2 Diluted earnings per share 148.0 136.6 108.3 119.8 134.0 89.4 The directors have elected to show an adjusted earnings per share prior to exceptional items in 2012 see note 1.

If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting on 9May 2013, this dividend will be paid on 21June 2013 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 24May 2013.
This dividend is not reflected in the balance sheet as at 31December 2012 as it is subject to shareholder approval.
At the time of the demerger of the international business in 2007, the board stated its intention to maintain a full-year dividend of 63.5p per share until a dividend cover of 1.25 times was reached and thereafter adopt a progressive dividend profile whilst maintaining a minimum dividend cover of at least 1.25 times.
During 2011, the growth in profit before tax allowed the group to increase its full-year dividend for the first time by 8.7% which resulted in dividend cover of 1.30 times.
As a result of adjusted EPS growth of 13.8% in 2012, the directors have proposed an increase in the final dividend of 14.4% which, together with the 7.9% increase in the interim dividend, makes a total full-year dividend increase of 11.9%.
Accordingly, dividend cover, prior to exceptional items, in 2012 was 1.32 times.
8 DIRECTORS REMUNERATION The remuneration of the directors, who are the key management personnel of the group, is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories specified in IAS 24, Related party disclosures.

It does not include the 9,800 self-employed agents within CCD.
The 2% reduction in CCD employee numbers principally reflects improved efficiency and tight cost control throughout the business.
Vanquis Bank employee numbers have increased by 24% during 2012 due to the growth of the business, including the expansion of the second contact centre in CCDs head office in Bradford.

The increase in the charge from 4.2m in 2011 to 8.0m in 2012 principally reflects a higher defined benefit charge as a result of a lower actuarially assessed return on assets assumption in respect of 2012, compared with the equivalent rate in respect of 2011 across both equities and bonds.
The decrease in the share-based payment charge from 8.0m in 2011 to 6.4m in 2012, primarily reflects a release of prior year provisions due to lower than expected vesting levels from the 2009 Long Term Incentive Scheme.

129 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS On inception of a loan, receivables represent the amounts initially advanced to customers plus directly attributable issue costs.
Subsequently, receivables are increased by the revenue recognised and reduced by cash collections and any deduction for impairment.
Revenue is recognised on the net value of the receivable after deduction for impairment and not on the gross receivable prior to impairment.
Revenue, impairment and receivables example for home credit The simple examples below illustrate the calculation of the receivables balance within the home credit business of CCD and its interaction with revenue and impairment.
Within the home credit business, loans are deemed impaired when two payments are missed within a 12-week cycle.
The following examples are based on a 100 loan with a total amount payable of 182 over 52 weeks which equates to a weekly payment of 3.50.
The effective interest rate applied to the loan is 2.5597% per week.
In the first example, the customer pays in full in line with the loan agreement and in the second example the customer does not repay the full amount due.
Customer pays to contract for 4 weeks, misses 2 payments and then pays 2.00 per week 1.
Where the customer pays to contract, the revenue of 82.00 equals the service charge on the loan.
In the second example, the customer pays to contract for 4 weeks, misses 2 payments and then pays 2.00 per week for 50 weeks but then nothing thereafter.
Cash collected amounts to 114.00 compared with the contractual amount due of 182.00.
Revenue in this example is 59.02 and impairment is 45.02 which results in revenue less impairment of 14.00.
The above examples are simple examples produced to show the mechanics of how revenue and impairment within home credit works and are for illustrative purposes only.
They ignore the impact of early settlement rebates on the calculation of the EIR and are not based on actual impairment rates used by the home credit business.

Home credit receivables showed a modest 0.8% fall in 2012 reflecting relatively subdued demand for credit due to pressure on customers disposable incomes from continued increases in food, fuel and utility prices.
Vanquis Banks UK receivables grew by 41.5% in 2012 as a result of growth in UK customer numbers of 30.1% together with the success of the credit line increase programme to good-quality existing customers through the low and grow approach to lending.
1.8m of Vanquis Banks receivables at the end of 2012 relate to the pilot credit card operation in Poland 2011: nil.
The average effective interest rate for the year ended 31December 2012 was 105% for CCD 2011: 102% and 33% for Vanquis Bank 2011: 34%.
The average period to maturity of the amounts receivable from customers within CCD is 6.0 months 2011: 5.8 months.
Within Vanquis Bank, there is no fixed term for repayment of credit card loans other than a general requirement for customers to make a monthly minimum repayment towards their outstanding balance.
For the majority of customers, this is currently the greater of 1.5% of the amount owed plus any fees and interest charges in the month and 5.
130 PROVIDENT FINANCIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS CONTINUED The fair value of amounts receivable from customers is approximately 2.1 billion 2011: 1.8 billion.
Fair value has been derived by discounting expected future cash flows net of collection costs at the groups weighted average cost of capital at the balance sheet date.
There are no accounts loans within Vanquis Bank which are past due but not impaired.
In home credit, past due but not impaired balances relate to loans which are contractually overdue.
However, contractually overdue loans are not deemed to be impaired unless the customer has missed two or more cumulative weekly payments in the previous 12-week period since only at this point do the expected future cash flows from loans deteriorate materially.
The arrears profile in CCD has been stable over a number of years.
The marginal deterioration in 2012 reflects the relatively subdued demand for credit from the existing customer base which means certain customers who choose not to take further credit do not bring their account up to date.
The favourable change in profile in Vanquis Bank reflects a strong impairment performance and record low delinquency due to the improving quality of the receivables book and the stable UK employment market.
The following table sets out the ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances within the home credit business of CCD based on contractual arrears since the inception of the loan: Group 2012 2011 Ageing analysis of past due but not impaired balances m m One week overdue 90.7 89.8 Two weeks overdue 20.6 22.5 Three weeks or more overdue 26.7 26.2 Past due but not impaired 138.0 138.5 Impairment in Vanquis Bank is deducted from the carrying value of amounts receivable from customers by the use of an allowance account.
The movement in the allowance account during the year is as follows: Group 2012 2011 Vanquis Bank allowance account m m At 1January 62.4 45.9 Charge for the year 95.9 76.9 Amounts written off during the year 71.2 71.0 Amounts recovered during the year 4.3 10.6 At 31December 91.4 62.4 The core customer IT platform within the home credit business of CCD is cash based.
This reflects the fact that the business provides a product whereby all charges are fixed at the outset through the service charge and the focus of the business is on collecting cash.
As a result, the system records the total contractual outstanding amount due from a customer comprising the amount lent to the customer plus the service charge on the loan less cash repayments to date.
The system does not accrue interest revenue as is the case with Vanquis Bank and more mainstream lenders.
In order to translate the cash transactions from the core home credit customer IT platform into an IFRS receivables balance, a separate database is used.
IFRS permits revenue and impairment to be performed on a portfolio basis.
Accordingly, home credits loans are allocated into portfolios based on their product length.
Initial recognition within each portfolio is the cash amount advanced to customers.
Revenue is applied to each portfolio as a whole based on the effective interest rate of that product.
Weekly cash repayments are deducted from each portfolio as cash is collected to arrive at a carrying value.
On a weekly basis, an impairment review is conducted.
Accounts within individual portfolios are placed into arrears stages based on the number of weekly payments missed in the last 12 weeks.
The current carrying value of each arrears stage is then compared with the expected cash flows based on historic performance of each arrears stage discounted at the original effective interest rate the net carrying value.
The net carrying value is the carrying value to which revenue, cash repayments and impairment are applied in the future and the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the net carrying value is recorded as an impairment charge in the income statement.
As revenue and impairment is calculated on the net receivable, a separate gross receivable and allowance or provision account similar to Vanquis Bank and more mainstream banks is not maintained.
Vanquis Banks systems are interest bearing and allow revenue and impairment to be calculated on an account-by-account basis and, therefore, it discloses a gross receivable and an allowance account.
Whilst home credit and Vanquis Bank adopt different accounting approaches to recording receivables, the carrying value of receivables in the balance sheet and the income statement impact of revenue and impairment is not affected.
131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS CONTINUED The impairment charge in respect of amounts receivable from customers reflected within operating costs can be analysed as follows: Group 2012 2011 Impairment charge on amounts receivable from customers m m CCD 230.2 223.8 Vanquis Bank 95.9 76.9 Total group 326.1 300.7 Impairment in CCD increased by 2.9% during 2012 and the ratio of annualised impairment to revenue increased from 32.1% in 2011 to 33.0%.
The increase primarily reflects the benefit to impairment in the second quarter of 2011 from an improvement in the arrears profile which resulted from the enhancements made to the agents commission scheme in April of that year.
The impairment charge and impairment to revenue metric in CCD do not represent what is usually considered as bad debt.
Bad debt is often deemed to be the amount of principal that is not recovered on loans made.
Within the home credit business, the service charge on a loan is fixed regardless of the time taken by a customer to repay a loan.
There is no penalty interest or penalty charges.
Due to their personal circumstances and the variability of their income streams, home credit customers often take longer than the contracted period to repay their loans.
IFRS requires revenue to be recognised on the outstanding receivables at the original effective interest rate EIR set at the outset.
The EIR assumes that a customer pays in line with the contractual term of the loan.
Therefore, when a customer misses a payment, revenue continues to be recognised at the EIR as though penalty interest was being charged to the customer even though contractually it is not.
Because this revenue is never going to be charged to the customer, a corresponding impairment charge is made.
This gross up of revenue and impairment is illustrated in the following example.
The example is based on a 100 loan with a total amount payable of 182 over 52 weeks which equates to a weekly payment of 3.50.
In this example, the customer pays to contract for 4 weeks, misses 2 payments and then pays 3.00 per week for the following 56 weeks.
The total amount payable of 182 is received in full but over a total period of 62 weeks instead of 52 weeks.
Revenue less impairment in this example is 82.00, consistent with a customer paying to contract.
However, because the customer took 10 more weeks to pay their loan, revenue increases to 94.33 and is offset by impairment of 12.33.
The gross up of revenue and impairment is therefore 12.33.
The above is a simple example produced to show the mechanics of how the gross up within the home credit business works and is for illustrative purposes only.
It ignores the impact of early settlement rebates on the calculation of the EIR and is not based on actual impairment rates used by the home credit business.
The income statement for the home credit business therefore includes a gross up of revenue and impairment representing the additional revenue and impairment on loans which take longer than contract to repay.
In practice, based on the total amount of cash collected against the amount lent to a customer plus the service charge on loans, bad debt in the home credit business is less than half of the 33% impairment to revenue metric.
Impairment in Vanquis Bank increased by 24.7% in 2012 compared with a 37.4% increase in UK average receivables.
This reflects record low delinquency resulting from the stable employment market together with continued improvement in the underlying quality of the receivables book, resulting from the progressive tightening of underwriting between 2007 and 2009.
132 PROVIDENT FINANCIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM CUSTOMERS CONTINUED Interest income recognised on amounts receivable from customers which have been impaired can be analysed as follows: Group 2012 2011 Interest income recognised on impaired amounts receivable from customers m m CCD 344.8 346.7 Vanquis Bank 22.9 19.4 Total group 367.7 366.1 IFRS requires interest revenue to be recognised on the net carrying value of a receivable after deductions for impairment and not on the outstanding amount of the loan prior to impairment.
Using Vanquis Bank as an example, whilst interest revenue for customer statement balances is broadly calculated on the gross receivables balance of 734.7m subject to the normal suspension of interest where applicable and the timing of customer payments, interest revenue for IFRS purposes is calculated based on the net receivables balance of 643.3m, which is stated after the deduction of the impairment allowance account of 91.4m.
The non-standard customers served by the group are generally more likely to miss payments compared with more mainstream customers.
As the group recognises impairment events early after missing 2 weekly payments in the last 12weeks in home credit and after missing 1 monthly payment in Vanquis Bank the groups level of revenue on impaired loans is comparatively high.
The currency profile of amounts receivable from customers is as follows: Group 2012 2011 Currency profile of amounts receivable from customers m m Sterling 1,451.0 1,274.7 Euro 61.0 58.0 Zloty 1.8 Total group 1,513.8 1,332.7 Euro receivables represent loans issued by the home credit business in the Republic of Ireland, and amount to 7% of CCDs receivables 2011: 7%.

a Hedging reserve movements The fair value of derivatives is required to be reflected in the balance sheet.
Generally, providing the derivatives meet certain accounting requirements, any movement in the fair value of the derivatives caused by fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates is deferred in the hedging reserve and does not impact the income statement.
The groups current derivatives all meet these criteria.
If the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are higher than the current interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative liability is recognised.
Conversely, if the interest rates payable on interest rate swaps are lower than the current floating interest rate at the balance sheet date, then a derivative asset is recognised.
The groups US private placement borrowings denominated in US dollars are recognised in the balance sheet at the year-end exchange rate.
As these borrowings are subject to cross currency swaps which fix the translation rate of the borrowings the difference between the borrowing based on the contracted rate of exchange and the borrowing based on the year-end rate of exchange is recorded in the hedging reserve.
The value of this adjustment at 31December 2012 is 5.8m 2011: 11.2m.
The movement in the hedging reserve within equity as a result of the changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments can be summarised asfollows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Interest rate swaps 0.1 1.6 0.1 1.6 2003 cross-currency swaps 0.3 2004 cross-currency swaps 0.3 0.3 Foreign exchange contracts 0.4 0.4 Net charge credit to the hedging reserve 0.6 1.4 0.1 1.6 Under IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, all derivative financial instruments are classed as Level 2 as they are not traded in an active market and the fair value is therefore determined through discounting future cash flows, using appropriate observable rates.

c Interest rate swaps The group and company use interest rate swaps in order to manage the interest rate risk on the groups borrowings.
The group has entered into various interest rate swaps which were designated and effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges at inception.
The movement in the fair value of effective interest rate swaps during the year was as follows: Group and company 2012 2011 m m Liability at 1January 9.5 14.8 Credited to the hedging reserve 0.1 1.6 Movement in fair value of ineffective interest rate swaps credited to the income statement 1.6 Cash settlement of interest rate swaps 2.1 Liability at 31December 9.4 9.5 The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the interest rate swaps held by the group and company were asfollows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity Group and company % % years % % years Sterling 3.2 3.1 3.3 3.1 2.0 1.0 3.4 1.4 d Cross-currency swaps The group and company use cross-currency swaps in order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk arising on the groups US private placement loan notes issued in 2001, 2003 and 2004.
2001 and 2003 private placement loan notes The group and company put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed-rate interest of the 2001 and 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes into fixed-rate sterling liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps matched the underlying loan notes.
These swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the corresponding exchange rate movements on the underlying loan notes were deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2001 US dollar private placement loan notes matured in 2011 in line with the underlying borrowings.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group and company 2012 2011 m m Liability at 1January 1.4 Exchange rate movement 1.4 Liability at 31December The exchange rate movement of 1.4m debit in 2011 reflected the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
Corresponding entries are made within borrowings.
137 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 16 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The cross-currency swaps used to hedge the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes have an interest rate of 6.8% 2011: 6.8%, and a weighted average period to maturity of 0.3 years 2011: 1.3 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2012 2011 m m Asset at 1January 0.3 0.4 Exchange rate movement 2.2 0.2 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.3 Liability asset at 31December 1.9 0.3 The difference between the translation of the 2003 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to a credit of 1.9m 2011: debit of 0.3m.
The exchange rate movement of 2.2m credit 2011: debit of 0.2m reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cross-currency swaps and the exchange rate movements described above.
2004 private placement loan notes The group has put in place cross-currency swaps to swap the principal and fixed rate interest of the US dollar private placement loan notes issued in 2004 into floating rate sterling-denominated interest liabilities.
The maturity dates of the cross-currency swaps match the underlying loan notes.
The swaps comprise both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges.
The cash flow hedge portion of the swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and continue to be effective under IAS 39 in the year ended 31December 2012.
The fair value movements in the swaps and the exchange movements in the underlying loan notes have been deferred in the hedging reserve within equity.
The fair value hedge portion of the swaps were designated and were effective under IAS 39 as fair value hedges during the year.
As a result, fair value movements in the swaps were charged to the income statement with a corresponding entry made to the underlying loan notes within borrowings for the effective portion of the swaps, leaving a net charge within the income statement reflecting the net fair value loss on the fair value hedge in the year.
The swaps have a range of interest rates of LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% 2011: LIBOR 1.61% to LIBOR 1.63% and a weighted average period to maturity of 1.6 years 2011: 2.6 years.
The movement in the fair value of the swaps can be analysed as follows: Group 2012 2011 m m Asset at 1January 11.6 15.5 Exchange rate movement 3.2 3.6 Charged to the hedging reserve 0.3 0.3 Asset at 31December 8.1 11.6 The difference between the translation of the 2004 US dollar private placement loan notes at the year-end exchange rate compared with the contracted exchange rate amounts to a debit of 7.7m 2011: debit of 10.9m.
The exchange rate movement of 3.2m credit 2011: credit of 3.6m reflects the movement in the year of this difference in translation.
The amount charged to the hedging reserve reflects the difference between the movement in the fair value of the cash flow hedge portion of the cross-currency swaps and the cash flow hedge portion of the exchange rate movements described above.
e Foreign exchange contracts The group uses foreign exchange contracts in order to manage the foreign exchange rate risk arising from CCDs euro operations in the Republic of Ireland and Vanquis Banks branch in Poland.
A liability of 0.1m is held in the group balance sheet as at 31December 2012 in respect of foreign exchange contracts 2011: asset of 0.3m.
The groups foreign exchange contracts comprise forward foreign exchange contracts to buy sterling and sell euros for a total notional amount of 6.1m 2011: 6.7m and zloty for 1.4m 2011: nil.
These contracts have a range of maturity dates from 31January 2013 to 15October 2013 2011: 14February 2012 to 13November 2012.
These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges and were effective under IAS 39.
Accordingly, the movement in fair value of 0.4m has been charged to the hedging reserve within equity 2011: credit of 0.4m.

There is no collateral held in respect of trade and other receivables 2011: nil.
18 RETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSET a Pension schemes defined benefit The retirement benefit asset reflects the difference between the present value of the groups obligation to current and past employees to provide a defined benefit pension and the fair value of assets held to meet that obligation.
As at 31December 2012, the fair value of the assets exceeded the obligation and hence a net pension asset has been recorded.
The groups defined benefit pension scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1January 2003.
The group operates a defined benefit scheme: the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme.
The scheme has been substantially closed to new members since 1January 2003.
The scheme covers 57% of employees with company-provided pension arrangements and is of the funded, defined benefit type.
Following a full group review of pension scheme arrangements, from 1April 2006 members were provided with a choice of paying higher member contributions to continue accruing benefits based on final salary or paying a lower member contribution and accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary which would be revalued each year.
For members that switched to paying lower member contributions, the benefits accrued before they switched would retain a link to their final salary at retirement.
During 2012, the group further reviewed its pension arrangements and from 31December 2012 the link to final salary at retirement will no longer apply.
Furthermore, no future final salary benefits will accrue, with all members now accruing benefits based on a percentage of salary that is revalued each year.
As a result of this change, the past accrued final salary benefits will increase in the future in line with statutory revaluations now linked to CPI inflation, rather than in line with future salary increases.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1June 2009 by a qualified independent actuary.
A valuation as at 1June 2012 is currently in progress but is not yet finalised.
The valuation used for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits has been based on the preliminary results of the 2012 valuation, updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at the balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the balance sheet date.

140 PROVIDENT FINANCIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 18 RETIREMENT BENEFIT ASSET CONTINUED Movements in the fair value of scheme assets were as follows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Fair value of scheme assets at 1January 525.0 514.1 135.5 132.1 Expected return on scheme assets 27.5 32.0 9.3 9.8 Actuarial movement on scheme assets 23.4 18.4 7.2 3.0 Contributions by the group company 10.1 10.0 0.4 0.5 Net benefits paid out 15.3 12.7 4.7 3.9 Fair value of scheme assets at 31December 570.7 525.0 147.7 135.5 The contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme in the year ending 31December 2013 are expected to be approximately 16m.
Movements in the present value of the defined benefit obligation were as follows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 1January 511.5 473.1 131.3 119.5 Current service cost 6.8 7.0 2.1 2.1 Interest cost 24.9 25.4 7.7 7.8 Exceptional curtailment credit 17.7 2.1 Actuarial movement on scheme liabilities 37.5 18.7 11.5 5.8 Net benefits paid out 15.3 12.7 4.7 3.9 Present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31December 547.7 511.5 145.8 131.3 The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: Group and company 2012 2011 % % Price inflation 3.00 3.00 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.00 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.80 3.00 Inflationary increases to pensions in deferment 2.25 2.00 Discount rate 4.50 4.90 Long-term rate of return equities 7.20 7.50 bonds 4.50 4.90 fixed interest gilts 2.50 index-linked gilts 3.00 2.50 cash and money market funds 2.50 2.50 overall weighted average 5.30 5.40 The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets under the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity investments reflect anticipated long-term real rates of return.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate should be determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high-quality corporate bonds and that the term of the instruments chosen should be consistent with the estimated term of the defined benefit obligations.
In the UK, this is usually interpreted to mean the yield on AA-rated corporate bonds of an appropriate term.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would increase decrease the retirement benefit asset by approximately 11m 2011: 10m.
The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme are based on the mortality experience of self-administered pension schemes and allow for future improvements in life expectancy.
The group has updated the mortality assumption to be in line with the assumptions proposed for the 1June 2012 actuarial valuation.
The group uses the S1PA standard tables as the basis for projecting mortality adjusted for the following factors: A 5% upwards adjustment to mortality rates for males and a 15% upwards adjustment for females is made in order to reflect lower life expectancies within the scheme compared to average pension schemes: and Future mortality improvements are in line with CMI 2011 projections with long-term trend improvements of 1.25% per annum.
In more simple terms, it is now assumed that members who retire in the future at age 65 will live on average for a further 24 years if they are male 2011: 23 years and for a further 26 years if they are female 2011: 25 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater for the scheme, the retirement benefit asset would have been reduced by approximately 20m 2011: 20m.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group and company.
The pension charge in the consolidated income statement represents contributions paid by the group in respect of the plan and amounted to 3.8m for the year ended 31December 2012 2011: 3.8m.
Contributions made by the company amounted to 0.4m 2011: 0.4m.
No contributions were payable to the fund at the year end 2011: nil.
The group contributed 0.1m to personal pension plans in the year 2011: 0.1m.
In December 2011, the Finance Act introduced the Reduced Annual Allowance, which limited the benefits that can be provided by the groups registered pension schemes on a tax-efficient basis to 50,000 in any year.
This limit is in addition to HMRCs Lifetime Allowance of 1.5m.
As a result of these limits, those affected have been provided with a number of alternative options by the group, principally: i participation in an Unfunded, Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS : ii a cash supplement payable in lieu of pension contributions payable: and iii contributions payable into a self-invested personal pension plan SIPP.
In 2012 both the group and company have contributed 0.3m 2011: 0.3m into the UURBS, 0.1m 2011: 0.1m into cash supplements and 0.1m 2011: 0.1m into SIPPs.
19 DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is a future tax liability or asset, resulting from temporary differences or timing differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their value for tax purposes.
Deferred tax arises primarily in respect of derivatives, the groups pension asset and property, plant and equipment which are depreciated on a different basis for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the balance sheet liability method.
The temporary differences, on which deferred tax balances have been calculated, are expected to reverse after 1April 2013 2011: 1April 2012.
Accordingly, the balances have been calculated using a tax rate of 23% 2011: 25%.
The movement in the deferred tax asset during the year can be analysed as follows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 Asset m m m m At 1January 7.5 2.8 3.6 1.9 Charge credit to the income statement note 5 4.4 4.3 0.4 0.1 Credit on other comprehensive income prior to change in UK tax rate note 5 3.5 9.4 1.0 1.9 Impact of change in UK tax rate: charge to the income statement 0.4 0.3 0.1 charge to other comprehensive income 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.3 At 31December 6.1 7.5 4.0 3.6 The change in the UK tax rate relates to the impact of the change in UK corporation tax rate from 24% 2011: 26% to 23% 2011: 25% which will be effective from 1April 2013 2011: 1April 2012 see note 5.

20 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents includes cash at bank, floats held by agents within CCD and Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer held in accordance with the FSAs liquidity regime.
The FSA requires regulated entities to maintain a liquid assets buffer to ensure they have a liquid source of funds to help protect against unforeseen circumstances.
Vanquis Banks liquid assets buffer amounts to 52.3m in 2012 2011: 17.5m and represents cash deposited in a designated money market fund which invests in UK Government bonds.
Vanquis Bank has been operating under the FSAs transitional arrangements, whereby firms were only required to hold 30% of the amount calculated under the simplified regime until March 2012, increasing to 50% to July 2013, 70% to January 2016 and to 100% thereafter.
Following the increase to 50% in March 2012, the FSA has subsequently confirmed there will be no further increases under the transitional arrangements for the foreseeable future.
Vanquis Bank has been operating as a simplified firm under the liquidity regime and therefore the liquid assets buffer has been calculated as 10% to 20% of retail deposits taken, principally depending on maturity, plus 25% of the undrawn credit lines on credit cards.
Vanquis Bank no longer meets the definition of a simplified firm due to the mix of funding between retail deposits and intercompany funding.
As a result, from 1February 2013, Vanquis Bank is now a standard firm for liquidity purposes.
This has two impacts: 1 the FSA will set revised liquidity requirements called Individual Liquidity Guidance ILG following completion by management of an Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment ILAA.
The ILAA is the liquidity equivalent of the ICAAP produced for regulatory capital purposes.
Pending the completion of the ILAA, Vanquis Bank has agreed with the FSA that it will continue to operate to its historical liquidity requirements: and 2 the liquid assets buffer is required to be held in the form of Government gilts or in a Bank of England Reserve Account and can no longer be held in a designated money market fund.

145 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21 BANK AND OTHER BORROWINGS CONTINUED c Interest rate and currency profile of bank and other borrowings Before taking account of the various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements entered into by the group and company, the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposure on borrowings is as follows: 2012 2011 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Group m m m m m m Sterling 777.7 271.2 1,048.9 471.7 427.5 899.2 US dollar 90.7 90.7 96.1 96.1 Euro 61.8 61.8 54.3 54.3 Total group 868.4 333.0 1,201.4 567.8 481.8 1,049.6 2012 2011 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total Company m m m m m m Sterling 448.3 269.2 717.5 330.0 226.4 556.4 Euro 61.8 61.8 54.3 54.3 Total company 448.3 331.0 779.3 330.0 280.7 610.7 As detailed in note 16, the group and company have entered into various interest rate swaps and cross-currency swap arrangements to hedge the interest rate and foreign exchange rate exposures on borrowings.
After taking account of the aforementioned interest rate swaps, the groups fixed rate borrowings are 988.4m 2011: 897.8m and the companys fixed rate borrowings are 568.3m 2011: 550.0m.
After taking account of cross-currency swaps, the group and company have no foreign exchange rate exposure to borrowings denominated in US dollars 2011:nil.
d Senior public bonds On 23October 2009, the company issued 250m of senior public bonds.
The bonds have an annual coupon of 8.0% and are repayable on 23October2019.

On 24April 2003, the group issued loan notes as follows: i US$44m of 5.81% loan notes matured and repaid on 24April 2010: and ii US$76m of 6.34% loan notes repayable on 24April 2013.
On 12August 2004, the group issued loan notes as follows: i US$30m of 6.02% loan notes matured and repaid on 12August 2011: ii US$67m of 6.45% loan notes repayable on 12August 2014: and iii 2m of 7.01% loan notes repayable on 12August 2014.
As set out in note 21 c, cross-currency swaps have been put in place to swap the proceeds and liabilities for principal and interest under the USdollar-denominated loan notes into sterling.
On 13January 2011, the company entered into a committed 100m facility agreement with the Prudential M&G Investments UK Companies Financing Fund to provide a 10-year term loan which amortises between years 5 and 10.
The facility bears interest at rates linked to LIBOR.
The company subsequently entered into the following arrangements with third-party debt providers: 3February 2011 10m facility agreement over a 7-year period at rates linked to EURIBOR: 4March 2011 20m private placement loan notes over a 7-year period at rates linked to LIBOR: and 24May 2011 14.5m private placement loan notes over a 4-year period at rates linked to EURIBOR.
The company has the option to repay the notes after 3 years.
146 PROVIDENT FINANCIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 21 BANK AND OTHER BORROWINGS CONTINUED f Retail bonds On 14April 2010, the company issued 25.2m of retail bonds which have an all-in cost of 7.5%, comprising a 7.0% interest rate payable to the bond holder and 0.5% payable to the distributor, and are repayable on 14April2020.
On 25March 2011, the company issued 50.0m of retail bonds which accrue interest at 7.5% and are repayable on 30September 2016.
On 4April 2012, the company issued a further 120.0m of retail bonds which accrue interest at 7.0% and are repayable on 4October 2017. g Retail deposits Vanquis Bank is an FSA regulated bank and commenced taking retail deposits in July 2011.
As at 31December 2012, 327.4m 2011: 139.7m of fixed-rate, fixed-term retail deposits of 1, 2, 3 and 5 years had been taken.
The deposits have been issued at rates of between 2.21% and 4.65%.
A reconciliation of the movement in retail deposits is set out below: Group 2012 2011 m m At 1January 139.7 New funds received 204.8 139.7 Maturities 33.5 Maturities retained 16.4 At 31December 327.4 139.7 The retention rate on retail deposits maturing was 49%.
h Subordinated loan notes On 15June 2005, the company issued 100.0m of subordinated loan notes repayable on 15June 2015.
94.0m of the liability was settled in 2009.
The rights of repayment to holders of the loan notes are subordinated to all other borrowings and liabilities of the company upon a winding up of the company and, in certain circumstances, upon its administration.
i Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The groups funding and liquidity policy is designed to ensure that the group is able to continue to fund the growth of the business.
The group therefore maintains headroom on its committed borrowing facilities to fund growth and contractual maturities for at least the following 12 months, after assuming that Vanquis Bank will fund 90% of its receivables book through retail deposits.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31December were as follows: Group and company 2012 2011 m m Expiring within one year 197.9 Expiring within one to two years 90.2 Expiring in more than two years 191.9 Total group and company 191.9 288.1 The table above excludes the additional capacity for Vanquis Bank to take retail deposits up to the permitted level of 90% of its receivables set by the FSA.
As an FSA-regulated business, Vanquis Bank cannot lend funds to its parent as this would breach its large exposures rules.
As a result, the additional retail deposits capacity at 31December 2012 is the lower of: i 90% of Vanquis Banks receivables of 643.3m less retail deposits of 327.4m after setting aside the necessary liquid assets buffer of 18.9m.
This amounts to 232.7m: and ii the Vanquis Bank intercompany loan from Provident Financial plc of 202.1m.

Provident Financial plc sponsors the Provident Financial plc 2007 Employee Benefit Trust EBT which is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of the employees of the group.
The company has appointed Kleinwort Benson Jersey Trustees Limited to act as trustee of the EBT.
The trustee has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The shares have been acquired by the EBT to meet obligations under the Provident Financial Long Term Incentive Scheme 2006.
Provident Financial plc also sponsors the Performance Share Plan Trust which was established to operate in conjunction with the Performance Share Plan PSP.
As at 31December 2012, awards under the PSP, held in the name of the individual subject to the award, were 695,009 2011: 754,132 ordinary shares with a cost of 0.1m 2011: 0.7m and a market value of 9.4m 2011: 7.1m.

As the trust no longer held any ordinary shares in the company, the trust was wound up on 7February 2011.
149 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 24 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The group issues share options and awards to senior employees as part of its employee remuneration packages.
The group operates three share schemes: the Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS, employees savings-related share option schemes typically referred to as Save As You Earn schemes SAYE, and the Performance Share Plan PSP.
The group also previously operated senior executive share option schemes ESOS SESO, although no options have been granted under these schemes since 2006.
When a share option or award is granted, a fair value is calculated based on the current share price, probability of the option award vesting, the groups recent share price volatility, and the risk associated with the option award.
The fair value of all options is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying option award.
The charge to the income statement in 2012 was 6.4m for the group 2011: 8.0m and 3.3m for the company 2011: 4.0m.
During 2012, awards options have been granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes 2011: awards options granted under the LTIS, PSP and SAYE schemes.
The reduction in the share-based payment charge from 8.0m in 2011 to 6.4m in 2012, principally reflects a release of prior year provisions due to lower than expected vesting levels from the 2009 LTIS.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds.
