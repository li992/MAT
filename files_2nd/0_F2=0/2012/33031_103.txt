Impairment review of goodwill $ million Goodwill at 31 December 2012 2011 Upstream 7,533 7,931 Downstream 4,168 4,014 Other businesses and corporate 160 155 11,861 12,100 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
For Upstream, goodwill is held at the segment level.
For Downstream, goodwill has been allocated to the Rhine fuels value chain FVC, Lubricants and Other.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit CGU or groups of CGUs including goodwill is compared with the recoverable amount of the CGU or groups of CGUs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is deemed to be the value in use.

Impairment review of goodwill continued The group calculates the value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the cash-generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located.
The rate to be applied to each country is reassessed each year.
Discount rates of 12% and 14% have been used for goodwill impairment calculations performed in 2012 2011 12% and 14%.
The business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use.
They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products e. g. gasoline and lubricants, revenues, costs and capital expenditure.
As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various environmental assumptions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates, are set by senior management.
These environmental assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability.
Upstream $ million 2012 2011 Goodwill 7,533 7,931 Excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount 26,614 49,247 The value in use is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing field.
As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from BPs past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by BPs management.
Capital expenditure and operating costs for the first four years and expected hydrocarbon production profiles up to 2020 are derived from the business segment plan.
Estimated production quantities and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis are developed to be consistent with this.
The production profiles used are consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of BPs centrally-controlled process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Consistent with prior years, the 2012 review for impairment was carried out during the fourth quarter.
The table above shows the carrying amount of the goodwill for the segment and the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount the headroom.
Consistent with prior periods, midstream and intangible oil and gas assets were excluded from the headroom calculation.
The Brent oil price assumption used in the impairment review of goodwill is shown in the table below.
2012 2018 and 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 thereafter Brent oil price $ bbl 105 100 96 93 91 90 2011 2017 and 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter Brent oil price $ bbl 106 101 97 94 92 90 Key assumptions for oil and gas prices for the first five years were derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter.
Prices in 2018 and beyond were determined using long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and using information from external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas or, where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The key assumptions required for the value-in-use estimation are the oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate.
The sensitivity of the headroom to changes in the key assumptions was estimated.
A change in any one variable will impact multiple other inputs to the calculation such that the relationship between any variables will not be linear.
In order to simplify the sensitivity calculations they were performed assuming a change to the variable being tested only.
A detailed calculation on any given change in assumptions may therefore produce a different result.
It was estimated that if the oil price assumption for all future years was around 12% lower than the current assumption for 2018 and beyond, this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related non-current assets of the segment.
It was estimated that no reasonably possible change in the long-term price of natural gas would cause the headroom to be reduced to zero.
Estimated production volumes are based on detailed data for the fields and take into account development plans for the fields agreed by management as part of the long-term planning process.
The average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing over the next 15 years is 563mmboe per year.
In 2012, it was estimated that if this production were to be reduced by around 7% for the whole of this period then this would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related non-current assets of the segment.
Management believes that currently there is no reasonably possible change in discount rate that would cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
