Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, as described on pages 59-62, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for future costs.
Liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and contingent liabilities have been accounted for and or disclosed in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These are discussed in further detail in Note 36 for provisions and Note 43 for contingent liabilities.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the $20-billion trust fund which was established in 2010 are accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 5 Rights to Interests Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds.
Key aspects of the accounting for the oil spill are summarized below.
The financial impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement of the group are shown in the table below.
Amounts related to the trust fund are separately identified.
The cumulative income statement charge does not include amounts for obligations that BP considers are not possible, at this time, to measure reliably.
For further information see Note 43.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all the obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors, as discussed in Note 43, including in relation to any new information or future developments.
These could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The risks associated with the incident could also heighten the impact of the other risks to which the group is exposed as further described in Risk factors on pages 38-44.
Trustfund In 2010, BP established the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill Trust the Trust to be funded in the amount of $20 billion the trust fund over the period to the fourth quarter of 2013, which is available to satisfy legitimate individual and business claims that were previously administered by the Gulf Coast Claims Facility GCCF, state and local government claims resolved by BP, final judgments and settlements, state and local response costs, and natural resource damages and related costs.
The Trust is available to satisfy claims that were previously processed through the transitional court-supervised claims facility, to fund the qualified settlement funds QSFs established under the terms of the settlement agreements with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC administered through the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP, and the separate BP claims programme see below for further information.
Fines, penalties and claims administration costs are not covered by the trust fund.
The establishment of the trust fund does not represent a cap or floor on BPs liabilities and BP does not admit to a liability of this amount.
In 2010, BP contributed $5 billion to the fund, and further regular contributions totalling $5 billion were made in 2011.
During 2011, BP also contributed the cash settlements received from MOEX, Weatherford and Anadarko, amounting in total to $5.1 billion.
A further cash settlement from Cameron was received in January 2012 and was also contributed to the trust fund.
As a result of these accelerated contributions and BPs regular contributions, the $20-billion commitment was paid in full during 2012.
The income statement charge for 2010 included $20 billion in relation to the trust fund, adjusted to take account of the time value of money.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued Under the terms of the Trust agreement, BP has no right to access the funds once they have been contributed to the trust fund and BP has no decisionmaking role in connection with the payment by the trust fund of individual and business claims resolved by the GCCF and the new court-supervised claims processes referred to below.
BP will receive funds from the trust fund only upon its expiration, if there are any funds remaining at that point.
Any amount remaining in the trust fund when the trustees determine that all claims have been settled would be returned to BP.
However, it is not possible to reliably estimate the number or total amount of the claims that will be settled from the trust fund, and therefore it is not possible to reliably measure the fair value of BPs residual interest in it.
The carrying amount of BPs residual interest is, consequently, nil.
BP has the authority under the Trust agreement to present certain resolved claims, including natural resource damages claims and state and local response claims, to the Trust for payment, by providing the trustees with all the required documents establishing that such claims are valid under the Trust agreement.
However, any such payments can only be made on the authority of the trustees and any funds distributed are paid directly to the claimants, not to BP.
BP will not settle any such items directly or receive reimbursement from the trust fund for such items.
BPs obligation to make contributions to the trust fund was recognized in full in 2010, amounting to $20 billion on an undiscounted basis.
On initial recognition the discounted amount recognized was $19,580 million.
The funding of the Trust has now been completed.
The table below shows movements in the funding obligation during the period to 31 December 2012.
The remaining liability of $22 million at 31 December 2012 represents amounts reimbursable to the Trust for administrative costs incurred.
$ million 2012 2011 2010 At 1 January 4,872 14,901 Trust fund liability initially recognized discounted 19,580 Unwinding of discount 12 52 73 Change in discounting 43 240 Contributions 4,860 10,140 5,000 Other 2 16 8 At 31 December 22 4,872 14,901 An asset has been recognized representing BPs right to receive reimbursement from the trust fund.
This is the portion of the estimated future expenditure provided for that will be settled by payments from the trust fund.
We use the term reimbursement asset to describe this asset.
BP will not actually receive any reimbursements from the trust fund, instead payments will be made directly to claimants from the trust fund, and BP will be released from its corresponding obligation.
The provision was increased during the year for items that will be covered by the trust fund by $1,985 million 2011 $4,038 million and payments of $4,624 million 2011 $3,707 million were made during the year from the trust fund.
This includes payments from the trust fund to the seafood compensation fund and payments from QSFs other than the seafood compensation fund to claimants.
In addition, a provision of $794 million was derecognized relating to items that will be covered by the trust fund but which can no longer be reliably estimated.
The remaining reimbursement asset as at 31 December 2012 was $6,442 million and is recorded within other receivables on the balance sheet.
The amount of the reimbursement asset is equal to the amount of provisions as at 31 December 2012 that will be covered by the trust fund see Note 36 in the table under Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Movements in the reimbursement asset are presented in the table below.
$ million 2012 2011 2010 At 1 January 9,875 9,544 Increase in provision for items covered by the trust fund 1,985 4,038 12,567 Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 794 Amounts paid directly by the trust fund 4,624 3,707 3,023 At 31 December 6,442 9,875 9,544 Of which current 4,178 8,233 5,943 non-current 2,264 1,642 3,601 The amount charged or credited in the income statement, before finance costs, related to the trust fund comprises: $ million 2012 2011 2010 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 43 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset, net 1,191 4,038 12,567 Other 8 Total credit charge relating to the trust fund 1,191 3,995 7,261 As noted above, the obligation to fund the $20-billion trust fund was recognized in full in 2010, on a discounted basis.
In addition, a reimbursement asset was recognized, reflecting the portion of provisions recognized that will be covered by the trust fund.
Any new provisions, or increases in provisionsthatare covered by the trust fund up to the amount of $20 billion have no net income statement effect as a reimbursement asset is also recognized, as described above.
During 2012, a further net charge of $1,191 million 2011 $4,038 million was recognized for new, increased and derecognized provisions for items covered by the trust fund with a corresponding increase in the reimbursement asset, resulting in no net income statement effect.
The cumulative net charges for provisions, and the associated reimbursement asset, recognized from 2010 to 2012 amounted to $17,796 million.
Thus, a further $2,204 million could be provided in subsequent periods for items covered by the trust fund with no net impact on the income statement.
Such future increases in amounts provided could arise from adjustments to existing provisions, or from the initial recognition of provisions for items that currently cannot be estimated reliably, namely natural resource damages claims under Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 other than the estimated costs of the assessment phase and the costs of early restoration agreements referred to below, the cost of business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP, or any other potential litigation including through excluded parties from the PSC settlement and any obligation in relation to other potential private or governmental litigation.
Further information on those items that currently cannot be reliably estimated is provided under Provisions and contingencies below and in Note 43.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The $20-billion trust fund may not be sufficient to satisfy all claims under OPA 90 or otherwise that will ultimately be paid.
The Trust agreement does not require BP to make further contributions to the trust fund in excess of the agreed $20 billion should this be insufficient to cover all claims administered by the GCCF and the new court-supervised claims processes, or to settle other items that are covered by the trust fund, as described above.
Should the $20-billion trust fund not be sufficient, BP would commence settling legitimate claims and other costs by making payments directly to claimants or directly to the QSFs, as appropriate.
In this case, increases in estimated future expenditure above $20 billion would be recognized as provisions with a corresponding charge in the income statement.
The provisions would be utilized and derecognized at the point that BP made the payments.
Under the terms of the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement, several QSFs were established during 2012.
These QSFs each relate to specific elements of the agreement, have and will be funded through payments from the Trust, and are available to make payments to claimants in accordance with those elements of the agreement.
As at 31 December 2012, the cash balances in the Trust and the QSFs amounted to $10,471 million, including $1,847 million remaining in the seafood compensation fund yet to be distributed.
Under the terms of the Economic and Property Damage Settlement, the QSFs are subject to certain minimum balances that shall be maintained in the respective funds.
The Economic and Property Damages Settlement with the PSC provides for a transition from the GCCF to the DHCSSP.
A transitional claims facility for economic and property damages claims commenced operation in March 2012.
The transitional claims facility ceased processing new claims in June 2012.
The DHCSSP began processing new claims from claimants under the Economic and Property Damages Settlement.
In addition, a separate BP claims programme began processing claims from claimants not in the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Class as determined by the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement or who have requested to opt out of that settlement.
Moreover, upon the effective date of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement that is, after any appeals of the final approval of that settlement are exhausted, a separate court-supervised settlement programme will begin paying medical claims and implementing other aspects of the medical benefits settlement, such as the Periodic Medical Consultation Program.
In addition, some payments to projects under the Gulf Region Health Outreach Program portion of the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement have already been made.
BP pledged certain Gulf of Mexico assets, through an overriding royalty interest, as collateral for the obligation to fund the Trust pursuant to an agreement entered into in September 2010.
As noted above, in November 2012 BP met its $20-billion funding obligation to the Trust.
Upon completion of the funding obligation, the overriding royalty interest provided as collateral terminated pursuant to its terms.
 At 31 December 2012, BP has recorded certain provisions and disclosed certain contingent liabilities as a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
These are described below under Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Other items.
Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 The claims against BP under OPA 90 fall into three categories: i claims by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources Individual and Business Claims : ii claims by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims : and iii claims by the United States, a State trustee, an Indian tribe trustee, or a foreign trustee for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
In addition, BP faces civil litigation in which claims for liability under OPA 90 along with other causes of actions, including personal injury claims, are asserted by individuals, businesses and government entities.
Provisions have been recorded for Individual and Business Claims and State and Local Claims, except as noted below.
A provision has also been recorded for claims administration costs, natural resource damage assessment costs and costs relating to early natural resource damages restoration agreements.
BP considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to natural resource damage claims other than the estimated costs of the assessment phase and the costs relating to early restoration agreements, the cost of business economic loss claims under the PSC settlement not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP, or any other potential litigation including through excluded parties from the PSC settlement and any obligation in relation to other potential private or governmental litigation, fines, or penalties, other than as described above.
These items are therefore disclosed as contingent liabilities see Note 43 for further information.
Significant uncertainties exist in relation to the amount of claims that are to be paid and will become payable through the claims process established pursuant to the PSC settlement.
There is significant uncertainty in relation to the amounts that ultimately will be paid in relation to current claims, and the number, type and amounts payable for claims not yet reported.
In addition, there is further uncertainty in relation to interpretations of the claims administrator regarding the protocols under the Economic and Property Damages Settlement and judicial interpretation of these protocols, and the outcomes of any further litigation including in relation to potential opt-outs from the settlement or otherwise.
See Note 36 for further information.
The $20-billion trust fund described above is available to satisfy the OPA 90 claims and litigation referred to above.
BPs rights and obligations in relation to the trust fund have been recognized and $20 billion, adjusted to take account of the time value of money, was charged to the income statement in 2010.
Other items Provisions at 31 December 2012 also include amounts in relation to completing the oil spill response, BPs commitment to a 10-year research programme in the Gulf of Mexico, the discounted cost of the agreement with the US government to settle all federal criminal charges, estimated penalties for liability under Clean Water Act Section 311 and estimated legal fees.
These are not covered by the trust fund.
The provision does not reflect any amounts in relation to fines and penalties except for those relating to the Clean Water Act, as it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amount or timing of such additional items.
BP also considers that it is not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to litigation other than as included within the settlement with the PSC as set forth in Note 36 and the settlement with the US government for federal criminal charges.
These items are therefore disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Further information on provisions is provided below and inNote 36.
Further information on contingent liabilities is provided in Note 43.
Provision movements A provision has been recognized for estimated future expenditure relating to the incident, for items that can be measured reliably at this time, in accordance with BPs accounting policy for provisions, as set out in Note 1.

Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill continued The total amount recognized as an increase in provisions during the year was $6,868 million, including $1,985 million for items covered by the trust fund and $4,883 million for other items 2011 $5,183 million, including $4,038 million for items covered by the trust fund and $1,145 million for other items.
In addition, $794 million was derecognized relating to items that will be covered by the trust fund but which can no longer be reliably estimated.
After deducting amounts utilized during the year totalling $5,864 million, including payments from the trust fund of $4,624 million and payments made directly by BP of $1,240 million 2011 $6,208 million, including payments from the trust fund of $3,707 million and payments made directly by BP of $2,501 million, and after reclassifications and adjustments for discounting, the remaining provision as at 31 December 2012 was $15,200 million 2011 $15,333 million.
Movements in the provision are presented in the table below.
$ million 2012 2011 2010 At 1 January 15,333 16,335 Increase in provision items not covered by the trust fund 4,883 1,145 17,694 items covered by the trust fund 1,985 4,038 12,567 a Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 794 Unwinding of discount 7 64 Reclassified to other payables 350 Change in discount rate 17 5 Utilization paid by BP 1,240 2,501 10,912 paid by the trust fund 4,624 3,707 3,023 At 31 December 15,200 15,333 16,335 Of which current 5,449 9,437 7,938 non-current 9,751 5,896 8,397 a Relates to items covered by the trust fund.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors.
Furthermore, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP including any determination of BPs culpability based on any findings of negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
The amount and timing of any amounts payable could also be impacted by any further settlements which may or may not occur.
Although the provision recognized is the current best reliable estimate of expenditures required to settle certain present obligations at the end of the reporting period, there are future expenditures for which it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably.
See Note 43 for further information.
 The group income statement for 2012 includes a pre-tax charge of $5,014 million 2011 pre-tax credit of $3,742 million in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
The amount charged to date comprises costs incurred up to 31 December 2012, settlements agreed with the co-owners of the Macondo well and other third parties, estimated obligations for future costs that can be estimated reliably at this time and rights and obligations relating to the trust fund.
Finance costs of $19 million 2011 $58 million reflect the unwinding of the discount on the trust fund liability and provisions.
The amount of the provision recognized during the year can be reconciled to the income statement amount as follows: $ million 2012 2011 2010 Net increase in provision 6,868 5,183 30,261 Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 794 Change in discount rate relating to provisions 17 5 Costs charged directly to the income statement 257 512 3,339 Trust fund liability discounted 19,580 Change in discounting relating to trust fund liability 43 240 Recognition of reimbursement asset, net 1,191 4,038 12,567 Settlements credited to the income statement 145 5,517 Profit loss before interest and taxation 4,995 3,800 40,858 Costs charged directly to the income statement relate to expenditure prior to the establishment of a provision at the end of the second quarter 2010 and ongoing operating costs of the GCRO.
