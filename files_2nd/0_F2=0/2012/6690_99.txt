Taxation continued c. Deferred tax The deferred tax included in the balance sheet is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Deferred tax liability Accelerated capital allowances 31.2 23.3 Intangible assets 2.3 3.5 Other temporary differences 2.8 1.5 Revaluation of land and buildings treated as deemed cost on conversion to IFRS 20.9 22.6 Deferred tax liability included in balance sheet 51.6 50.9 Deferred tax asset Retirement benefit obligations 7.3 20.0 Deferred tax asset included in balance sheet 7.3 20.0 The deferred tax included in the Group income statement is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Accelerated capital allowances 8.3 3.9 Tax losses 0.1 Retirement benefit obligations 3.1 0.8 Other temporary differences 0.3 4.9 11.1 7.9 Adjustments in respect of prior years 0.7 0.3 Adjustments in respect of opening deferred tax rate reduction 3.7 4.5 Total deferred tax expense credit 8.1 12.1 Deferred tax expense on discontinued operations 3.2 Deferred tax expense credit on continuing operations 8.1 15.3 The UK Government has announced its intention to reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 22% by 1 April 2014.
A reduction from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011 and was intended to be effective from 1 April 2012.
However, a further reduction to 24% was announced in the Budget on 21 March 2012 and substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and this rate came into effect on 1 April 2012 instead of the 25% rate.
A further reduction to 23% was enacted when the Finance Act 2012 received Royal Assent on 17 July 2012.
As the 23% rate had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date it has no effect on current or deferred tax liabilities in these accounts.
However, as the 24% rate was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, this rate has been applied to the deferred tax assets liabilities at the year end.
If the reduction to 22% had been enacted by 30 June 2012 the Groups deferred tax liability would have been reduced by a further 4.3m to 47.3m and the deferred tax asset would have been reduced by a further 0.6m to 6.7m.
