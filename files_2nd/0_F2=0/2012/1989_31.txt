In 2011 the restructuring costs related primarily to the closure of a German Healthcare plant.
This concluded the restructuring undertaken following the loss of a significant contract in 2010.
The tax credit on this was 0.9 million.
In 2011 the group incurred costs of 7.9 million associated with the implementation of its strategic review announced in November 2010.
This included 5.4 million of restructuring costs incurred in the Irish and Scandinavia flat linen businesses, which we are Managing for Value and in rationalising the salesforce in our Core Growth business.
This also included 2.5 million of costs in managing the change programmes identified in our Strategic review such as the capital efficiency and procurement review programmes.
The tax credit on these costs was 1.7 million.

There was a tax related charge of 0.4 million.
In 2011, the group recognised a 3.1 million credit for changes in the management and funding arrangements for long-term employee benefits.
This covered a number of countries and included the impact of closing to future accrual the UK defined benefit pension scheme.
The scheme was closed to new entrants in 2003 and by closing to future accrual the scheme is in line with standard UK practice.
There was a tax charge of 0.9 million.
During 2011 a net profit was realised on property disposals primarily in the UK.

These Business Lines are managed and controlled at the operating segment level and each of the operating segments has their own dedicated management team.
The internal group reporting structure was changed in January 2012 to align with the new Business Line structure.
Going forward, management will monitor goodwill at operating segment level and goodwill has been reallocated on this basis.
Goodwill that is specific to a particular operating segment has been included in the operating segment directly.
All other goodwill has been reallocated to the appropriate operating segments prospectively using the three-year average forecast operating cash flow for 2012 to 2014 as the basis for the relative value approach.
Under the new business line structure, we have 23 CGUs which represents the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates independent cash flow from other groups of assets.
In 2011, we had 17 CGUs under the previous geographical structure.
For the purpose of goodwill impairment review, acquired goodwill has been allocated to nine groups of CGUs being the operating segments.
The operating segments are Workwear, Facilities, UK Flat Linen, Scandinavian Flat Linen, Germany & Austria Healthcare, Ireland, Direct Sales, Clinical Solutions and Decontamination.
Berendsen plc Report and 112 Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 8 Goodwill continued For reporting purposes, the goodwill has been allocated to the operating segments as outlined below.
2011 has been re-presented based upon the new segmental reporting adopted for 2012.

An annual goodwill impairment test is then carried out by comparing the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of each operating segment is based on value-in-use calculations which management develop from forecast cash flows based on past performance, market data and its expectation of future market development.
These calculations require the use of estimates and the pre-tax cash flow projections are based on the groups current three-year strategic plan.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using an estimated growth rate of 2% and are appropriate because these are long-term businesses.
The growth rate of 2% does not exceed long-term GDP estimates for countries that the group operates within.
The main assumptions on which forecast cash flows have been based are revenue, operating margin and cash growth.
Projected cash flows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates of 11%.
The discount rates reflect market assumptions for the Risk Free-rates and Equity Risk Premiums and also take into account the net cost of debt.
The annual impairment testing carried out in the current year showed that the recoverable amount for all groups of CGUs to which goodwill is allocated exceeded the carrying amount of the groups of CGUs.
At the time of the reallocation of goodwill an impairment test was also carried out which showed that no impairment was required.
This year there are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions that would cause an impairment of goodwill.
Last year, we provided additional disclosures on the annual impairment testing results for Germany Healthcare and Clinical Solutions.
In 2012, Clinical Solutions has performed well ahead of last years plan and the latest forecast operating cash flow results reflect the current years positive results, resulting in an increase in headroom.
In 2012, Germany Healthcares operating cash flow results were also better than plan and the goodwill impairment review carried out at the time of reallocation indicated no impairment was necessary.

This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
In September 2008, a notional principal amount of SEK 300 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
The swap entered into has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The group has in issue US$509 million and 25 million long-term senior guarantee notes under private placements in the US.
In May 2006 the group placed US$250 million at fixed rates for periods between eight and twelve years and in December 2009 the group undertook a further placement of US$259 million and 25 million at fixed rates for periods between seven and twelve years.
In both placements the foreign currency amounts were immediately swapped into other currencies: Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
This is to offset the foreign exchange rate exposure arising on the groups foreign currency assets.
The conversion from US dollars into currency was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
All of these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges, with the exception of one swap from the 2006 placement, which has been designated as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross-currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
During the year in accordance with group policy, the group entered into several forward foreign exchange contracts for the purchase of US dollars in the future at fixed rates.
These forward contracts reduce the foreign exchange exposure on the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
Cash flow hedges The interest rate swaps have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 1.3 million.
At 31 December 2012 the fixed interest rates vary from 4.14% to 4.54%, the floating Danish krone rate being CIBOR and the floating Swedish krona rate being STIBOR.
The blended fixed rate for the group on these interest rate swaps amount is 4.3%.
Of the US$509 million private placements US$459 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placements which has been swapped varies from 4.92% to 5.97%.
The derivative asset recognised on five of these fifteen instruments is 14.5 million of which the currency component is a loss of 5.7 million with a loss of 1.6 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The derivative liability on the ten remaining instruments is 1.7 million of which the currency component is a loss of 7.4 million with 1.4 million taken to the hedging reserve.
The exchange component of this derivative movement has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 13.1 million loss.
The 3.0 million loss has been taken to the hedging reserve and will be continuously released to the income statement until the repayment of the private placement.
The forward foreign exchange contracts have resulted in the recognition of a derivative liability of 0.2 million 2011: asset of 0.1 million.
During the year a loss of 0.3 million 2011: gain of 1.2 million was recognised in equity.
This equity transfer will then be recognised in the income statement in line with the hedged transaction.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31 December 2012 the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.40% and 5.57% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies against CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.
The movement on the derivative liability arising has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 3.3 million profit.
The groups borrowings under its revolving credit facilities are designated as a hedge of its European operations.
The carrying value of the borrowings as at 31 December 2012 was 187.7 million 2011: 240.2 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 1.7 million on translation is taken to reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between one and two years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges US$50 million of the 2006 US private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective portion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 171,629 2011: profit 74,595.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 4.2 million derivative asset.
Berendsen plc Report and 122 Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 17 Financial risk management 17.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Chief Financial Officer identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment from Far East suppliers.
The group policy is to enter forward contracts to purchase US dollars based upon the expected purchases.
These derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges.
The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2012 and 2011, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31 December 2012 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 27.0 46.1 34.4 43.6 15.9 167.0 Bank overdrafts 64.2 27.4 1.7 93.3 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 37.2 18.7 34.4 43.6 14.2 73.7 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 72.0 53.5 316.8 44.4 43.2 529.9 Finance lease liabilities 2.8 4.1 0.6 7.5 Pre-derivative position 112.0 34.8 316.8 10.0 3.7 13.6 463.7 Derivative effect 0.2 202.7 316.8 47.1 65.2 1.6 Post-derivative position 112.2 237.5 57.1 68.9 13.6 462.1 As at 31 December 2011 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 34.6 48.4 20.9 22.3 10.2 136.4 Bank overdrafts 19.7 11.7 13.1 44.5 Net cash and cash equivalents note 13 14.9 36.7 20.9 22.3 2.9 91.9 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 117.8 49.6 332.6 45.1 52.1 597.2 Finance lease liabilities 4.6 0.1 3.2 0.4 8.3 Pre-derivative position 107.5 13.0 332.6 24.2 33.0 3.3 513.6 Derivative effect 0.1 202.9 332.6 56.4 58.9 14.5 Post-derivative position 107.4 215.9 80.6 91.9 3.3 499.1 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 16.
Berendsen plc Strategy and Business Corporate Financial Report and Overview performance line review Risk Our people responsibility Governance statements Accounts 2012 123 17.1 Financial risk factors continued ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities or commodities price risk.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2012 and 2011, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in sterling, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
As at 31 December 2012, the group has the following swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt: DKK 400 million and SEK 300 million.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 2.7 2.9 In more than one year, but not more than two years 35.1 3.1 In more than two years but not more than five years 83.4 121.0 In more than five years 228.5 238.3 349.7 365.3 Floating interest rate borrowings 187.7 240.2 Total borrowings 537.4 605.5 During 2012 and 2011, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31 December 2012 As at 31 December 2011 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 73.7 73.7 91.9 91.9 Borrowings 349.7 187.7 537.4 365.3 240.2 605.5 Pre-derivative net debt position 349.7 114.0 463.7 365.3 148.3 513.6 Derivative effect note i 43.9 45.7 1.8 79.4 93.8 14.4 Post-derivative net debt position 393.6 68.3 461.9 444.7 54.5 499.2 i Excludes the forward foreign exchange contract derivatives.
b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 245.8 million 2011: 272.9 million.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
Berendsen plc Report and 124 Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 17.1 Financial risk factors continued c Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed in the operating entities of the group and is aggregated by group finance.
Group finance monitors rolling forecasts of the groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities note 15 at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.
Such forecasting takes into consideration the groups debt financing plans, covenant compliance, and compliance with internal balance sheet ratio targets.
The table below analyses the groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relative maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contract maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows using spot interest and foreign exchange rates at 31 December 2012.
Balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of the discount is not significant.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
Berendsen plc Strategy and Business Corporate Financial Report and Overview performance line review Risk Our people responsibility Governance statements Accounts 2012 125 17.1 Financial risk factors continued The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: and changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.
The following table shows the groups exposure to foreign exchange risk as at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, which is a result of increase decrease of 10% movement in foreign exchange gains losses on translation of foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
The group continues to remain compliant with all its banking covenants.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
There was a triennial valuation in February 2010.
In 2012, 5 million 2011: 5 million was contributed to the fund, with a further 5 million planned in 2013.
Overseas, the only significant defined benefit pension arrangements are the defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the funded plans is 19.5 million of which 18.8 million surplus is in respect of the main UK plan.
There is a deficit of 40.0 million on unfunded plans.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31 December 2012 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2012 2011 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.8 2.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9 2.8 Discount rate 4.2 4.5 Inflation rate RPI 2.9 2.8 Inflation rate CPI 2.3 2.0 Expected return on plan assets Equities 7.9 7.9 Bonds 3.5 3.5 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.

The objectives of the fund are to hold a diversified basket of assets which is proactively changed to avoid the risks of a static portfolio.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
