Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive shares arise from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
There were no such share options in the current year 2011: 2.8 million.
Fully diluted earnings per share is used for the purposes of the Share Matching Plan and is based on total underlying profit and the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic earnings per share increased by the weighted average total employee share options outstanding during the period.
Underlying earnings per share is based on profit before the exceptional items described in Note 1.

As this exceeded carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised 2011: nil.
NEXT Sourcing The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.
In assessing value in use, the most recent financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 10% 2011: 10%.
Lipsy In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the five year business plan for Lipsy was used and cash flows beyond this period extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% 2011: 2%, and discounted at 15% 2011: 15%.
The key assumption is the net contribution margin of retail and internet sales.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there is no impairment at January 2012.

Holders of the Companys 2013 and 2016 bonds were invited to tender their holdings, either for cash or in exchange for the new 10-year issue.

The 2016 bond redemption has been treated as a modification, rather than as a debt extinguishment and, accordingly, the redemption premium of 3.1m has been capitalised.
Consideration received is stated net of transaction fees of 2m.
Of the 2013 bonds that were redeemed in the year, 74.2m were exchanged for the new 2021 issue and 46.6m were redeemed for cash.
All 37.4m of the redeemed 2016 bonds were exchanged for new 2021 bonds.
The transactions were settled on a net basis.
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to manage the interest rate risk associated with its bonds.
After accounting for fees and gains on interest rate swaps, which partly offset the premiums paid on redemption, the transactions resulted in a net 1.5m charge to finance costs.

Retirement benefit plans The Group operates a pension plan in the UK which consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and, prior to 1 October 2006, annual performance bonuses.
From 1 October 2006, sales and profit related bonuses ceased to be part of pensionable earnings.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members from October 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined after September 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The plan has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex and complies with the Employment Equality Regulations 2006.
The assets of the plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Group also provides further, unfunded retirement benefits to plan members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the lifetime allowance.
In 2010, as part of the Groups risk management strategy for the liabilities arising under the Plan, most pensioner liabilities were subject to a buy-in arrangement.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the Plan paid 124m to an insurance company and receives annuity payments equal to the monthly pensions then in payment.
This eliminates the Plans exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these pensioner members.

Retirement benefit plans continued The IAS 19 valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent qualified actuary as at 28 January 2012 using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: 2012 2011 Discount rate 5.00% 5.70% Salary increases 3.10% 3.60% Inflation RPI 3.10% 3.60% Inflation CPI 2.10% 2.90% Pension increases 3.10% 3.60% Expected rate of return on assets Equities 6.95% 7.70% Bonds 3.95% 4.85% Gilts 2.65% 4.15% Property 5.55% 6.25% Insurance contract 5.00% 5.70% Other 2.65% 4.25% Average 5.18% 6.34% Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 male 22.5 22.3 Pensioner aged 65 female 24.9 24.7 Non-pensioner aged 40 male 25.3 25.2 Non-pensioner aged 40 female 27.7 27.6 Expected rates of return on plan assets are based on external historical and forecast market information, and actual rates will most likely vary from those shown above.
The key sensitivity in the calculation is the discount rate applied.
A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would result in an increase in gross scheme liabilities of approximately 59m, although this would be partly mitigated by an increase of approximately 7m on the buy-in insurance asset.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the rate of 17.5%.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit sections financial position was undertaken as at 31 March 2010.
Adjusting these results for the subsequent buy-in transaction described above resulted in a fully funded position on an actuarial basis.
The Company and the Trustees of the Plan have agreed that no further special contributions are required.
Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, which is matched by the Company.
Total employer contributions of 13.1m 2011: 54.3m were made during the year, including 4.2m 2011: 4.1m in respect of the defined contribution section.
Employer contributions in the previous year also included 40.0m in respect of the buy-in.

Equity settled share based payments continued fair value calculation The fair value of management, sharesave and share matching plan options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a BlackScholes option pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.
The expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises.

30. financial instruments: risk management NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of its businesses.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.
Foreign currency risk The Groups principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 18 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.
This hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and manage the Groups ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas assets or liabilities and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are detailed in the table below.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currencies, taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 34. assets liabilities 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m US Dollar 12.1 2.8 1.8 7.9 Euro 0.4 1.3 0.8 Credit risk Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.
Concentrations of risk are mitigated by the use of various counterparties at any one time.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base being large and diverse.
The Groups outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 16.

indd 82 10 04 2012 10:17:38 30. financial instruments: risk management continued Capital risk The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 35, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends.
Share buybacks are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share purchases.
31. financial instruments: hedging activities Foreign currency: cash flow hedges The Group uses derivative instruments in order to manage foreign currency exchange risk arising on expected future purchases of overseas sourced products for up to 18 months ahead.
These comprise forward currency contracts and currency options, the terms of which match the terms of the expected purchases.
Fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 11.5 3.2 Other foreign exchange derivatives 1.6 0.6 Total foreign exchange derivatives 9.9 3.8 The total notional amount outstanding at the balance sheet date is as follows: 2012 2011 m m US Dollar 727.5 573.8 Euro 90.3 77.6 Other 4.6 817.8 656.0 Interest rates: fair value hedges The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys corporate bonds.
Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 22.
The fair values of the Groups interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 31.4 17.4 Other interest rate derivatives 8.8 3.1 Total interest rate derivatives 40.2 20.5 Other interest rate derivatives relate to economic hedges of variable rate interest payments due under swaps relating to the 2013 corporate bond which are not able to be hedge accounted for under IAS 39.
The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.

33. financial instruments: fair values The fair values of each category of the Groups financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the Groups balance sheet, other than as noted below: 2012 2011 Carrying Carrying amount fair value amount Fair value m m m m Corporate bonds In hedging relationships 339.5 328.5 271.2 275.2 Not in hedging relationships 312.6 336.0 200.0 214.3 652.1 664.5 471.2 489.5 The fair values of corporate bonds are their market values at the balance sheet date.
Market values include credit risk and are therefore different to the reported carrying value of bonds in fair value hedging relationships, which adjusts the nominal value of the bond for changes in interest rate risk only.
Corporate bonds not in hedging relationships are carried at unadjusted amortised cost.
34. financial instruments: sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 10% 2011: 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% 2011: 0.5% increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.
The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 2011: 0.5% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions: For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
