Remuneration is significantly geared towards performance-oriented pay, with particular emphasis on long-term performance.
For example, at median performance approximately 54 per cent of the CEOs remuneration package is delivered through variable components, rising to approximately 90 per cent at stretch performance.
The maximum value is delivered only if upper quartile TSR is delivered against sector peers over six years, with a requirement for upper decile performance in the last three years.
The charts also include the actual remuneration delivered to the executive directors in respect of performance for 2012, for comparison.

The Committee will continue to review salaries annually to ensure they remain appropriate, particularly given the current highly competitive talent market in this sector and the fact that it is critical to the companys future success that we retain key talent.
The Committee sets yearly targets on the basis of a balanced scorecard comprising KPIs and other corporate objectives.
Payout is determined with reference to the balanced scorecard after careful assessment by the Committee and subject to the Committees discretion based on a broader assessment of overall company performance.
Bonuses for executive directors are subject to a maximum of 100 per cent of base salary.
For executive directors and other senior management, any annual bonus earned above 50 per cent of salary is deferred in shares for three years.
Deferred bonus shares remain subject to a bad leaver provision.
Annual bonus awards are subject to a claw-back provision in the event of a material misstatement of the companys financial results, gross misconduct or error in the calculation of performance conditions.
2012 annual bonus outcome In assessing 2012 performance, the Committee has taken into account the various measures of the five criteria below, against specific targets.
Targets were set at the beginning of 2012 and designed to be stretching but achievable.
The exact targets are not disclosed for reasons of commercial sensitivity, however performance in relation to threshold, base and stretch levels is detailed: Performance achievement Between Below threshold Between base At or above Metric Measures threshold and base and stretch stretch Health, Safety, Environment Group Total Recordable Injury and Security HSES Rate TRIR 3 Production Daily average mboepd 3 Exit rate mboepd 3 Final Investment Decisions FIDs approved in year 3 Exploration Risked prospective resources added mmboe 3 Finding costs for 2C 2P resource adds $ boe 3 Reserves replacement 3 Finance Net operating cash flow 3 Business development Strategic acquisitions 3 In addition to the achievement against specific targets, the Committee considered the wider overall company performance and awarded annual bonuses of 45 per cent of salary to the executive directors.
The 2013 annual bonus structure is broadly similar to that used for 2012, but with NAV growth now included.
In addition, a new element based on personal objectives will be included, with a 20 per cent weighting.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP All employees participate in the companys LTIP, approved by shareholders at the 2009 AGM, thereby encouraging a focus throughout the company on longer-term performance and alignment with shareholders.
The LTIP is structured to reinforce the delivery of strong share price growth and relative stock market out-performance over the long-term.
Performance is assessed over a minimum of three years, and over six years including the matching scheme.
Vesting is based on a combination of the absolute change in the companys equity value per share and the companys relative Total Shareholder Return TSR i. e. share price plus dividends performance against peers.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the choice of performance measures and in particular, the sensitivity of TSR to changes in oil price.
The Committee concluded that TSR remains an appropriate performance measure as it rewards the delivery of the companys strategy and also aligns managements interests with those of shareholders.
Absolute TSR captures the absolute return delivered to shareholders and relative TSR measures performance on a relative basis, thereby helping to negate the impact of uncontrollable factors such as oil price movements on the reward delivered through the LTIP.
64 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements REMUNERATION REPORT continued Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP continued To optimise the link between reward and performance, the plan allows the Committee certain discretions on determining the outcome of the LTIP.
Based on its assessment of the companys underlying financial and operational performance, the Committee may: reduce the size of the equity pool: allow for the equity pool to be fully funded when growth in equity value exceeds 20 per cent p. a. : lift the cap of 100 per cent of salary under the equity pool: decide whether or not to grant matching shares: and reduce the level of vesting for performance shares and matching shares.
In assessing the underlying performance of the company the Committee has previously considered performance against the five metrics noted below, which are specified in the plan.
As a result of the review undertaken in 2012, the Committee has broadened the inputs used to determine whether the TSR performance is reflective of the companys underlying financial and operational performance and from 2013 will also consider other measures, such as Net Asset Value per share, finding and development costs per barrel, delivery of the strategy and relative TSR.
Underpin measures Return on invested capital Reserves replacement Operating cash flow Earnings per share growth Health and safety record Further, all LTIP awards are subject to claw-back in the event of a material misstatement of the companys financial results, gross misconduct or material error in the calculation of the performance conditions.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards: vest after a three-year performance period and are based on a share of a pool which is subject to annualised growth in the companys equity value per share: the vested award is delivered in shares and 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a further three years.
Performance Share Awards: vest after a three-year performance period based on the companys TSR relative to a comparator group of international oil and gas companies: 50 per cent of the vested award is deferred for a further three years.
Matching Awards: Deferred Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards are eligible for a Matching Award of up to 2.5 times the number of shares deferred, vesting after a further three years, based on the companys TSR relative to a comparator group of international oil and gas companies.
LTIP Performance Share cycle Performance period Deferral period Award 50% of vested Balance is released award is released 3.
LTIP Matching Share cycle Performance period Award Vested award is released For participants below senior management, the deferral period is restricted to six months, unless the employee elects to extend the deferral period to three years in return for a grant of an LTIP Matching Award.
The structure of each element of the 2012 LTIP is described in more detail below and it is the Committees intention that awards granted in 2013 will also be based on this structure.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 65 Equity Pool Award The value of the LTIP Equity Pool is based on the growth in the companys equity value per share over the performance period see below.
If the companys compound annualised growth is equal to 10 per cent per annum, one per cent of the growth will be credited to the LTIP Equity Pool.
For growth of 20 per cent per annum or more, 2.5 per cent of the growth will be credited.
For growth of more than 10 per cent but less than 20 per cent, between one per cent and 2.5 per cent of the growth will be credited on a straight-line basis.
All employees are eligible to participate in the LTIP Equity Pool.
The value of an entitlement is calculated at the end of the performance period and is delivered in shares.
Allocations awarded under the 2012 LTIP Equity Pool are detailed on page 75.

The oil sector comparators have been selected on the basis of their similarity to Premier with regard to several factors, including business mix and geographic location, and are detailed on page 66.
Matching Award For executive directors and senior management, 50 per cent of the shares vesting from the LTIP Equity Pool Award and LTIP Performance Share Award are subject to compulsory deferral over three years and, subject to the Committees discretion, are eligible for a potential match of up to 2.5 : 1 dependent on the TSR performance of the company against the same comparator group used for coterminous LTIP Performance Share Awards as detailed on page 66.

As a result, awards under the 2010 Equity Pool will not vest as the threshold was not met: 2010 LTIP Performance Share cycle: over the performance period the companys TSR relative to its peers was between the median and upper quartile, warranting vesting of 89.9 per cent: and 2010 Matching Award cycle matched over deferred shares granted in 2010 under the AEP 2007 award : over the performance period the companys TSR relative to its peers was between the median and upper quartile, warranting a matching ratio of 1.64 : 1.
The Committee is satisfied that the recorded TSR is reflective of the underlying performance of the company.
In assessing the underlying performance of the company the Committee took into account, amongst other factors, the companys earnings per share growth, cash flow, return on invested capital, reserve replacement and health and safety record as shown below.

For the executive directors, 50 per cent of the PSA will be released immediately on vesting, with the remaining 50 per cent deferred for three years.
The LTIP Matching Shares will be released immediately on vesting.
