com Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Alent plc the Company is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group are set out on pages 4 to 11 and its registered address is Forsyth Road, Sheerwater, Woking GU21 5RZ.
BASIS OF PREPARATION 2.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The consolidated financial statements of Alent plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS.
2.2 GROUP REORGANISATION AND DEMERGER The Performance Materials division was demerged from Vesuvius plc with effect from 19 December 2012 and the entities making up the Performance Materials division were transferred to a new parent company, Alent plc.
Application was made to the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the issued share capital of Alent plc to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities as from 19 December 2012.
The demerger was effected by a three part transaction as follows: The entire share capital of Cookson Group plc was cancelled and shareholders were given one ordinary share in Vesuvius plc for every share in Cookson Group plc held: The entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited, the holding company of the companies making up the Performance Materials division was transferred to Alent plc: In return for the share capital of Alent Investments Limited, Alent plc allotted and issued to Vesuvius plc shareholders one Alent share credited as fully paid for each Vesuvius plc share held at 19 December 2012.
Although Alent plc acquired the entire share capital of Alent Investments Limited, it did not have the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Performance Materials division.
For that reason, the acquisition has been accounted for in accordance with the principles of reverse acquisition accounting as set out in IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
For the purposes of these consolidated financial statements, this had the effect of the legal acquirer, Alent plc, being treated as having been acquired by its legal subsidiary, Alent Investments Limited.
The impact of adopting this reverse acquisition accounting basis is set out in each applicable note to these consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared as if the continuing operations of the Group were in existence for the whole of the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2012.
2.3 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
84 Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED 2.4 FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IFRSs These are the Groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRSs and IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, has been applied with a transition date of 1 January 2011.
Since no consolidated financial statements were previously prepared for Alent plc, no reconciliations to previous GAAP have been presented.
In applying IFRS 1, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption from recording cumulative translation differences and hedging differences that existed at the transition date.
2.5 GOING CONCERN As discussed in more detail in the Directors Report on page 70, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they have adopted the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
2.6 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 26.1.
2.7 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed, encourages disclosure of additional line items where such presentation will assist in understanding financial performance and requires separate disclosure of material items of income or expense.
Accordingly, the Company discloses exceptional items separately on the face of its Group income statement, together with a full explanation of the nature and function of such items in the notes to the financial statements.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the item are considered in deciding whether an item warrants treatment as an exceptional item.
Such items may include, inter alia, the financial effect of major restructuring activity, profits or losses relating to current and non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, profits or losses arising on business disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Groups results either due to their size or nature.
2.8 NEW AND REVISED IFRS During the year a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
A number of other new and amended IFRS were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2013, none of which are likely to have a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 GOODWILL The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 2012, further details of which are given in note 18, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill.
STOCK CODE: ALNT 85 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS www.
com Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 3.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED 3.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to current and former employees.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
The assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuary, and whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the Groups profit and financial position.
3.3 LIABILITY RESERVES Alent has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4 TAXATION a Current tax Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based upon the Directors interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If operating or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its businesses.
4.1 NET SALES VALUE Net sales value is calculated as revenue, excluding the amount included therein related to commodity metals.
4.2 RETURN ON SALES AND RETURN ON NET SALES VALUE Return on sales is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by revenue.
Return on net sales value is calculated as adjusted operating profit divided by net sales value.
86 Annual report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 4.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTINUED 4.3 UNDERLYING REVENUE Underlying revenue is calculated as net sales value adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates and business acquisitions, disposals and closures.
4.4 ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT Adjusted operating profit is operating profit as reported in the Group income statement before the share of post-tax profits of joint ventures, exceptional items, demerger costs and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18.
4.5 ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX Adjusted profit before tax is profit before tax as reported in the Group income statement before exceptional items, demerger costs and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18.
4.6 ADJUSTED PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Adjusted profit for the year is profit for the year as reported in the Group income statement, before exceptional items, demerger costs, exceptional tax and including the effects of proforma adjustments as described on page 18.
4.7 ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE Adjusted earnings per share is based upon adjusted profit for the year.
4.8 ADJUSTED CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS Adjusted cash generated from operations is cash generated from operations as reported in the Group statement of cash flows after adding back 21.7m 2011: nil of Woking restructuring note 8 and demerger cash costs note 9.
4.9 FREE CASH FLOW Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment and dividends from joint ventures but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
4.10 AVERAGE WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES RATIO The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the year.
Average working capital comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months.
4.11 EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of operating profit before share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, exceptional items and depreciation charges.
4.12 NET INTEREST Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be exceptional.
4.13 INTEREST COVER Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
4.14 NET DEBT Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
4.15 NET DEBT TO EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTINUED 4.16 RETURN ON NET ASSETS Return on net assets RONA is calculated as adjusted operating profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.
4.17 RETURN ON INVESTMENT Return on investment ROI is calculated as adjusted operating profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by invested capital being total equity plus net debt, net employee benefits liabilities and goodwill previously written off to, or amortised against, reserves.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which can be found in note 4.
5.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
Sale of goods Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Construction contracts Where the outcome of a contractual arrangement, such as an equipment construction contract, can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised as performance occurs by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
b Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
5.2 BUSINESS SEGMENTS For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments, namely Assembly Materials and Surface Chemistries.
It is the Alent Board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments.
The information used by the Board to review performance and determine resource allocation is presented with the Groups activities analysed between these two business segments.
Taking into account the basis on which the Groups activities are reported to the Alent Board and the nature of the products and services within each of these business segments, the Directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Groups results.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Business Unit Review on pages 16 to 17.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material and segment result is operating profit before share of joint ventures and exceptional items and before corporate costs directly related to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below.
Segment result includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

INCOME TAX 11.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly to equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2012, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.

Accordingly, Alents weighted average share capital has been calculated by reference to movements in the number of issued ordinary shares of Cookson Group plc for the period from 1 January 2011 to 19 December 2012 and by reference to movements in the number of issued ordinary shares of Alent plc with effect from 19 December 2012.
For the purposes of calculating diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to the Companys share-based payment plans.
Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
Other than the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had no other outstanding options or share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 16.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is therefore not charged on construction in progress.
Depreciation is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between 10 and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years other between 5 and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year-end.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
As described in note 18.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing the sales proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets comprise goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations.
17.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.

For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has two CGUs: the Assembly Materials and Surface Chemistries businesses.
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.

IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 18.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these CGUs.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period.
The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
18.2 KEY ASSUMPTIONS The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, return on net sales value, growth rates and discount rates.
Return on sales and return on net sales value assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key end-markets of electronics and automotive: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each CGU operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2011: 2.5%: 2010: 3.0% has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Groups end-markets and external forecasts.
The Groups projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Assembly Materials CGU was 13.8% 2011: 13.8%: 2010: 12.5% and for the Surface Chemistries CGU 14.0% 2011: 15.0%: 2010: 14.1%.
18.3 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2012, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2012.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 19.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.

Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

All of the provision for impairment of trade receivables at 31 December 2012 of 4.2m 2011: 4.2m related to balances that were impaired on an individual basis.
Due to the large number of customers that the Group transacts its business with, none of which represent a significant proportion of the total outstanding trade receivables balance, the Group is not exposed to any significant concentration of credit risk.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Groups trade and other receivable balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.

INVENTORIES 20.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

As at 31 December 2012, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held 13.8m 2011: 10.6m of precious metals on consignment terms.
Alent has entered into precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities the Consignors.
The metal which the Group uses in the manufacture of its finished products for customers may be purchased from a Consignor and sold concurrently to the customer as of the same metals valuation date.
In addition, customers may supply metal which will be toll manufactured by the Group.
In the later case, the Group will only invoice customers for the value-added fabrication services.
As the Consignors retain title and associated risks and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the balance sheet.
Consequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in the Group balance sheet.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in note 26.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement.
Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within operating profit in the Group income statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY CONTINUED Cash ow hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within operating profit.
When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within operating profit in the income statement.

Alent plc applied merger relief under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 to this transaction and, accordingly, the excess of the total market value of Alent Investments Limited, being 862.4m, over the nominal value of the shares issued of 417.7m has been recorded in the other capital reserve.
Other reserve The other reserve in the table above arose as a result of applying reverse acquisition accounting following the demerger of the Alent Group from Cookson Group plc, and represents the difference between the capital reserves of the legal acquirer of the Alent Group, Alent plc, and those of the legal acquiree, Alent Investments Limited note 2.2.
Translation reserve The translation reserve in the table above comprises all foreign exchange differences attributable to the owners of the parent.
These exchange differences arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations and from the translation of financial instruments that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 26.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: ii Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement: and iii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pounds sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specic transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used: and iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassied to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 26.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Groups financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency profile of the Groups borrowings and financial assets is shown in the table below.

The financial assets attract floating rate interest at various rates.
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 1.4m 2011: decrease 0.5m and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 1.4m 2011: increase 0.5m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of nil 2011: nil in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of nil 2011: nil in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
The level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 300m 2011: nil, of which 72.5m 2011: nil were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in September 2017.
The maturity analysis of the Groups gross borrowings is shown in the tables below.

Following the demerger from Cookson Group plc in December 2012, the mix of the Groups capital has changed considerably, while the overall amount of capital has remained relatively constant.
At 31 December 2011, prior to the demerger, the Groups capital amounted to 403.2m, comprising 454.7m of equity balances and 51.5m of net cash.
As at 31 December 2012, the Groups capital had increased to 420.4m, comprising 276.0m of equity balances and 144.4m of net debt.
The reduction in equity balances and the increase in net debt since 31 December 2011, respectively reflect a the net capital contributions made to Vesuvius during the year and b the impact of the apportionment of Cookson Group plcs net debt between Alent and Vesuvius as part of the demerger process.
The Group monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios, RONA and ROI note 4.
The Groups objectives when managing its capital are: to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities: to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt: to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns: and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants and has substantial liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial Review on page 22.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 27.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups defined benefits plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The expense for the Groups defined benefits plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 27.7.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of profit from operations.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 27.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefits and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19. a Dened benets pension plans The Groups principal defined benefits pension plans are in the US.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefits pension plans in other territories but these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Groups US defined benefit plans are closed to new members and to future benefit accrual for existing members.
The main US plan, the Retirement Security Plan, has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans, but with a minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members accounts.
The cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 27.3 b refers to this minimum return.
The Groups US defined benefits plans provide retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
Actuarial valuations of the US plan are carried out each year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2011.
At that date, the market value of the plan assets was 42.8m, representing a funding level of 73% of funded accrued plan benefits using the projected unit method of valuation of 58.9m.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
b Dened contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 5.6m 2011: 5.3m and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
27.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefits pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups US defined benefits pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
The assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected 64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA.
2012 2011 Life expectancy of US pension plans members years years Age to which current pensioners are expected to live Men 84.6 84.6 Women 86.9 86.9 Age to which future pensioners are expected to live Men 86.6 86.6 Women 89.1 89.1 b Other principal US pension plans actuarial valuation assumptions 2012 2011 % p. a.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 27.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION CONTINUED The discount rate used to determine the liabilities of the US plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes is required to be determined by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds.
The US discount rate in the above table is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve.
The expected asset return is the Companys expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns: based on the riskfree yield available by following a buy and hold investment strategy in government bonds: with returns for other bonds and equities estimated based on observed historic long-term strategic risk premia.
These assumptions do not take account of the relative valuation of markets or of market momentum.
c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups US pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on US plan liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 1.3% Mortality Increase by one year Increase by 3.6% 27.4 DEFINED BENEFITS OBLIGATION The liabilities of the Groups defined benefits pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS 19 accounting purposes are measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefitrelated earnings.
The average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Groups US pension plans relate is 12 years.

Administration costs charged within ordinary finance costs in 2012 were 0.2m.
In accordance with IAS 19 Revised, which takes effect from 1 January 2013, these costs would have been charged within operating profit and the net finance charge relating to the Groups post-retirement benefit plans would have increased by 0.7m, resulting in an overall increase in the net finance charge of 0.5m.
The implementation of the revised standard is expected to increase the net finance charge for pensions in 2013 by some 0.5m.

LEASES 30.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
30.2 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS 2012 2011 m m The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: Not later than one year 5.9 7.2 Later than one year and not later than five years 13.5 20.6 Later than five years 2.7 35.5 Total operating lease commitments 22.1 63.3 The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 was not material.
The majority of the decrease in the level of lease commitments in 2012 arose as a result of the purchase of Alents property in Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within operating profit, amounted to 7.2m 2011: 7.7m.
PROVISIONS 31.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors best estimate of the costs to be incurred in the fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure and the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Provisions for restructuring and other charges include the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
Cash costs of 19.9m were incurred in the year ended 31 December 2012, of which 16.0m related to the purchase of Alents property in Woking, UK which was previously occupied on a leasehold basis and over which an onerous lease reserve had been established in 2009.
The purchase of the property resulted in the extinguishing of that provision.
The balance of 4.7m as at 31 December 2012 includes 1.7m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between two and sixteen years, and 3.0m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES NET OF CASH ACQUIRED During the year, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries for a total consideration of 3.2m, of which 0.4m was paid in cash and 2.8m being contingent upon future performance, 0.8m of which was paid in the current period.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 0.4m of which nil was cash.
Goodwill arising on these acquisitions amounted to 2.8m note 17.
The 1.4m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries net of cash acquired, comprised 0.4m paid for current year acquisitions, 0.2m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions and 0.8m of deferred consideration paid in respect of current year acquisitions.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors include: inventory held either under precious metal consignment arrangements note 20 : future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases note 30 : and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group balance sheet included 2.9m 2011: 13.2m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2012, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 0.1m 2011: 0.4m.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Certain subsidiary companies of Vesuvius plc and Alent plc are defendants in two actions, brought by MacDermid incorporated in the United States, which are pending in the Connecticut Superior Court and arising out of corporate activity involving the parties in the autumn of 2006.
The first action was commenced in 2009 and the second action was commenced in August 2012.
MacDermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive or exemplary damages, costs and interest which are currently unquantifiable.
Both Vesuvius and Alent believe these claims have no merit and are vigorously defending these actions.
Each of Vesuvius and Alent anticipate filing motions for summary judgement in both cases by mid-2013 and, if any claims remain pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in the second half of 2013 or early 2014.
Any liability relating to the MacDermid claim arising following the demerger of Cookson Group will be split equally between Alent plc and Vesuvius plc.
