Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 44 Annual report and accounts 2012 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation Subsidiary undertakings are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2011 and 30 April 2012.
The results of a new subsidiary undertaking are included from the date of its acquisition.
Where an entity has ceased to be a subsidiary undertaking during the year, its results are included to the date of cessation.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary undertaking are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of non-controlling interests is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently any losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the amount of non-controlling interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the accounts of subsidiary undertakings to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue recognition Group revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of the hire of vehicles, sale of used vehicles and the supply of related goods and services in the normal course of business, net of value added tax and discounts.
Revenue from vehicle hire is recognised evenly over the hire period and revenue from sales of other related goods and services is recognised at the point of sale.
Revenue from the sale of used vehicles is recognised at the point of sale.
Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and is the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses identified through annual or other tests for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets arising on business combinations Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Customer relationships 5 to 13 years Brand names 5 to 10 years Non-compete agreements 2 to 4 years Intangible assets other Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed three years.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Certain properties were revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS.
These valuations were treated as deemed cost at the time of adopting IFRS for the first time.
Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost of assets to residual values on a straight line basis over the assets useful estimated lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold buildings 50 years or over the life of the lease, whichever is shorter ]iiEw} 3 to 10 years 6iVivi 3 to 6 years iVi 3 to 6 years 6iVivi i`iiV i` }iL }`iiV i iviViVVivLiiiii `i ii`iiV rates have been determined with the anticipation that the net book values at the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the open market values for those vehicles.
Depreciation charges reflect adjustments made as a result of differences between expected and actual residual values of used vehicles, taking into account the further directly attributable costs to sell the vehicles.
Property under construction is not depreciated.
Depreciation commences when these assets are ready for their intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 45 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued On the subsequent sale or retirement of properties revalued prior to the adoption of IFRS, the attributable revaluation surplus remaining in the revaluation reserve is transferred directly to retained earnings.
The residual value, if not insignificant, is reassessed annually.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less selling costs and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis.
Where an impairment loss has been recognised in an earlier period, the Group reassesses whether there are any indications that such impairment has decreased or no longer exists.
If an impairment no longer exists, an impairment reversal is recognised in the income statement to the extent required.
Inventories Used vehicles held for resale are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Other inventories comprise spare parts and consumables and are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Current and deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the current or deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provision of the instrument.
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Any gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, where recognition of the resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the items being hedged.
The fair value of cross-currency and interest rate derivatives is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the derivative at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the derivative counterparties.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 46 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the income statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting for cash flow hedges is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement as a net profit or loss for the period.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Exchange differences arising on the net investment hedges are transferred to the translation reserve.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand.
Bank loans, other loan, loan notes and issue costs Bank loans, other loan and loan notes are stated at the amount of proceeds after deduction of issue costs, which are amortised over the period of the loan.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for in the income statement on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies other than UK Sterling are recorded at the rate prevailing at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward exchange contract.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
The net assets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into UK Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is recognised directly in equity.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated into UK Sterling using average exchange rates for the financial period and variances compared with the exchange rate at the balance sheet date are recognised directly in equity.
All other translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are recognised directly in equity, together with the exchange difference on the net investment in these enterprises.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity.
They are denominated in the functional currency of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, with any variances reflected directly in equity.
All foreign exchange differences reflected directly in equity are shown in the translation reserve component of equity.
Leasing and hire purchase commitments As Lessee: Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the future minimum lease payments and are depreciated over their useful economic lives using Group policies.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
As Lessor: iVi `iii`Vi`ii }i i iV`i`i] `ii VivVi i i to the income statement evenly over the period of the operating lease agreement.
Retirement benefit costs The Group predominantly operates defined contribution pension schemes but has one defined benefit scheme.
Contributions in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the income statement in the period they fall due.
Pension contributions in respect of one of these arrangements are held in trustee administered funds, independently of the Groups finances.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 47 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued Notes to the accounts continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The Group also operates group personal pension plans.
The costs of these plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Employee share schemes and share based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The Group issues equity-settled payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled employee schemes, including employee share options and deferred annual bonuses, provide employees with the option to acquire shares of the Company.
Employee share options and deferred annual bonuses are generally subject to performance or service conditions.
The fair value of equity-settled payments is measured at the date of grant and charged to the income statement over the period during which performance or service conditions are required to be met or immediately where no performance or service criteria exist.
The fair value of equity-settled payments granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of employee share options that vest, except where forfeiture is only due to market based performance criteria not being met.
The Group also operates a share incentive plan under which employees each have the option to purchase an amount of shares annually and receive an equivalent number of free shares.
The Group recognises the free shares as an expense evenly throughout the period over which the employees must remain in the employ of the Group in order to receive the free shares.
Interest income and finance costs Interest income and finance costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional gains or losses where they are considered by the Directors to be material and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the accounts are to be properly understood.
Dividends Dividends on Ordinary shares are recognised in the period in which they are either paid or formally approved, whichever is earlier.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Own shares The Group makes open market purchases of its own shares in order to satisfy the requirements of the Groups existing share schemes.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a reduction in shareholder equity.
The carrying values of own shares are compared to their market values at each reporting date and adjustments are made to write down the carrying value of own shares when, in the opinion of the Directors, there is a significant market value reduction.
Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 2, the Directors have made the following judgments that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the accounts.
Depreciation 6iVivi i`iiV i` }iL }`iiV i iviViVVivLiiiii `i ii`iiV rates have been determined with the anticipation that the net book values at the point the vehicles are transferred into inventories is in line with the open market values for those vehicles.
Under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Group is required to review its depreciation rates and estimated useful lives regularly to ensure that the net book value of disposals of tangible fixed assets are broadly equivalent to their market value.
Intangible assets Amortisation of intangible assets is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each intangible asset.
The Directors have made assumptions with regard to the evidence in the market, at the time of acquisitions, when determining these estimated useful lives.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 48 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets Determining whether goodwill and other non-current assets are impaired or whether the reversal of a previously recognised impairment is necessary requires an estimation of their value in use in the cash generating units.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from each cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts Trade receivables are stated in the balance sheet at their nominal value less any appropriate provision for irrecoverable amounts.
In determining whether provision is required against any trade receivable, judgment is required in estimating the likely levels of recovery.
In exercising this judgment, consideration is given to both the overall economic environment in which a debtor operates, as well as specific indicators that the recovery of the nominal balance may be in doubt, for example days sales outstanding in excess of agreed credit terms or other qualitative information in respect of a customer.
Taxation The Group carries out tax planning consistent with a Group of its size and makes appropriate provision, based on best estimates, until tax computations are agreed with the tax authorities.
To the extent that tax estimates result in the recognition of deferred tax assets, those assets are only carried in the balance sheet to the extent that it is considered that they are likely to be recovered in the short term.
In the current year, net deferred tax assets totalling Nil previously derecognised have been recognised as the recovery of those assets is now considered probable in the short term 2011 5,928,000, as explained further in Note 10.

Revenue from sale of vehicles is included as revenue in accordance with IAS 16 which requires used vehicle assets to be classified as inventories.
Used vehicle sales are included within UK and Spain operating segments, which reflects the level at which the executive Board of Directors allocate resources and review performance of the Group.
There is no significant intersegment trading.
Geographical information Revenues are attributed to countries on the basis of the companys location.
The Directors consider the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to be a single geographical segment on the grounds that the results and net assets of operations in the Republic of Ireland are immaterial to the Group as a whole.
Segment assets and liabilities exclude derivative financial instrument assets and liabilities and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, since these balances are not included in the segments assets and liabilities as reviewed by the chief operating decision maker.

The underlying tax charge of 17,803,000 2011 15,305,000 excludes exceptional tax credits of 11,216,000 2011 16,818,000 as set out in Note 35, and tax credits on intangible amortisation of 1,068,000 2011 1,340,000.
There has been no recognition of deferred tax assets previously derecognised 2011 5,928,000.
On 1 April 2012 the UK Corporation tax rate changed from 26% to 24%.
Accordingly, the tax disclosures reflect deferred tax measured on the new 24% rate.
The rate is proposed to be reduced further to 23% by 1 April 2014.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the further 1% reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the deferred tax liabilities and assets of the Group and of the Company accordingly.

Result of the parent company A loss of 2,957,000 2011 18,384,000 is dealt with in the accounts of the Company.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 3 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an income statement for the Company alone.
Goodwill 2012 2011 Group 000 000 Carrying value: At 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2012 3,589 3,589 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has two cash generating units: the UK and Spain.
The Group tests its CGUs annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that assets might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
The Directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth rates forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
In addition to the annual test of impairment, and as required by IAS 36, there has also been an assessment as to whether there has been any indication that an impairment loss recognised in an earlier year has decreased or no longer exists.
The impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2012 using growth rates of 1% to 2% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 10.3% for the UK CGU and 11.7% for the Spanish CGU.
iiVi`i iV V i`L i`i ` `i }V v i}ii i`ii It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spanish CGU.
In the prior year, the impairment assessment was based on risk-adjusted cash flow forecasts derived from a two year business plan approved by the Directors in April 2011 using growth rates of 1% to 3% over a 10 year period, including terminal values, using a discount rate of 10% for the UK CGU and 10% for the Spanish CGU.
It was concluded that there were no indicators of additional impairment or reversal of impairment previously charged for both the UK CGU and Spanish CGU.
The impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the UK CGU and Spanish CGU.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible changes to the assumptions used for the UK CGU resulted in an additional impairment charge being required.
The Spanish CGU had headroom of 0.5m at the balance sheet date.
An increase in the discount rate of 0.02% would eliminate the headroom in the Spanish CGU.

Borrowings Borrowings comprise bank loans, loan notes, property loans, preference shares and other borrowings.
Except as detailed in Note 39, the Directors consider that the carrying amounts of the Groups borrowings approximate to their fair value.
Bank loans Bank loans are secured and bear interest at rates of 1.50% to 2.75% 2011 1.20% to 3.25% above the relevant interest rate index, being LIBOR for Sterling denominated debt and EURIBOR for Euro denominated debt.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 60 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued 22.
Borrowings continued Loan notes In 2006 and 2007, the Company issued unsecured loan notes to investors principally based in the United States.
The total of the loan notes the US Notes issued by the Group was US$357,000,000 and 21,000,000.
In addition, and in accordance with the terms of the US Notes, during the prior year, make-whole notes amounting to $7,530,000 and 456,000 were issued, all of which on their issue had a maturity of September 2012 and otherwise had the same terms as the related loan notes.
During the prior year, all make-whole notes were repaid in full.
These factors expose the Group to foreign currency exchange risk.
As explained in further detail in Note 23, the Group has entered into cross-currency swap financial instruments in order to mitigate this risk.
Both the weighted average fixed interest rate on the US Notes and the overall weighted average fixed interest rate taking into account the interest rates within the cross-currency swap instruments are shown in the table above.
Other loan The other loan is an eight year 100,000,000 secured term loan which is repayable in three equal instalments in October 2017, April 2018 and April 2019.
Interest is payable at 4.25% above LIBOR.
The loan is stated net of unamortised finance fees incurred in relation to entering into this loan agreement.
Cumulative Preference shares The cumulative Preference shares of 50p each entitle the holder to receive a cumulative preferential dividend at the rate of 5% on the paid up capital and the right to a return of capital at either winding up or a repayment of capital.
The cumulative Preference shares do not entitle the holders to any further or other participation in the profits or assets of the Company.
These shares have no voting rights other than in exceptional circumstances.
The total number of authorised cumulative Preference shares of 50p each is 1,300,000 2011 1,300,000, of which 1,000,000 2011 1,000,000 were allotted and fully paid at the balance sheet date.
Property loans All property loans relate to land and buildings held in Spain and are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
The loans are secured on the properties to which they relate.
The average remaining lease term is one year 2011 two years.
At 30 April 2012, the average borrowing rate for property loans was 2.8% 2011 2.1%.
All loans are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.

It is common practice in Spain for businesses to have a bank facility which enables their suppliers to be paid earlier than under normal credit terms.
When this is the case the supplier pays to Northgate Espaas bank a discount fee for early settlement.
When invoices fall due for payment, Northgate Espaa settles such invoices with its bank.
The Group pays no interest on confirming.
Total borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities at the balance sheet date, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, are as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Less than one year 3,946 14,135 In one year to five years 261,998 113,866 265,944 128,001 The total amount permitted to be borrowed by the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in terms of the Articles of Association shall not exceed six times the aggregate of the issued share capital of the Company and Group reserves, as defined in those Articles.
Analysis of consolidated net debt An analysis of movements in the Groups consolidated net debt is as follows: Other Foreign non-cash exchange At 30 April 2011 Cash ow changes movements 2012 000 000 000 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 96,885 87,062 116 9,707 Bank loans 360,974 217,050 4,443 19,085 129,282 Loan notes 161,718 4,457 147 3,888 161,002 Other loan 97,506 246 97,752 Cumulative Preference shares 500 500 Property loans and other borrowings 5,314 1,085 2,285 5 6,509 529,127 135,530 6,827 15,086 385,338 The Group calculates gearing to be net borrowings as a percentage of shareholders funds less goodwill and the net book value of intangible assets, where net borrowings comprise borrowings less cash at bank.
At 30 April 2012, the gearing of the Group amounted to 109.2% 2011 163.1% where net borrowings are 385,338,000 2011 529,127,000 and shareholders funds less goodwill and the net book value of intangible assets are 352,956,000 2011 324,361,000.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 62 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued 22.
Borrowings continued Financial instruments see also Note 39 Financial assets The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk associated with trade receivables in Spain is more concentrated in larger customers than the UK and, consequently, as in the UK the Group has a credit insurance policy in place to mitigate this risk.
Treasury policies and the management of risk The function of Group Treasury is to mitigate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably.
Treasury operations manage the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes only.
Consistent with Group policy, Group Treasury does not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using more complex financial instruments.
Further details regarding derivative financial instruments are shown in Note 23.
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only minimal exposures, with banks and other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to major credit rating agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed and which maintain an A rating.
Individual aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Financing and interest rate risk The Groups policy is to finance operating subsidiary undertakings by a combination of retained earnings, loan notes, other loans and bank borrowings, including medium term bank loans.
Cash at bank and on deposit yield interest based principally on interest rate indices applicable to periods of less than three months, those indices being LIBOR for Sterling denominated cash and EURIBOR for Euro denominated cash.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed through the use of interest rate derivatives as detailed in Note 23.
These derivatives are also used to manage the Groups desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the interest cost on outstanding debt.
At 30 April 2012, 96% 2011 71% of gross borrowings were at fixed or capped rates of interest, comprising 100,000,000 and 152,832,000 of interest rate swaps, $249,837,000 of US Dollar Sterling cross-currency swaps, 15,631,000 of Sterling denominated loan notes, 500,000 of preference shares and 5,647,000 of confirming facilities 2011 100,000,000 and 212,832,000 of interest rate swaps, $256,907,000 of US Dollar Sterling cross-currency swaps, 15,631,000 of Sterling denominated loan notes, 500,000 of preference shares and 3,362,000 of confirming facilities, as detailed in Note 23.
Foreign currency exchange risk The Group maintains borrowings in the same currency as its cash requirements, with the exception of borrowings maintained in Euro as net investment hedges against its Euro denominated investments Note 23 and with the exception of US Dollar denominated loan notes, as explained above.

U 59,000,000 of interest rate swaps due to commence in September 2012 with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 3.13% and a remaining weighted average life of 2.4 years were cancelled at a cash cost of 3,046,000 Notes 9 and 35.
This was in connection with a voluntary prepayment of the bank term debt: and U 38,000,000 of interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract receive rate of 1.13% matured.
As part of the debt refinancing undertaken by the Group in April 2011 the following interest rate derivative transactions occurred in the prior year: U 100,000,000 Sterling interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract pay rate of 3.62% and weighted average maturity of 10.0 years commenced: U 63,000,000 Sterling interest rate swaps were fide-designated from a relationship with the Sterling denominated term loan which was repaid in full.
On the date of fide-designation, these swaps had a weighted average remaining life of 1.4 years and the net amount deferred into equity at that date of 610,000 was expensed in the income statement Note 9.
On the same day, 63,000,000 Sterling interest rate swaps with a weighted average fixed contract receive rate of 1.13% and weighted average maturity of 1.4 years commenced: U 87,168,000 Euro interest rate swaps were closed out at a cash cost of 473,000.
At that time, these swaps were in a hedging relationship with the Euro term loan.
The notional amount closed out was the amount of Euro term loan which was repaid and cancelled on that date.
At that time, these swaps had a weighted average remaining life of 1.4 years and the net amount deferred into equity at that date of 473,000 was expensed in the income statement Note 9 : and U 152,832,000 of Euro interest rate swaps were entered into.

The amount recycled to the translation reserve represents the movement on the foreign exchange elements of the total fair value of the derivative subsequent to the designation of the Euro Sterling swap as a net investment hedge.
The net fair value remaining in the hedging reserve represents the fair value of the interest rate element of the derivatives Note 31.
Net investment hedges The Group manages its exposure to currency fluctuations on retranslation of the balance sheets of those subsidiary undertakings whose functional currency is in Euro by maintaining a proportion of its borrowings in the same currency.
In addition, the Group has entered into a number of Sterling Euro cross-currency swaps which are designated as net investment hedges.
The hedging objective is to reduce the risk of spot retranslation of the Euro subsidiaries from Euro to Sterling at each reporting date.
Exchange differences arising on the borrowings and net investment hedges have been recognised directly within equity along with the exchange differences on retranslation of the net assets of the Euro subsidiaries.
The hedges are considered highly effective in the current and prior year.

Retirement benefit schemes During the year the Group operated two group personal pension plans and The Willhire Pension Scheme the Scheme, which includes both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The total operating pension cost to the Group of all these arrangements was 1,407,000 2011 1,425,000 all of which related to the defined contribution schemes.
The Scheme The Scheme, which is established under Trust, is financed through separate trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
The Scheme is closed to both new members and to future service accrual for existing members.
Contributions to the Scheme are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent actuarial valuation of the fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed at 6 April 2010 by JLT Pension Capital Strategies.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method and the following principal assumptions set out below.

The cumulative net amount of actuarial losses reflected directly in equity since 3 February 2006 is 133,000 2011 94,000 gain.
The actual return on the scheme assets was a gain of 280,000 2011 235,000.
There are no reimbursement rights.
The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined retirement benefit scheme is as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Present value of dened benefit obligations 4,402 4,832 Fair value of Scheme assets 4,477 4,690 Asset liability recognised in the balance sheet 75 142 The asset recognised in the balance sheet is included within other debtors and prepayments Note 20.

The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on bonds.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long term relationship between each asset class and the bond returns and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
The analysis of the Scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2012 2012 2011 2011 Expected Fair value Expected Fair value return of assets return of assets % 000 % 000 Equity instruments 3.9 813 5.0 1,657 Debt instruments 1.9 3,530 3.0 2,782 Other 1.9 134 3.0 251 4,477 4,690 The Scheme assets do not comprise any of the Groups own financial instruments nor does the Group occupy any property or use any other assets held by the Scheme.

Financial instruments The following disclosures and analysis relate to the Groups financial instruments, as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 26 to 34.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters as discussed in Notes 22 and 23.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to movements in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling and US Dollars and Sterling, where Sterling is the functional currency of the Group.
As explained in more detail below and in Note 23, identical key terms between US Dollar denominated loan note liabilities and Sterling US Dollar cross-currency derivatives mean that the profit and loss and equity of the Group is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in the exchange rate between US Dollars and Sterling.
This means that the material sensitivity of the profit or loss and equity of the Group to exchange rate movements arises due to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Euro and Sterling only.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 0.10 2011 0.10 increase and decrease in the Euro Sterling exchange rate.
A 0.10 2011 0.10 movement in the rate in either direction is managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates in the near term.
The sensitivity analysis includes only any outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 0.10 2011 0.10 change in foreign currency rates.
As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 0.10 increase 0.10 decrease 2012 000 000 000 Total equity 366,136 363,577 369,146 As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 0.10 increase 0.10 decrease 2011 000 000 000 Total equity 339,759 336,891 343,190 There is no material impact on the income statement in either year.
Sterling US Dollar cross-currency derivatives As explained in Note 23, the Group has Sterling US Dollar cross-currency derivatives to manage its exposure to foreign exchange movements between US Dollars, the denomination of loan note liabilities, and Sterling, the functional currency of the Group.
The movement in fair value of these derivatives is a function of both the Sterling US Dollar exchange rate and market interest rates prevailing in the United Kingdom and United States.
As a result of the key terms of the cross-currency derivatives and the loan notes, against which a hedging relationship is designated, being identical, any gains or losses on foreign exchange included in the fair value of the Sterling US Dollar cross-currency swaps are transferred to the income statement and are exactly offset in the income statement by an equal and opposite amount on retranslation of the US dollar loan notes to the closing rate prevailing at the balance sheet date, leaving a net impact of Nil on the income statement for all Sterling US Dollar exchange rates.
The net impact on the hedging reserve, arising from these particular derivatives, therefore represents only the gain or loss on the interest rate element of the fair value of the derivatives, as explained further in Note 23.
Consequently, any fluctuation in the rate of the US Dollar has no impact on either profit and loss or equity.
Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk, as entities within the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap and collar contracts.
Hedging activities are reviewed regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 78 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued 39.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate liabilities and related derivatives.
For the floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared on the basis of both the average liability outstanding over the period and average rate applicable for the period.
In all instances it is assumed that any derivatives designated in hedging relationships are 100% effective.
A 1.0% 2011 1.0% increase or decrease has been used in the analyses and represents managements best estimate of a reasonably possible change in interest rate in the near term.
As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 1.0% increase 1.0% decrease 2012 000 000 000 profit before taxation 45,987 45,022 46,952 Total equity 366,136 365,421 366,850 As would be As would be As stated in stated if stated if annual report 1.0% increase 1.0% decrease 2011 000 000 000 profit before taxation 26,540 24,982 28,098 Total equity 339,759 338,638 340,880 Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date: Average contract Notional principal xed interest rate amount Fair value Outstanding receive oating pay 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 xed contracts % % 000 000 000 000 Sterling In less than one year 2.44% 25,000 152 In the second year 2.44% 63,000 610 After five years 3.62% 3.62% 100,000 100,000 12,251 2,336 Euro In less than one year 2.35% 152,832 894 In the second year 2.35% 212,832 2,455 In the third to fifth years inclusive 3.12% 76,416 3,036 Outstanding pay oating receive xed contracts Sterling In less than one year 1.13% 25,000 19 In the second year 1.13% 63,000 24 commencing September 2012 and maturing September 2014 Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long term funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 22 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Northgate plc Notes to the accounts 79 Annual report and accounts 2012 continued Notes to the accounts continued 39.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
All interest cash flows and the weighted average effective interest rate have been calculated using interest rate conditions prevailing at the balance sheet date.
It includes both liabilities and assets to illustrate how the cashflows are matched in each period.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross cash inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amounts disclosed have been determined by reference to the floating rates applicable at the balance sheet date, which have then been used to project future cash flows.
Financial instruments continued Fair value of financial instruments The Group is required to analyse financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: U Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: U Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and U Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All the financial instruments below are categorised as Level 2.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: U Derivative financial instruments are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates: and U The fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.
Except as detailed in the following table, the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values or, in the case of interest rate swaps and cross-currency derivatives, are held at fair value: Carrying amount Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Financial liabilities Loan notes 161,002 161,718 173,316 173,874 Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.

This enables the Group only to deal with creditworthy customers therefore reducing the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, approximately 1,688,000 2011 781,000 is due from the Groups largest customer.
There are no customers who represent more than five per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas in the UK and Spain.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 21,567,000 2011 17,072,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and mainly unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.
Included in the allowance for doubtful receivables are trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation of 260,000 2011 456,000.

Trade receivables Note 20, cash and cash equivalents and trade payables Note 21 are shown at amortised cost.
All other financial instruments are at fair value.
The Company has no trade receivables and no intercompany receivables past due date.

Balances with subsidiary undertakings at the balance sheet date are shown in Notes 20 and 21.
Remuneration of key management personnel In the current and prior year, the Directors of Northgate plc are determined to be the key management personnel of the Group.
There are other senior executives in the Group who are able to influence the Company in the achievement of its goals.
However, in the opinion of the Directors, only the Directors of the Company have significant authority for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group.
During the year, consultancy fees of 111,000 2011 Nil were paid by Northgate Espaa Renting Flexible S. A to JG Astrand.
The details of the consultancy are set out in the Corporate Governance report on pages 34 and 35.
In respect of the compensation of key management personnel, the short term employee benefits, post-employment pension benefits, termination benefits and details of share options granted are set out in the audited part of the Remuneration Report on pages 28 to 32.
The fair value charged to the income statement in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions with the Directors is 418,000 2011 251,000.
There are no other long term benefits accruing to key management personnel, other than as set out in the audited part of the Remuneration Report.
