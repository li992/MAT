The provisions for rehabilitation costs include estimates for the effect of ination and changes in estimates and have been discounted to their present value at 2.5% 2011: 2.5% per annum, being an estimate equivalent to the risk free rate determined with reference to US government bonds with maturity dates comparable to the estimated rehabilitation of the mines.
Limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali, Cte dIvoire and the DRC to govern the mines, so the directors have based the provisions for environmental rehabilitation on standards set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the groups estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
It makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
Current Life of Mine LOM plans envisage the expected outow to occur at the end of the LOM which is 2027 for Loulo, 2021 for Tongon, 2026 for Gounkoto, 2021 for Morila and 2031 for Kibali.
The Morila rehabilitation estimate at 31 December 2012 includes the impact of the approved tailings storage facility retreatment programme, where the retreated tailings will be disposed in the pit, reducing closure cost and the risk of closing the surface tailings storage facility.
