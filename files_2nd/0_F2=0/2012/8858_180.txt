The majority of the plans are defined benefit which require contributions to be made into separately administered funds and retirement benefits are based on factors such as employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Some of the plans are defined contribution, where the retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
The group also makes payments to employees personal pension plans.
The amount recognised as an expense for defined contribution plans was 6.9 million 2011 6.0 million.
The major defined benefit plans are pension plans and post-retirement medical plans in the UK and the US.
The UK pension plan is a career average salary plan with a final salary section which was closed to future accrual of benefits from 1st April 2010.
The US hourly pension plan is a fixed benefit plan based upon years of service.
The US salaried pension plan is a final salary plan.
Full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1st April 2009 for the UK pension plan and 30th June 2011 for the US pension plans and the valuations of all of the UK and US plans were updated to 31st March 2012 by qualified independent actuaries.

The current mortality assumptions for all major plans retain prudent allowance for future improvements in longevity and take account of experience.
The groups largest plan is in the UK and for the purposes of calculating that plans pension liabilities as at 31st March 2012, the group has used SAPS S1 mortality tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
In addition, to allow for future improvements in longevity, the CMI 2011 tables published by the Institute of Actuaries have been used, with an assumed long term rate of future annual mortality improvement of 1.25%.
The mortality tables used for the UK pension plan have been updated since 31st March 2011 following a mortality investigation.
Last year the group used PA92 mortality tables projected to calendar year 2009 as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members.
In addition, allowance for future improvements in longevity was made using the medium cohort projections with a 1% underpin.
The mortality tables used for the other larger plans were: US RP2000 projected to 2017 using Scale AA Netherlands AG Prognosetafel 2005-2050 with one year age set back Canada UP 94 generational including allowance for future mortality improvements Germany RT2005 G South Africa PA 90, rated down by two years The expected future lifetime of average members currently at age 65 and average members at age 65 in 25 years time i. e. members who are currently aged 40 years is respectively: Currently age 65 Age 65 in 25 years UK plan US plans UK plan US plans Male 22.0 18.0 24.2 18.0 Female 24.8 19.9 27.2 19.9
