Earnings per ordinary share Cents per share 2012 2011 2010 Basic earnings per share 60.86 135.93 19.81 Diluted earnings per share 60.45 134.29 19.81 Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes treasury shares and the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs and includes certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the number of shares that are potentially issuable in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease the loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
