ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COPPER estimates as at 31 December 2012 COPPER The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
Mine Life The extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
TCu total copper, ICu insoluble copper total copper less acid soluble copper, ASCu acid soluble copper.
208 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COPPER estimates as at 31 December 2012 1 Copper Reserves: A variable cut-off from 0.20% up to 0.50% CuT, ICu or ASCu is applied as cut-offs to determine Ore Reserves on operations.
2 Collahuasi: The increases in Ore Reserves is due to the completion of a drilling campaign at Rosario Oeste enabling conversion of additional Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.
Ujina also has additional Ore Reserves due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long term metal price and an updated geological model.
3 El Soldado Sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Ore Reserves is due to production and a change in the block modelling methodology to take into account a change in the mine design bench height offset by increases due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long term metal price and new drilling information.
4 Los Bronces Sulphide Dump Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is due to a combination of production, changes to the mine plan, a new classi cation methodology which resulted in re-allocation of probable reserves to inferred resources offset by an increase due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long term metal price.
5 Mantos Blancos Sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to an updated mine planning schedule offset by a small increase due to new information from within the pit.
6 Mantos Blancos Oxide Vat and Heap Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to transfer of material to the Dump Leaching process along with production.
7 Mantos Blancos Oxide Dump Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is primarily due to production along with transfer of material to the Vat Leach Process which is offset by Vat Leach Tailings which will now be put through the Dump Leach Process.
8 Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is due to production offset by conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves enabled by new drilling information.
9 Mantoverde Oxide Dump Leach : The decrease in Ore Reserves is due to production offset by an increase of Dump Material within the Montecristo, Quisco and Pto 62 areas as a result of continued drilling.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2012 at the following operations: El Soldado, Los Bronces, Mantos Blanco and Mantoverde.

1 Copper Resources: A test of reasonable eventual economic extraction is applied through consideration of an optimised pit shell.
Materials outside the optimised shell that have potential of eventual economic extraction via underground means are not included in the Mineral Resource statement.
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.2% TCu cut-off.
2 Collahuasi Sulphide and Low Grade Sulphide Flotation : The increase in Mineral Resources is primarily due to Economic Assumptions increase in long term metal price and new drilling information which identi ed and delineated new resources.
3 El Soldado Sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Mineral Resources is primarily due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves increase in long term metal price and greater dilution effect as a result of a change in bench height and ore waste contact modelling methodology.
4 Los Bronces Sulphide Flotation : The decrease in Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources is due to a change in the estimation methodology and new classi cation.
The overall increase in Mineral Resources is due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long term metal price.
5 Los Bronces Sulphide Dump Leach : The Mineral Resources increase due to the re-allocation of Probable Reserves to Inferred Resources, which is offset by a decrease due to changes in the cut-off grade strategy applied to material sent to the otation plant.
6 Mantos Blancos Sulphide Flotation : The increase in Mineral Resources is due to new drilling information which identi ed and delineated new resources offset by a re nement in the estimation methodology.
7 Mantos Blancos Oxide Vat and Heap Leach : The increase in Mineral Resources is due to increased feed from the Mercedes Dump offset by a change in the estimation methodology.
8 Mantos Blancos Oxide Dump Leach : The Mineral Resources increase due to additional material from Phase II of Mercedes Dump and Botadero B zones.
9 Mantoverde Oxide Heap Leach : The decrease in Mineral Resources is due to conversion to Ore Reserves enabled by new drilling information.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Quellaveco: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.2 %TCu cut-off.
The increase in the Mineral Resources is due to a change in economic assumptions increase in long term metal price, a change in the cut-off grade strategy and the addition of low-grade stockpile material.
2 Mantoverde Sulphide Project: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.35 %TCu cut-off.
The increase in Mineral Resources is primarily due to new drilling information.
There is a possibility to consider Oxides together with the Sulphides.
Oxide Mineral Resource estimates are as follows: Measured 53.2 Mt at 0.40 %ASCu: Indicated 4.0 Mt at 0.39 %ASCu: Inferred 10.1 Mt at 0.40 %ASCu.
3 Pebble: The Mineral Resources are based on drilling to May 2009 and a block model nalised in December 2009.
Reported Mineral Resources fall within a volume fide ned by resource price estimates and are based on a cut-off grade of 0.40% CuEq.
Calculation of copper equivalent CuEq is based on long term metal prices and takes into consideration the recovery of Copper, Gold and Molybdenum.
At a cut-off of 0.60% CuEq the estimate of Measured Resources is 278 Mt at 0.40% Cu, 0.42 g t Au, 0.020% Mo while the estimate of Indicated Resources is 3,319 Mt at 0.55% Cu, 0.42g t Au, 0.030% Mo.
4 Pebble co-product estimated grades: Measured Gold 0.36g t, Molybdenum 0.018%, CuEq average grade 0.66% Indicated Gold 0.37g t, Molybdenum 0.027%, CuEq average grade 0.85%.
Inferred Gold 0.31g t, Molybdenum 0.026%, CuEq average grade 0.67%.
5 Pebble: The property comprises 2,042 located Alaska State mineral claims which total 209,996 acres 84,982 hectares and which are currently valid.
6 Los Sulfatos: The reported resources include mineralisation inside a 1% nominal copper grade cut-off envelope down to the current drillhole depths of 1,000 metres below surface.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
7 San Enrique Monolito: The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
8 West Wall: The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an open pit operation to a depth of 600m below surface.
