The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and, unless stated otherwise, rounded to the nearest million.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets, and other relevant financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
The directors consider the following potential key areas of judgement required to be made in applying the Groups accounting policies: the determination of the revenue recognition approach to apply to individual contracts: the determination of assumptions underpinning the valuation of retirement benefit obligations for defined benefit pension schemes: and the determination of assumptions underpinning goodwill impairment testing.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 32.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
An explanation of the critical accounting estimates and judgements used in producing these consolidated financial statements is made in the Directors Report on page 38.
Changes in accounting policies With effect from 1 January 2012, the Group early adopted amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, which requires items within Other Comprehensive Income that may be reclassified to the income statement to be grouped together.
This amendment is concerned with disclosure only and has no impact on the reported results or financial position of the Group.
There were no other changes in accounting policies during the year.
A number of amendments to existing standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group except IAS 19 revised 2011, Employee Benefits, which replaces interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a finance cost component comprising net interest on the net defined benefit pension deficit calculated using the discount rate currently used to measure defined benefit pension liabilities.
If this amendment had been applied in 2012, pre-tax profit would have been 173m lower primarily because the discount rate is lower than the expected return on plan assets.
The net pension deficit would have been unchanged.
A number of new EU-endorsed standards, which are listed below, are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group and as such they have not been early adopted.
IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, defines the principle of control which is the basis for consolidation and sets out the accounting requirements for the preparation of consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, focuses on the rights and obligations of the parties to a joint arrangement rather than its legal form in determining whether it is a joint venture or a joint operation.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement disclosure requirements for use across other standards within IFRSs.
IFRS 13 does not extend the use of fair value accounting.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that are expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Consolidation The financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities, and include its share of its joint ventures results accounted for under the equity method, all of which are prepared to 31 December.
Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group.
Control is the power to govern the operating and financial policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Equity accounted investments An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies.
Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where the consolidated income statement includes its share of their profits and losses, and the consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
