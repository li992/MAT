Sources of funding are described in Section 8 below.
Cash and cash equivalents includes encumbered cash of 7.5m 2011: 5.5m.
This is cash relating to customer advance payments.
6.2 Group non recourse debt The Groups debt is non recourse if no Group company other than the relevant borrower has an obligation to repay the debt under a guarantee or other arrangement.
The debt is excluded from all of our credit agreements and other covenant calculations, and therefore has no impact on the Groups ability to borrow.
Group non recourse debt increased by 9.6m to 25.1m.
The increase is mainly due to additional asset nancing on the National Physical Laboratory contract.
Pensions The Group is a sponsor of a number of dened benefit schemes and dened contribution schemes.
At 31 December 2012, the net retirement benefit asset included in the balance sheet arising from our dened benefit pension scheme obligations was 14.1m 2011: 16.8m, on a pension scheme asset base of 1.9bn.

Within this charge, the Groups contributions to UK and other dened contribution pension schemes increased to 85.1m 2011: 80.4m.
The service charge relating to the Groups dened benefit schemes decreased to 27.4m 2011: 31.9m principally as a result of a 6.1m curtailment gain relating to the disposal of the Technical Services business.
This curtailment gain resulted from active members of the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS becoming deferred members, creating a reduction in scheme liabilities.
The gain is recognised in the income statement within the gain on disposal of the Technical Services business.
Serco has three main types of scheme which are accounted for as dened benefit pension schemes.
Each type has its own accounting treatment under IFRS.
These are: O Non-contract specic schemes which do not relate to specic contracts or franchises.
For these schemes we charge the actuarial gain or loss for the year to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income the SOCI : O Reimbursable schemes where we have a right of full cost reimbursement and therefore include both the pension scheme deficit and offsetting reimbursable rights debtor in the balance sheet: and O Not certain to be reimbursable schemes relating to specic contracts or franchises, where the deficit will pass back to the customer or to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
For these schemes, we charge the actuarial gain or loss on our share of the deficit for the year to the SOCI, recognise a recoverable intangible asset on the balance sheet at the start of the contract or franchise and amortise the intangible asset to the income statement over the contract or franchise life.
