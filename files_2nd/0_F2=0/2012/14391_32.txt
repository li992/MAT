Capital employed is a non-statutory measure of invested resources.
It comprises statutory net assets adjusted to add goodwill recognised directly in reserves in respect of subsidiaries acquired before 1 August 1998 of 815.2m 2011: 815.2m and eliminate post-retirement benefit assets and liabilities and litigation provisions relating to exceptional items, both net of related tax, and net debt.
In the light of the recognition of the Titeex litigation provision in 2012, the board has decided to exclude significant litigation provisions from the denition of capital employed.
Accordingly, capital employed in 2011 has been restated to exclude the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision and related deferred tax.

Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 105 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Notes to the accounts Continued 3 Headline profit measures The Company seeks to present a measure of underlying performance which is not impacted by exceptional items or items considered non-operational in nature.
This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to material litigation in respect of products no longer in production: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: other nancing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39: and nancing credits and charges relating to retirement benets.
The excluded items are referred to as non-headline items.

Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 106 4 Exceptional items An analysis of the amounts presented as exceptional items in these financial statements is given below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 m m Operating items Restructuring programmes 15.4 15.7 Revision of estimated rebates 7.8 Diabetes 0.6 1.5 Gains on changes to post-retirement benets note 10 10.2 profit on disposal of businesses 30.8 4.4 Adjustment to contingent consideration provided on acquisitions 2.4 Costs of acquisitions 2.0 1.5 Litigation provision for Titeex Corporation subrogation claims note 22 54.5 provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation note 22 39.6 28.3 85.5 29.4 Financing items Exceptional finance costs adjustment to discounted provision provision for Titeex Corporation subrogation claims note 22 0.5 provision for John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation note 22 4.0 6.1 90.0 35.5 Taxation items Exceptional tax costs write off UK deferred tax asset 37.7 127.7 35.5 Year ended 31 July 2012 Restructuring costs comprise 12.6m in respect of the improvement programme in Smiths Detection announced in September 2011 and 2.8m in respect of the divisional reorganisation which began in 2008.
These two programmes, which involve redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, are considered exceptional by virtue of their size.
A charge of 7.8m has been made by Smiths Medical to reect a change to the historical basis of estimating the accrual for rebates to distributors see note 1.
This change has arisen due to the availability of improved data from distributors.
Had this approach been used in previous years, there would have been no material impact on the revenue or operating profits of Smiths Medical in any of the prior five financial years and no material impact is expected on future revenue or profit.
The charge, which has been recognised as a reduction in revenue, has been treated as an exceptional item on the basis that it is an unusual non-recurring item that distorts the current year trading performance.
The profit on disposal of businesses comprises 26.8m profit on the sale of the Groups interest in Cross Match see note 14, 0.1m relating to small non-core business sold in the year and 3.9m from the resolution of indemnities in respect of disposals in previous years.
A charge of 54.5m has been made by Titeex Corporation in respect of the estimated cost of future claims from insurance companies seeking recompense for damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes see note 22.
The operating charge in respect of John Crane, Inc. litigation comprises 28.3m in respect of increased provisions for adverse judgments and legal defence costs, 0.9m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers, and 10.4m arising from the reduction in US risk free rates.
At 31 July 2011 the Group recognised UK tax assets relating to revenue losses brought forward and deferred capital allowances of 37.7m.
The value of these assets is reviewed regularly and is dependent on the ability to recover them against forecast UK taxable profits.
Having considered the impact of the increased pension deficit on the outlook for the UK tax base, the Group has decided to derecognise the tax assets at 31 July 2012 as an exceptional non-headline tax charge because it is no longer probable that they will be recovered.
Year ended 31 July 2011 The restructuring of corporate headquarters and divisional reorganisation was announced in 2008, and a second phase of this project was introduced in 2010.
The total cost of this restructuring, including redundancy, relocation and consolidation of manufacturing, was considered exceptional by virtue of its size.
Costs of 15.7m were recognised in the year ended 31 July 2011.
The profit on disposal of businesses included 2.7m in respect of the disposal of a small Detection operation.
Costs of acquisition comprised costs directly attributable to the work undertaken during the year to investigate and complete acquisitions.
The operating charge of 28.3m in respect of John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation comprised 6.1m in respect of increased provision for adverse legal judgments, 9.3m in respect of increased provision for legal defence costs, 11.9m arising from movements in the discounting and 1.0m in respect of legal fees in connection with litigation against insurers and defence strategy.

The UK schemes are closed and this amount represents tax relief that was set off against amounts previously charged to equity.
The reduction mainly relates to 23.5m of deferred tax no longer recognised on UK losses see below offset by 10.1m deferred tax relating to additional loss recognition in the US: and a deferred tax asset of 76.2m 2011: 65.0m relating to provisions where current tax relief is only available as payments are made.
Of this asset, 51.1m 2011: 50.6m relates to the John Crane, Inc. litigation provision, and 23.0m 2011: 3.7m relates to Titeex Corporation.
See note 22 for additional information on provisions.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of 380.4m 2011: 225.4m and pensions and other long term liabilities of 504.3m 2011: 96.9m due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
This includes 327.1m 2011: 2.3m relating to the UK pension deficit.
The large increase in unrecognised deferred tax on losses mainly relates to the UK.
Deferred tax of 23.5m on UK losses and 14.2m on other assets has been derecognised this year as potentially higher contributions to retirement benefit schemes mean the UK is unlikely to generate sufficient taxable profits to utilise the deductible temporary differences related to the deferred tax assets, The resulting charge of 37.7m has been treated as an exceptional tax item note 4.
These tax allowances remain available to the Group and can be utilised should the UK tax base improve.

The arrangements include dened benefit and dened contribution plans and, mainly in the United Kingdom UK and United States of America US, post retirement healthcare.
The principal dened benefit pension plans are in the UK and in the US and these have been closed so that no future benets are accrued.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent,  actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes SIPS and TIGPS were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2009 and 5 April 2009.
The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2010.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualied actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2012.
The triennial valuations of the principal UK schemes at 31 March 2012 and 5 April 2012 are in progress.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2012 2011 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 3.1% n a n a 2.9% Rate of increase for active deferred members 3.7% n a n a 4.4% n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8% n a 0.8% 3.5% n a 1.3% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8% n a 0.8% 3.5% n a 0.6% Discount rate 4.1% 3.8% 4.1% 5.3% 5.1% 5.3% Ination rate 2.8% n a 1.6% 3.5% n a 1.8% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% n a 2.3% 5.0% n a 2.5% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the new SAPS All birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the 2011 CMI projections blended to a long term rate of 1% for SIPS, and in line with 80% 60% of the Long Cohort for males females respectively with an annual underpin of 1% for TIGPS.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the most recent mortality study table produced for retired pensioners in the US RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classication blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK US Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 in UK TIGPS SIPS 22 23 24 25 19 21 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 26 19 21 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2012 were: 31 July 2012 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 7.2% 1,294.1 7.3% 245.1 9.2% 12.9 1,552.1 Government bonds 2.5% 168.0 2.3% 43.5 4.8% 7.0 218.5 Corporate bonds 4.1% 81.8 3.8% 169.5 5.0% 0.5 251.8 Insured liabilities 4.1% 665.7 4.1% 3.7 669.4 Property 6.8% 177.1 10.4% 0.8 177.9 Other 2.9% 458.2 3.7% 19.7 477.9 Total market value 2,844.9 458.1 44.6 3,347.6 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 3,116.7 680.6 66.3 3,863.6 deficit 271.8 222.5 21.7 516.0 Unfunded pension plans 46.1 6.9 28.0 81.0 Post-retirement healthcare 9.2 13.0 0.9 23.1 Present value of unfunded obligations 55.3 19.9 28.9 104.1 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 0.1 0.1 Net pension liability 327.1 242.4 50.7 620.2 Post-retirement assets 7.2 7.2 Post-retirement liabilities 334.3 242.4 50.7 627.4 Net pension liability 327.1 242.4 50.7 620.2 Where any individual scheme shows a recoverable surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset.
The IAS 19 surplus of any one scheme is not available to fund the IAS 19 deficit of another scheme.
The retirement benefit asset disclosed arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.
If the pension schemes were wound up while they had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benets of all members.
The buy outs would cost signicantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19.

The scheme assets do not include any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, nor other assets used by, the Group.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant industries.
The overall rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the schemes investment portfolios.

Following completion of the triennial actuarial valuation of the principal UK dened benefit schemes SIPS and TIGPS as at 31 March 2009 and 5 April 2009, the Group agreed 10 year funding plans which require the following contributions: Cash contributions to SIPS of 36m a year for 10 years.
An initial investment of 25m in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account with further ongoing monthly investments of 2m for nine years.
The first monthly instalment was paid in August 2011.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group see note 15 until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow are allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
A cash contribution to the TIGPS of 50m which was paid in May 2012, with further biannual payments of 8m thereafter.
These payments were subject to the funding position of the Scheme in the six months ended 5 April 2012.
Triennial valuations of the principal UK schemes as at 31 March 2012 and 5 April 2012 are currently in progress, and the Group will negotiate new funding plans with the scheme trustees based on these valuations.
In addition to the funding plans referred to above, the Group agreed to make cash contributions to other schemes in respect of any future service cost based on actuarial advice.
In 2013 the following cash contributions to the Groups principal dened benefit schemes are expected: 36m to SIPS: 16m to TIGPS: and approximately 38m to other plans, including the US dened benefit scheme.
Expected cash payments for 2013 total 90m.
In addition, 24m will be invested in UK government bonds held in escrow, in accordance with the funding plan explained above.

Sensitivity The valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2012 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to ination which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

Dened contribution plans The Group operates a number of dened contribution plans across many countries.
In the UK a dened contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK dened benefit pension plans.
In the US a 401k dened contribution plan operates.
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of all these plans was 29.0m 2011: 29.6m.

Costs of 0.3m 2011: 0.2m were incurred in respect of this arrangement.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected riskadjusted cash-ows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-ows are based on the 2013 budget and the four year divisional strategic plan, which have both been approved by the Board.
Goodwill is allocated by division as follows: 2012 2011 2012 Number of 2011 Number of m CGUs m CGUs John Crane 139.2 4 132.9 6 Smiths Medical 514.5 1 497.2 1 Smiths Detection 376.9 1 406.9 1 Smiths Interconnect 341.5 3 237.5 4 Flex-Tek 22.3 2 21.3 2 1,394.4 11 1,295.8 14 As discussed in the business review, both John Crane and Smiths Interconnect have changed their sub-divisional reporting structure this year.
The divisions now report and review performance using fewer regional groups and business units.
As required by IAS 36, following these reorganisations, the allocation of goodwill to CGUs for impairment testing was reviewed, and it was established that goodwill is now monitored, and should be tested for impairment, using the new reporting structures.
John Crane and Smiths Medical have strong aftermarket and consumables businesses, with consistent sales trends.
Smiths Detection and Smiths Interconnect have greater sales and margin volatility due to lower levels of recurring revenue and involvement in government funded programmes, particularly defence, and customer led technology innovation.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and projections of developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specic to the CGU being tested.
Pre-tax rates of 12.3% to 14.1% 2011: 11.1% to 14.1% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long term growth rates: As required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.29% 2011: 2.42%.
These rates do not reect the long-term assumptions used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Smiths Smiths Medical Detection Smiths Interconnect Power Microwave Connectors management Year ended 31 July 2012 Net book value of goodwill m 514.5 376.9 134.2 84.7 122.6 Discount rate 12.3% 13.5% 14.1% 14.1% 13.1% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.20% 2.50% 2.72% 2.32% 2.59% Year ended 31 July 2011 Net book value of goodwill m 497.2 406.9 128.4 80.8 28.3 Discount rate 11.2% 11.2% 13.0% 11.1% 13.0% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.47% 2.00% 2.25% 2.25% 2.25% The 2011 information for Smiths Interconnect has been restated to reect the new CGU structure, with weighted averages disclosed for the discount rate and growth rates.
The remaining balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to smaller CGUs.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 118 12 Intangible assets continued Impairment testing continued Goodwill continued Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that for Smiths Interconnect Power management, the following changes in assumptions in isolation, would cause the value in use to fall below the carrying value: Change required to trigger impairment Forecast operating cash-ow 12% reduction Discount rate 1.4% higher Long-term growth rates 2.8% lower For the other CGUs, sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
In the year ended 31 July 2012 impairment charges of 10.7m were incurred on intangible assets arising from the PDI acquisition.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
The impairment charges arose because product sales have been lower than expected with a consequential impact on the future value of the technology, customer relationships and brands.
The impairment charge has been included in Smiths Interconnect administrative expenses and it is excluded from the calculation of headline operating profit.
In the year ended 31 July 2011 impairment charges of 5.5m were incurred on intangible assets acquired in two other business combinations.
The impairment charges arose because current and forecast profitability was below the levels originally projected.
The impairment charge was included in Smiths Interconnect administrative expenses and excluded from the calculation of headline operating profit.

Management considers that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
Trade and other receivables, including prepayments, accrued income and other debtors qualifying as financial instruments are classied as loans and receivables.
The maximum credit exposure arising from these financial assets is 628.4m 2011: 606.5m.
Trade receivables are disclosed net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
The provisions for bad and doubtful debts are based on specic risk assessment and reference to past default experience.
Credit risk is managed separately for each customer and, where appropriate, a credit limit is set for the customer based on previous experience of the customer and third party credit ratings.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The largest single customer is the US Federal Government, representing less than 4% 2011: 6% of Group revenue.

20 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt nancing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specic guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 17. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-ow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Similarly, financial instruments included in trade and other payables comprise trade payables, accrued expenses and other creditors which qualify as financial instruments.
Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Impact Gain loss Impact Gain loss on profit recognised in on profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2012 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 31 July 2011 m m m m US dollar 0.1 4.2 5.9 3.4 Euro 3.6 4.1 1.8 4.2 Sterling 4.1 0.9 0.5 1.6 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
Cash-ow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2012 contracts with a nominal value of 279.4m 2011: 217.7m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 249.9m 2011: 241.0m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-ow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 21.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-ows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 98.5% are for periods of 12 months or less 2011: 99.9%.
The movements in the cash-ow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 m m Brought forward cash-ow hedge reserve at start of year 0.3 0.6 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.1 Gains losses on effective cash-ow hedges recognised in equity 10.9 0.4 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 5.5 0.2 cost of sales 0.9 0.4 Carried forward cash-ow hedge reserve at end of year 4.7 0.3 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 123 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Notes to the accounts Continued 20 Financial risk management continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be signicantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2012 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 590.9 240.9 831.8 Currency swap contracts 192.4 69.4 39.2 83.8 192.4 660.3 280.1 83.8 831.8 At 31 July 2011 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 567.2 260.1 827.3 Currency swap contracts 192.6 45.6 39.2 107.8 192.6 612.8 299.3 107.8 827.3 At 31 July 2012 swap contracts in other currencies hedged the Groups exposure to Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi 31 July 2011: Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
Of the contracts designated as net investment hedges, 55% 2011: 54% are current and the balance matures over the next three years 2011: three years.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 120.3 128.2 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 0.2 7.9 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 120.1 120.3 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised in recognised in hedge reserve hedge reserve 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 m m US dollar 65.6 60.4 Euro 25.0 27.6 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 124 20 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be xed for greater than 60% of the level of net debt.
This is achieved primarily through xed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2012 92.0% 2011: 98.5% of the Groups net borrowings were at xed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2012, after interest rate swaps, is 5.5% 2011: 5.5%.
Interest rate prole of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of investments, cash and borrowings.
The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.

These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from uctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 21.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 190.0m 2011: 196.3m debt from xed rate to oating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant income statement exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2012, and taking into consideration all xed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average oating interest rates for all three currencies would have a 0.6m 2011: nil impact on the Groups profit before tax.
Based on the investments held at 31 July 2012 a one percentage point 100 basis points increase in sterling interest rates would reduce the carrying value of investments by 8.7m, generating a corresponding charge to reserves.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables and derivatives, totals 266.5m at 31 July 2012 2011: 292.7m.

Litigation John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
An adverse judgment at first instance from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois is currently under appeal.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufciently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efcacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 221,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 33 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 86,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 115 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$111m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs and, whilst the number of claims being led against JCI and other defendants has been declining, the proportion of mesothelioma claims has increased, and JCIs ability to defend these cases successfully is likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 128 22 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Litigation continued John Crane, Inc. continued The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
The future trend of legal costs.
The rate of future claims led.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing levels of new claims based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections and is determined using asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon, see note 25.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 m m Gross provision 226.3 203.1 Discount 13.2 21.4 Discounted pre-tax provision 213.1 181.7 Deferred tax 51.1 50.6 Discounted post-tax provision 162.0 131.1 Titeex Corporation In recent years Titeex Corporation, a subsidiary of the Group in the Flex-Tek division, has received a number of claims from insurance companies seeking recompense on a subrogated basis for the effects of damage allegedly caused by lightning strikes in relation to its exible gas piping product.
Titeex Corporation believes that its products are a safe and effective means of delivering gas when installed in accordance with the manufacturers instructions and local and national codes, however some claims have been settled on an individual basis without admission of liability.
The number of claims received each year and the cost of resolving them has varied but, more recently, has cost between 3m and 5m a year.
These costs have historically been charged against headline operating profit.
Equivalent third-party products in the US marketplace face similar challenges with the prole of legal activity appearing to increase in recent times.
The continuing progress of claims and the pattern of settlement, together with the recent market place activity, now provide sufficient evidence to recognise a liability in the accounts.
Therefore provision has been made for the costs which the Group is expected to incur in respect of future subrogation claims to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
Titeex Corporation sells exible gas piping with extensive installation and safety guidance revised in 2008 designed to assure the safety of the product and minimise the risk of damage associated with lightning strikes.
The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision, which are based on past experience, include: The period over which expenditure can be reliably estimated The number of future settlements The average amount of settlements The projections use a rolling 10 year time horizon on the basis that there is substantial uncertainty in the US litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon, see note 25.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision of 61.8m 11.2m is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.

It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
The JCI and Titeex Corporation litigation provisions are the only provisions which are discounted.

In the year the Company issued nil 2011: nil shares to the Trust, and the Trust purchased 1,026,514 2011: 700,892 shares in the market.
At 31 July 2012 the Trust held 855 2011: 855 ordinary shares with a market value of 0.0m 2011: 0.0m.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases: revaluations of property, plant and equipment: and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively.
Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit assets and liabilities, net litigation provisions relating to exceptional items and net debt.
Capital employed has been restated, see note 1.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
See note 1 for details of the restatement of capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain exibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The Group has a target gearing, calculated on a market value basis, of approximately 20%.
At the balance sheet date the Group had gearing of 17% 2011: 15%.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of nancing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2012 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2011: BBB Baa2 with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The credit rating is managed through the following cash-ow targets: headline operating cash conversion of greater than 80% and a ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of less than two.
The Board aims for dividend cover of around 2.5 times, to ensure that the Group retains sufficient cash to finance investment in growth.

Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 130 25 Contingent liabilities and commitments John Crane, Inc. As stated in note 22, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos bres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
The Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by this provision: however, because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation beyond this period, the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Titeex Corporation As stated in Note 22, Titeex Corporation has made provision for the cost of expected future subrogation claims.
The Group considers claims might continue beyond the period covered by the provision: however because of the uncertainty surrounding the US litigation environment beyond this period, the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Other contingent liabilities and commitments In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to litigation such as product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents, and product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
At 31 July 2012, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 167.4m 2011: 137.8m, including pension commitments of 49.5m 2011: 43.1m.
From time to time the Group co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.

Headline operating cash-ow is net cash inow from headline operating activities less capital expenditure.
See note 3 for a description of headline profit measures.
Free cash-ow is cash-ow after interest and tax but before acquisitions, nancing activities and dividends.
The tables below reconcile these two measures to statutory cash-ow measures.

TCE October 2011 on behalf of John Crane and 100% of the equity share capital of Power Holdings Inc. PDI October 2011 on behalf of Smiths Interconnect.
TCE services, repairs and builds replacement bearings and seals used in critical rotating equipment.
This acquisition adds capability for servicing bearings to the John Crane aftermarket platform, creating an end-to-end product and service solution for John Cranes customers.
The intangible assets recognised on this acquisition comprise the order book on acquisition, customer relationships and a contractual non-compete agreement.
Goodwill represents the potential future growth from expanding the business through the John Crane global service network.
The goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
PDI designs and manufactures specialist power distribution, conditioning and monitoring systems.
PDI will be incorporated into Smiths Interconnects Power management group, where it expands the range of power quality technologies into new, specialised, high growth markets.
The intangible assets recognised on this acquisition comprise technology, customer relationships and trademarks.
Goodwill represents the potential future growth from expanding the customer base and developing new technologies.
28.0m of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2012, the acquisitions contributed 60.1m to revenue, 4.4m to headline profit before taxation and loss of 16.1m to profit before taxation due to the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangible assets.
If Smiths had acquired the businesses at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisitions would have contributed 78.7m to revenue and a loss of 22.7m to profit before tax.

The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP is a share plan under which an award over a capped number of shares will vest after the end of the three year performance period if performance conditions are met.
Group LTIP awards are made to selected senior corporate executives, including the executive directors.
These awards have three performance conditions: 50% of the award is conditional on 3-year headline EPS growth: 30% of the award is conditional on 3-year TSR relative to the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies : and 20% of the award is conditional on 3-year average annual headline cash conversion.
Divisional LTIP awards are made to selected divisional senior executives.
These awards also have three performance conditions, and the relative signicance of the conditions reects the strategic priorities for each division: 20% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year revenue growth: 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year average annual headline operating margins: and 30% to 40% of the awards are conditional on 3-year average annual headline cash conversion.
Each performance condition has a threshold below which no shares vest and a maximum performance target at or above which the award vests in full.
For performance between threshold and maximum, awards vest on a straight-line sliding scale.
The performance conditions are assessed separately, so performance on one condition does not affect the vesting of the other elements of the award.
To the extent that the performance targets are not met over the 3-year performance period, awards will lapse.
There is no re-testing of the performance conditions.
2010 Value Sharing Plan 2010 VSP The 2010 VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 November 2010 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
The awards have the same structure and calculation methods as the 2008 VSP.
The performance conditions are measured over a three-year period commencing with the financial year 2010 11, and the Group scheme hurdle rate is 8.5% a year.
2008 Value Sharing Plan 2008 VSP The VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award will depend on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies and the remaining two-thirds of each award will be determined by the growth in internal value in excess of xed rate.
The growth in internal value is calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times the ratio of PBT to market capitalisation determined at the date of grant plus net equity cash-ows to shareholders.
The divisional awards will depend on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant works.
The performance conditions are measured over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
For the Group scheme, the growth in internal value is tested against a hurdle rate of 9.5% a year.
Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2012 133 Accounts Governance Risks and responsibility Business review Chairman and Chief Executive Group overview Notes to the accounts Continued 29 Employee share schemes continued Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in ofce and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants have been required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of ROCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 992.15p 2011: 1,240.24p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.
Exercisable weighted Weighted average average Options Options exercise price Total shares remaining exercisable at exercisable at for options under option contractual life 31 July 2012 31 July 2011 exercisable at Range of exercise prices 000 months 000 000 31 July 2012 0.00 2.00 4,008 18 0.00 2.01 6.00 463 17 2 2 5.69 6.01 10.00 1,979 42 1,387 2,106 8.52 10.01 14.00 1,032 62 947 907 10.97 For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the Binomial option pricing model has been used for most schemes and the Monte Carlo method is used for schemes with total shareholder return performance targets.
The key assumptions used in the models for 2012 and 2011 are volatility of 27% to 30% 2011: 30% and dividend yield of 3.75% 2011: 3.33%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 9.44 2011: 12.40, group long term incentive plans of 7.14 2011: 13.86 and divisional long term incentive plans of 8.94 2011: 12.35.
The fair value disclosed for the CIP award treats the two matching shares as separate options.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 14.3m 2011: 13.8m, of which 14.4m 2011: 13.8m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.
At 31 July 2012 the creditor relating to cash-settled schemes is 0.4m 2011: 0.6m.
