Segmental information continued Reorganisation of portfolio As a result of the decreasing number of new businesses set up or established over the past two years, for the period commencing 1 April 2011, the CODM has discontinued the new business segment and incorporated the initiatives into the segment operated by the appropriate member of the GEMG.
The decision to no longer report the new business segment reflects managements decision 12 months ago to focus on organic expansion and developing partnerships with customers.
This has resulted in a low level of new business initiatives which do not otherwise meet the criteria to be reported under core segments.
No longer presenting new businesses separately results in the other segments initially showing lower margins as businesses such as Brazil move towards operational maturity.
The comparative periods have been re-presented for this change.
The business consists of regional voice businesses in EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific, a global electronic business active in fixed income interest rate derivatives and FX markets and a global post trade risk and information services business.
The Group continues to disclose an operating segment for the voice business in Asia Pacific even though this segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds to be mandatory under IFRS8 Operating segments.
This is to reflect the importance of the Asia Pacific region to the Group and the way the Group is managed.
