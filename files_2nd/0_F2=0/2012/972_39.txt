ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PHOSPHATE PRODUCTS estimates as at 31 December 2012 ANGLO AMERICAN FOSFATOS BRASIL LIMITADA The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Ouvidor Oxide Ore Reserves: The decrease is due to production.
2 Ouvidor Oxide Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 7% P O cut-off and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
LOM Plan material includes 29.8Mt at 11.64% 2 5 2 5 P O Oxide in the MCG01 tenement.
Currently Anglo American owns the mineral rights but not the surface rights for the area within MCG01 overlying the Inferred ex.
3 Coqueiros: The Oxide mineralisation is fide ned by a cut-off grade of 7% P O and a CaO P O ratio between 1 and 1.4.
