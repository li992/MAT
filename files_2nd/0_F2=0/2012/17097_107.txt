Provision is made for rent and other property related costs for the period that a sub-let or assignment of the lease is not possible.
Where the property is deemed likely to be assigned, provision is made for the best estimate of the reverse lease premium payable on the assignment.
Where the property is deemed likely to be sub-let, the rental income and the timing of the cash flows are estimated by both internal and external property specialists and a provision is maintained for the cost incurred by the Group.
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using a discount rate of 3.74% 2011: 3.74% based on an approximation for a risk-free rate.
The amount and timing of the cash outflows are subject to variations.
The Group utilises the skills and expertise of both internal and external property experts to determine the provision held.
Provisions are expected to be utilised over a period of up to 25 years.
