co. uk At 1 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 11 Earnings per share The basic earnings per share figures are calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders, therefore before noncontrolling interests, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after deducting treasury shares and shares held by an independently managed employee share ownership trust ESOT.
The diluted earnings per share figures allow for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.
Where the share price at the year end is lower than the option price the options become antidilutive and are excluded from the calculation.
The number of such options was nil 2011: nil.
