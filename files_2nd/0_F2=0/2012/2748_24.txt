Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Assets and Investments: Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets This section focuses on the oil and gas assets which form the core of our business, including details of corporate acquisitions made in the year, exploration costs incurred in the year, those written off or impaired, those transferred to development producing assets and capital commitments existing at the year end.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Timing of the acquisition of Agora Oil & Gas AS Cairn announced the acquisition of Agora Oil & Gas AS on 3 April 2012 but did not receive all required approvals to complete the acquisition until 9 May.
The later date is therefore used as the acquisition date for accounting purposes.
In the period between 3 April and 9 May, Agora completed the successful Skarfjell exploration well in the Norwegian North Sea.
The fair values of the Agora assets on acquisition reflect the initial assessment of the successful outcome of the Skarjfell exploration well.
Indicators of impairment for intangible exploration appraisal assets Cairn have reviewed intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with IFRS 6 and concluded that such indicators did exist on certain of the Groups assets.
Impairment tests were therefore conducted on those assets where indicators of impairments were identified.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Fair values attributed to exploration assets on acquisition of subsidiaries The Group acquired two subsidiaries during the year, both of which contained exploration and appraisal assets.
In determining the fair values attributable to those assets, Cairn has used discounted cash flow modelling techniques as an estimate of fair value where no recent third party transactions existed on which a market-based fair value could be determined.
The use of discounted cash flow techniques includes key estimates on long term oil price, discount rates, recoverable hydrocarbon reserves and the costs of development and production facilities.
Until field development plans are approved these estimates remain highly subjective, reflecting the inherent risks associated with exploration activities.
Impairment testing of intangible exploration appraisal assets Where indicators of impairment have been identified on certain licences in Greenland and Nepal, there are no development or producing assets within the same operating segment to support the carrying value of the exploration costs incurred.
All such costs have therefore been impaired in full.
2.1 Corporate Acquisitions Agora Oil & Gas AS On 9 May 2012, Cairn Energy PLC completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Agora Oil & Gas AS.
Agora was a private Norwegian company with non-operated exploration assets in both the Norwegian North Sea and, through its wholly owned subsidiary Agora Oil and Gas UK Limited, in the United Kingdom North Sea.
Agora Oil & Gas AS was acquired as the first step towards Cairns stated goal of expanding its portfolio by adding lower risk, near-term exploration, appraisal and development assets to complement transformational frontier exploration in other regions, resulting in a more balanced business overall.
The acquisition added drilling activity to Cairns 2012 exploration and appraisal programme, with six wells drilled in the UK and Norway during the period from acquisition.
The acquisition included Agoras 15% stake in the Catcher area planned for development.
Nautical Petroleum plc On 8 August 2012, Capricorn Energy completed the acquisition of 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Nautical Petroleum plc.
Nautical was an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, incorporated in England and Wales and headquartered in London.
Nauticals assets include exploration assets nearing development in the United Kingdom North Sea including interests in the Catcher, Kraken and Mariner fields and further exploration licences in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Morocco.
One exploration well was drilled in the period post acquisition.
Nautical was acquired to expand Cairns portfolio in North-West Europe and to continue its strategy of balancing its transformational exploration portfolio with appraisal and development assets.
Amongst other items, the acquisition increased Cairns equity position in the Catcher area by a further 15%, taking Cairns overall interest to 30%.
The Catcher area contains several oil discoveries and follow-on prospectivity.
The acquisition also brings a material stake in Kraken, another large, North Sea oil development project.

Similarly, the goodwill of $259.6m recognised on the acquisition of Nautical also arises largely from deferred tax provided of $269.4m on the temporary taxable difference between the fair value of intangible exploration appraisal assets acquired and their respective tax base costs.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Consideration and costs of acquisition The fair value of the 47,662,603 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for Agora $256.9m was determined on the basis of CairnEnergy PLCs closing share price on 9 May 2012 of 3.39 $5.39.
All other consideration was settled in cash.
Acquisition costs of $11.2m are included within other expenses.
$4.3m relates to the acquisition of Agora with the remaining $6.9m relating to Nautical.
Impact on profit for the year The Groups profit has been reduced by the Agora Group loss of $53.7m and reduced by the Nautical Group loss of $4.4m for the period between the respective dates of acquisition and the Balance Sheet date.
Had the results of the Nautical and Agora Groups been included in the full years results to 31 December 2012, Cairn Groups profit for the year would have been $60.6m.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Assets and Investments: Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets Continued 2.2 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting Policies summarised Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-bywell basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
In such circumstances the exploration appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same operating segment and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
At the year end or prior to the intangible exploration appraisal assets being transferred to assets held-for-sale, the Group reviews intangible exploration assets for indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator is identified, the asset is tested for impairment.

The Catcher and Kraken assets are nearing development while the Skarfjell discovery is currently under appraisal.
Greenland costs are primarily those incurred on Cairns licences where no drilling has taken place.
The majority of these costs relate to the Pitu block in the Baffin Bay area, offshore Northern Greenland and on the Groups blocks in Southern Greenland where 3D seismic was acquired during 2011.
Other assets in the Mediterranean and Morocco are at the early exploration stage.
The first well to be drilled in Morocco is targeted for 2013.
Acquisitions Acquisition costs of $976.5m represent the fair value of exploration and appraisal assets added through the acquisitions of Agora Oil & Gas AS $411.0m and Nautical Petroleum plc $565.5m.
Disposals The Group received $33.3m to cover back costs and bonuses under the terms of the farm down agreement with Statoil for the Pitu block west of Greenland.
Proceeds are credited against the Groups existing intangible exploration appraisal costs relating to that asset.
Transfers to property plant & equipment development producing assets In December 2012, the Mariner field development plan FDP was sanctioned by Joint Venture partners and costs of $70.4m were transferred to property plant & equipment development producing assets, after testing for impairment.
The Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC approved the FDP in February 2013.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 97 Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Assets and Investments: Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets Continued 2.2 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Continued Unsuccessful exploration costs Following the corporate acquisitions, Cairn has participated in seven exploration wells in the UK and Norwegian North Sea during 2012.
Six wells have been plugged and abandoned resulting in a total write-off of $159.0m in respect of North Sea assets.
The Tybalt well, completed in June, failed to demonstrate the presence of moveable hydrocarbons, resulting in a write-off of $50.2m.
The Kakelborg exploration well, completed in August, did not encounter targeted reservoir rocks and was therefore permanently plugged and abandoned.
Costs of $34.1m on this well have been written off.
Geite, Bardolph and Spaniards East did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and these wells have also been plugged and abandoned, resulting in a charge to the Income Statement of unsuccessful exploration costs of $45.3m.
The Timon well was spudded in May 2012, suspended then completed during February 2013.
However the well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and will be plugged and abandoned with costs incurred at 31 December 2012 of $29.4m charged to the Income Statement.
Cost reductions relating to the 2011 exploration campaign in Greenland result in a $6.1m reversal of unsuccessful exploration costs in the current year.
These reductions were primarily due to final contract closures.
Total unsuccessful exploration cost write-offs for 2011 were $941.8m, all relating to Greenland assets.
Impairment At this time, the Group has no firm plans in place to drill further on the blocks drilled in Greenland during 2010 and 2011 and at 31 December 2011, Cairn concluded that indicators of impairment existed on non-well specific exploration costs associated with these blocks.
As there is no development or producing asset in the Greenland operating segment, these costs were impaired in full and $74.9m charged to the Income Statement.
At 31 December 2012, Cairn has recognised further impairment charges of $5.8m on costs relating to these and other licences where no further exploration work is planned.
No indicators of impairment were identified on any of the Groups other intangible exploration appraisal assets.
