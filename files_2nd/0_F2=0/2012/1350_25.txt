a Trade receivables: credit risk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 23.
The credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and the invoicing conventions established in, the Groups markets.
The contractual terms on invoices issued to customers vary between the US and the UK in that, invoices issued by A-Plant are payable within 3060 days whereas, invoices issued by Sunbelt are payable on receipt.
Therefore, on this basis, a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables are contractually past due.
The allowance for bad and doubtful receivables is calculated based on prior experience reflecting the level of uncollected receivables over the last year within each business.
Accordingly, this cannot be attributed to specific receivables so the aged analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is shown gross of the allowance for bad and doubtful receivables.
On this basis, the ageing analysis of trade receivables, including those past due, is as follows: Trade receivables past due by: Less than 30 60 60 90 More than Current 30 days days days 90 days Total m m m m m m Carrying value at 30 April 2012 20.7 79.7 35.5 11.5 15.2 162.6 Carrying value at 30 April 2011 19.6 68.5 33.5 10.3 14.0 145.9 In practice, Sunbelt operates on 30-day terms and considers receivables past due if they are unpaid after 30 days.

The growth rate assumptions used in the plans reflect managements expectations of market developments and take account of past performance.
The valuation uses an annual growth rate to determine the cash flows beyond the three-year period of 2%, which does not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets, and a terminal value reflective of market multiples.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the projected cash flows is 9.5% 2011: 9.5%.
The impairment review is sensitive to a change in key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate and the annuity growth rates.
A sensitivity analysis has been undertaken by changing the key assumptions used for both Sunbelt and A-Plant.
Based on this sensitivity analysis, no reasonably possible change in the assumptions resulted in the carrying value of the goodwill in Sunbelt being reduced to the recoverable amount.
A-Plant has headroom of 4m at the reporting date.
An increase in the discount rate of 9.5% by 0.2% or a decrease in the annuity growth rate of 2% by 0.3% would eradicate the headroom.

First priority senior secured credit facility At 30 April 2012, $1.4bn was committed by our senior lenders under the asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility ABL facility until March 2016 while the amount utilised was $918m including letters of credit totalling $25m.
Since the year end the Company has obtained additional commitments from its lenders which have increased the size of the ABL facility by $400m to $1.8bn, with no other changes to its terms or to the March 2016 maturity.
The ABL facility is secured by a first priority interest in substantially all of the Groups assets.
Pricing for the revolving credit facility is based on the ratio of funded debt to EBITDA before exceptional items according to a grid which varies, depending on leverage, from LIBOR plus 200bp to LIBOR plus 250bp.
At 30 April 2012 the Groups borrowing rate was LIBOR plus 225bp.
The ABL facility includes a springing covenant package under which quarterly financial performance covenants are tested only if available liquidity is less than 12% of the facility size $216m following the recent increase in the facility size to $1.8bn discussed above.
Available liquidity at 30 April 2012 pro-forma for the subsequent revision in facility size was 453m $735m reflecting drawings under the facility at that date together with outstanding letters of credit of 15m $25m, which meant that covenants were not measured at 30 April 2012 and are unlikely to be measured in forthcoming quarters.
As the ABL facility is asset-based, the maximum amount available to be borrowed which includes drawings in the form of standby letters of credit depends on asset values receivables, inventory, rental equipment and real estate which are subject to periodic independent appraisal.
The maximum amount that could be drawn under the enlarged facility at 30 April 2012 was 997m $1.6bn.
9% second priority senior secured notes due 2016 having a nominal value of $550m On 15 August 2006 the Group, through its wholly owned subsidiary Ashtead Capital, Inc. issued $550m of 9% second priority senior secured notes due 15 August 2016.
The notes are secured by second priority interests over substantially the same assets as the ABL facility and are also guaranteed by Ashtead Group plc.
Under the terms of the 9% notes the Group is, subject to important exceptions, restricted in its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, sell assets, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and merge or consolidate with another company.
Financial performance covenants under the 9% senior secured note issue are only measured at the time new debt is raised.
The effective rates of interest at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2012 2011 First priority senior secured bank debt revolving advances in dollars 2.5% 2.8% Secured notes $550m nominal value 9.0% 9.0% Finance leases 7.4% 7.8% 64 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 16 Obligations under finance leases Minimum Present value of lease payments minimum lease payments 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Amounts payable under finance leases: Less than one year 2.3 1.8 2.1 1.6 Later than one year but not more than five 1.9 1.5 1.7 1.4 4.2 3.3 3.8 3.0 Future finance charges 0.4 0.3 3.8 3.0 The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets disclosed in note 12.

The provision is established based on advice received from independent actuaries of the estimated total cost of the self-insured retained risk based on historical claims experience.
The amount charged in the year is stated net of a 2.5m adjustment to reduce the provision held at 1 May 2011.
The majority of the provision for vacant property costs is expected to be utilised over a period of up to three years.

At the balance sheet date, no temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries are considered to exist as UK tax legislation largely exempts overseas dividends received from UK tax.

66 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 20 Share-based payments The Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT facilitates the provision of shares under certain of the Groups share-based remuneration plans.
It holds a beneficial interest in 4,582,462 ordinary shares of the Company acquired at an average cost of 135.9p per share.
The shares had a market value of 11.4m at 30 April 2012.
The ESOT has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
The costs of operating the ESOT are borne by the Group but are not significant.
Outstanding options under discretionary share option plans were all exercised during the year and the schemes are now closed.
Details of the Performance Share Plan PSP are given on pages 41 and 42.
The costs of this scheme are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the award at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
In 2012, there was a net charge to pre-tax profit in respect of the PSP of 2.5m 2011: 1.6m.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 2.0m 2011: 1.0m.
The fair value of awards granted during the year is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: share price at grant date of 165p, nil exercise price, a dividend yield of 1.82%, volatility of 59.3%, a risk-free rate of 0.94% and an expected life of three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model is based on the terms of the plan.

22 Pensions The Group operates pension plans for the benefit of qualifying employees.
The major plans for new employees throughout the Group are all defined contribution plans following the introduction of the stakeholder pension plan for UK employees in May 2002.
Pension costs for defined contribution plans were 5.1m 2011: 1.6m.
The Group also has a defined benefit plan for UK employees which was closed to new members in 2001.
This plan is a funded defined benefit plan with trustee administered assets held separately from those of the Group.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 30 April 2010 and updated to 30 April 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The actuary is engaged by the Company to perform a valuation in accordance with IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuary were as follows: 2012 2011 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1% 3.2% Discount rate 4.8% 5.3% Ination assumption RPI 3.2% 3.4% CPI 2.2% 2.7% Weighted average expected return on plan assets 6.3% 6.5% Pensioner life expectancy assumed in the 30 April 2012 update is based on the S1PxA CMI 2011 projection model mortality tables adjusted so as to apply a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1.0% a year.
Samples of the ages to which pensioners are assumed to live are as follows: Male Female Pensioner aged 65 in 2012 87.0 89.2 Pensioner aged 65 in 2032 88.3 90.8 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Current service cost 0.5 0.6 Interest cost 3.0 3.5 Expected return on plan assets 4.2 3.7 Total cost 0.7 0.4 68 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fair value of plan assets 67.1 63.6 Present value of funded dened benefit obligation 63.5 57.5 Present value of unfunded dened benefit obligation 0.2 Net asset recognised in the balance sheet 3.4 6.1 Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations were as follows: 2012 2011 m m At 1 May 57.5 63.6 Current service cost 0.5 0.6 Interest cost 3.0 3.5 National Insurance rebates received 0.1 0.2 Contributions from members 0.3 0.3 Actuarial loss gain experience loss gain 1.0 2.4 change in assumptions 3.1 6.4 Benets paid 1.8 1.9 At 30 April 63.7 57.5 The actuarial loss in the year ended 30 April 2012 reflects the decrease in the discount rate caused by falling corporate bond yields in the year from 5.3% to 4.8% which increased the discounted value of the accrued defined benefit obligations, partially offset by a reduction in assumed future inflation and by the deficit contributions paid by the Company.
Movements in the fair value of plan assets were as follows: 2012 2011 m m At 1 May 63.6 55.9 Expected return on plan assets 4.2 3.7 Actual return on plan assets below above expected return 2.1 3.9 Contributions from sponsoring companies 2.8 1.5 National Insurance rebates received 0.1 0.2 Contributions from members 0.3 0.3 Benets paid 1.8 1.9 At 30 April 67.1 63.6 The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was as follows: Expected return Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 % % m m Equity instruments 7.3 7.3 45.2 38.8 Bonds 4.3 4.8 21.7 19.9 Property 7.3 7.3 4.8 Cash 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.1 6.3 6.5 67.1 63.6 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 22 Pensions continued The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns on each individual asset class.
The expected return on equities is the sum of inflation, the dividend yield and economic growth net of investment expenses.
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term gilts and bonds.

The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid by the Company to the plan during the current financial year is 1.4m.
23 Financial risk management The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
It is the role of the Group treasury function to manage and monitor the Groups financial risks and internal and external funding requirements in support of the Groups corporate objectives.
Treasury activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by the Board and monitored by the Finance and Administration Committee.
In particular, the Board of directors or, through delegated authority, the Finance and Administration Committee, approves any derivative transactions.
Derivative transactions are only undertaken for the purposes of managing interest rate risk and currency risk.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Group maintains treasury control systems and procedures to monitor liquidity, currency, credit and financial risks.
The Group reports and pays dividends in pounds sterling.
Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to interest rate and currency risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored on a continuous basis and managed, where appropriate, through the use of interest rate swaps whereas, the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to manage currency risk is considered on an individual non-trading transaction basis.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk or equity price risk as defined in IFRS 7.
Interest rate risk Management of fixed and variable rate debt The Group has fixed and variable rate debt in issue with 38% of the drawn debt at a fixed rate as at 30 April 2012.
The Groups accounting policy requires all borrowings to be held at amortised cost.
As a result the carrying value of fixed rate debt is unaffected by changes in credit conditions in the debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
The Groups debt that bears interest at a variable rate comprises all outstanding borrowings under the senior secured credit facility.
The interest rates currently applicable to this variable rate debt are LIBOR as applicable to the currency borrowed US dollars or pounds plus 225bp.
The Group periodically utilises interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates.
However, during the year ended and as at 30 April 2012, the Group had no such swap agreements outstanding.
The Group also may at times hold cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at a variable rate.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity At 30 April 2012, based upon the amount of variable rate debt outstanding, the Groups pre-tax profits would change by approximately 5.4m for each one percentage point change in interest rates applicable to the variable rate debt and, after tax effects, equity would change by approximately 3.2m.
The amount of the Groups variable rate debt may fluctuate as a result of changes in the amount of debt outstanding under the senior secured credit facility.
70 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Currency exchange risk Currency exchange risk is limited to translation risk as there are no transactions in the ordinary course of business that take place between foreign entities.
The Groups reporting currency is the pound sterling.
However, a majority of our assets, liabilities, revenue and costs are denominated in US dollars.
The Group has arranged its financing such that, at 30 April 2012, virtually all of its debt was denominated in US dollars so that there is a natural partial offset between its dollar-denominated net assets and earnings and its dollar-denominated debt and interest expense.
The Groups exposure to exchange rate movements on trading transactions is relatively limited.
All Group companies invoice revenue in their respective local currency and generally incur expense and purchase assets in their local currency.
Consequently, the Group does not routinely hedge either forecast foreign exchange exposures or the impact of exchange rate movements on the translation of overseas profits into sterling.
Where the Group does hedge, it maintains appropriate hedging documentation.
Foreign exchange risk on significant non-trading transactions e. g. acquisitions is considered on an individual basis.
Resultant impacts of reasonably possible changes to foreign exchange rates Based upon the level of US operations and of the US dollar-denominated debt balance and US interest rates at 30 April 2012, a 1% change in the US dollar-pound exchange rate would have impacted our pre-tax profits by approximately 1.3m and equity by approximately 3.7m.
At 30 April 2012, the Group had no outstanding foreign exchange contracts.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 2012 2011 m m Cash and cash equivalents 23.4 18.8 Trade and other receivables 178.0 155.3 201.4 174.1 Substantially all of the Groups cash and cash equivalents at 30 April 2012 are deposited with a large UK-based financial institution which is not expected to fail.
The Group has a large number of unrelated customers, serving almost 500,000 during the financial year, and does not have any significant credit exposure to any particular customer.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the markets they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across the Group, such as the use of credit reference agencies and the maintenance of credit control functions.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group generates significant free cash flow defined as cash flow from operations less replacement capital expenditure net of proceeds of asset disposals, interest paid and tax paid.
This free cash flow is available to the Group to invest in growth capital expenditure, acquisitions and dividend payments or to reduce debt.
In addition to the strong free cash flow from normal trading activities, additional liquidity is available through the Groups ABL facility.
At 30 April 2012, excess availability under this facility pro-forma for the $400m increase in June 2012 was $735m 453m.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial asset held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities, excluding trade and other payables which fall due within one year.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.

Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities The table below provides a comparison, by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the Groups non-derivative financial assets and liabilities at 30 April 2012.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and includes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values of financial assets and liabilities.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

Estimated additional consideration of US$1.9m 1.2m is expected to become payable later in 2012 by way of tax equalisation.
Topp is a specialist rental provider of air conditioning, heating and dehumidification equipment based in Philadelphia with 15 branches located principally in major cities across the United States.
Precision runs a small assembly and manufacturing facility in support of Topps business.
Topps revenue and operating loss in the period from the date of acquisition to 30 April 2012 were 0.5m $0.8m and 0.3m $0.5m respectively.
Had the acquisition taken place on 1 May 2011 then Group reported revenue and operating profit for the year ended 30 April 2012 would have been higher by 12.9m $20.6m and 2.9m $4.7m respectively.
The net assets acquired and the provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition are as follows: Acquirees At provisional book value fair value m m Net assets acquired Trade and other receivables 1.6 1.6 Inventory 1.1 1.1 Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.1 Property, plant and equipment rental equipment 1.5 2.4 other assets 0.7 0.7 Intangible assets brand name, distribution and non-compete agreements and customer relationships 10.5 Trade and other payables 1.2 1.2 3.8 15.2 Consideration: cash paid and payable 21.0 deferred consideration tax equalisation payable in cash 1.2 22.2 Goodwill 7.0 The goodwill arising can be attributed to the key management personnel and workforce of the acquired business and the benefits the Group expects to derive from the acquisition.
Subject to agreement and payment to the vendor of the tax equalisation charge, this goodwill will become deductible for tax purposes and has been treated as such.
Trade receivables at acquisition were 1.5m at fair value, net of 0.1m provision for debts which may not be collected, and had a gross face value of 1.6m.
74 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 26 Contingent liabilities Group The Group is subject to periodic legal claims in the ordinary course of its business, none of which is expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial position.
As previously reported, in spring 2011, following audits of the tax returns of the Groups US subsidiaries for the four years ended 30 April 2009, the US Internal Revenue Service IRS issued revised assessments and associated notices of interest and penalties arising from its proposed reclassification of certain US intercompany debt in those years from debt to equity and its consequent proposed recharacterisation of US interest payments to the UK as equity-like distributions.
The revised assessments would have resulted in additional net tax payments due of $31m together with interest and penalties of $15m.
We disagreed with these assessments and defended our position vigorously.
Sunbelt and its advisers recently reached a satisfactory preliminary agreement with the IRS Appeals team on these matters.
This preliminary agreement is expected to be documented and formally agreed following further internal review within the IRS during the coming fiscal year.
There was no significant impact on the 2012 financial statements as a result of the preliminary agreement and the Board does not anticipate these issues generating any material impact on the Groups future results or financial position.
The Company The Company has guaranteed the borrowings of its subsidiary undertakings under the Groups senior secured credit and overdraft facilities.
At 30 April 2012 the amount borrowed under these facilities was 545.7m 2011: 474.2m.
Subsidiary undertakings are also able to obtain letters of credit under these facilities and, at 30 April 2012, letters of credit issued under these arrangements totalled 15.3m $24.9m 2011: 16.1m or $26.8m.
In addition, the Company has guaranteed the 9% second priority senior secured notes with a par value of $550m 339m, issued by Ashtead Capital, Inc..
The Company has guaranteed operating and finance lease commitments of subsidiary undertakings where the minimum lease commitment at 30 April 2012 totalled 55.3m 2011: 59.5m in respect of land and buildings of which 6.8m is payable by subsidiary undertakings in the year ending 30 April 2013.
The Company has guaranteed the performance by subsidiaries of certain other obligations up to 1.0m 2011: 0.7m.
27 Capital commitments At 30 April 2012 capital commitments in respect of purchases of rental and other equipment totalled 265.3m 2011: 173.1m, all of which had been ordered.
There were no other material capital commitments at the year end.
28 Related party transactions The Groups key management comprise the Companys executive and non-executive directors.
Details of their remuneration together with their share interests and share option awards are given in the Directors remuneration report and form part of these financial statements.
29 Employees The average number of employees, including directors, during the year was as follows: 2012 2011 North America 6,444 5,600 United Kingdom 1,958 1,921 8,402 7,521 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 New accounting standards The Group has not adopted early the following pronouncements, which have been issued by the IASB or the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC, but have not yet been endorsed for use in the EU with the exception of Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements presentation of items of other comprehensive income and Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments was issued on 12 November 2009 and revised on 25 October 2010 and subsequent amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 were issued on 16 December 2011 and are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 with early adoption permitted.
The IASB has issued this standard as the first step in its project to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories being amortised cost and fair value.
All equity and debt instruments are to be measured at fair value with the exception of a debt instrument being measured at amortised cost if it is being held by the entity to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest.
The requirement to separate embedded derivatives from financial assets within hybrid contracts has been removed with them being classified in their entirety at either amortised cost or fair value.
Two of the existing three fair value option criteria being loans and receivables and held-tomaturity investments measured at amortised cost will become obsolete under this fair value-driven business model.
The EU has currently postponed its endorsement of this standard as its IFRS technical advisory body, the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group EFRAG has decided that more time should be taken to consider the output from the entire package of standards that are expected to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position on adoption.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements, which replaces parts of IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and all of SIC-12 Consolidation special purpose entities, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
As a consequence of the issuance of IFRS 10, IAS 27 has been amended and now contains requirements relating only to separate financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements which replaces IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures and SIC-13 Jointly controlled entities non-monetary contributions by venturers, requires a single method, known as the equity method, to account for interests in jointly controlled entities.
IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures, has been amended as a consequence of the issuance of IFRS 11.
In addition to prescribing the accounting for investment in associates, it now sets out the requirements for the application of the equity method when accounting for joint ventures.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities, is a new standard on disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The standard includes disclosure requirements for entities covered under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, provides guidance on how fair value should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRS, including a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS.
Amendments to IFRS 1 Severe hyperinflation and removal of fixed dates for first-time adopters was issued on 20 December 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
Amendments to IFRS 1 Government loans was issued on 13 March 2012 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This amendment addresses how a first-time adopter would account for a government loan with a below-market rate of interest when transitioning to IFRSs.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position on adoption.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities was issued on 16 December 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The amendment introduces new disclosure requirements for financial assets and liabilities that are offset in the balance sheet or subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements.
In addition, financial assets and liabilities netted off in the balance sheet must be disclosed as gross and net including the amount set off.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements presentation of items of other comprehensive income was issued on 16 June 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012.
This amendment reaffirms the 2007 amendment to allow profit or loss and other comprehensive income OCI to be presented either as a single statement of comprehensive income, or as separate statements.
It requires entities to group items presented in OCI based on whether they potentially could be reclassified to profit or loss subsequently i. e. those that might be reclassified and those that will not be reclassified.
It also requires tax associated with items presented before tax to be shown separately for each of the two groups of OCI items.
Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets was issued on 20 December 2010 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position on adoption.
76 Ashtead Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Amended IAS 19 Employee benefits was issued on 16 June 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012.
The amendment requires net interest to be calculated by multiplying the net defined benefit liability or asset by the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
It also requires the immediate recognition of changes including immediate recognition of defined benefit cost, disaggregation of defined benefit cost into components, recognition of remeasurements in OCI, plan amendments, curtailments and settlements in the net defined benefit liability or asset i. e. removing the corridor approach.
Options for presenting gains and losses have been eliminated by requiring companies to include service and finance cost in profit or loss and remeasurements in OCI.
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities was issued on 16 December 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014.
The amendment clarifies that offsetting is only permitted if the legally enforceable right is not contingent on a future event and is enforceable both in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the entity and all counterparties.
IFRIC Interpretation 20 Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine was issued on 19 October 2011 and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The interpretation clarifies when production stripping should lead to the recognition of an asset and how that asset should be measured, both initially and in subsequent periods.
The Group does not believe the adoption of this interpretation will have a material effect on the Groups results and financial position on adoption.
