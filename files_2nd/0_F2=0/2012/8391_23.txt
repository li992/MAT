Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting These accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The policies are consistent with the previous year except for the adoption of the following amended standards and new Urgent Issues Task Force UITF abstract: Improvements to Financial Reporting Standards 2010 UITF 47 IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The adoption of these annual improvements and the new UITF abstract has not had any material effect on the Financial Statements of the Company.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account for the year.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits For defined benefit plans, the service cost of providing retirement benefits to employees during the year is charged to operating profit or loss in the year.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The full cost of providing amendments to benefits in respect of past service that vests immediately is also charged to operating profit or loss in the year.
The net surplus or deficit on defined benefit pension schemes is reported on the balance sheet within the pension asset or liability.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown either as accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are held at cost less provisions for impairment where a permanent diminution in value has been identified.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Debt instruments Borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after deduction of issue costs.
The issue costs of debt instruments are amortised over the life of the instrument using the effective interest rate method.
Taxation Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different to those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred income tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payment The Company operates various equity-settled and cash-settled share schemes.
For equity-settled share options, the services received from employees are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date using a valuation model and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Market conditions are those conditions that are linked to the share price of the Company.
152 Invensys plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business Review Governance Group Financial Statements Parent Company Financial Statements Other Information For equity-settled share award schemes, the fair value is calculated based on the share price at the grant date and, where applicable, any market vesting conditions, and expensed over the vesting period based on the number of shares expected to vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition: which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
The financial effect of share options and awards over its equity shares granted to employees of subsidiary undertakings are recognised by the Company in its individual financial statements.
In particular, the Company records an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the FRS 20 cost in subsidiary undertakings.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
For cash-settled share awards, the services received from employees are measured at the fair value of the liability and recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement with changes in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements in FRS 20 IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the requirements of FRS 20 have not been applied to equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002 and those vesting before 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are re-acquired treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Treasury shares are purchased and held by the Employee Share Trust to meet future distributions of shares to employees under the Groups various share option and share award schemes.
Dividend income Revenue is recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.

com 155 Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued 9 Pensions and post-retirement benefits i Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Company operates one unfunded defined benefit pension scheme.
The last full valuation of the scheme on a FRS 17 IAS 19 basis has been updated to 31 March 2012, to reflect market conditions and material events in the plan.
The Company also participates in the Invensys Pension Scheme UK, which is the principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees.
The Invensys Pension Scheme UK is a funded defined benefit scheme.
However, the Company is unable to separately identify on a consistent and reasonable basis its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme to which it participates, mainly because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate information for disposed companies and the subjective nature of any allocation basis.
Therefore the Company accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme, in accordance with the provisions of FRS 17.
The scheme is currently in deficit on an IAS 19 basis using the projected credit actuarial valuation method to determine the schemes liabilities.
Details of the scheme, its deficit and its principle sensitivities are included in Note 25 to the Group Financial Statements in accordance with the accounting and disclosure requirements of IAS 19, which are generally equivalent to those of FRS 17.
Pension costs in respect of the Invensys Pension Scheme UK represented contributions payable in the year and amounted tonil 2011: nil.
At 31 March 2012, the outstanding contributions included in creditors were nil 2011: nil.

2 The inflation rate is based on RPI.
An additional inflation rate assumption for CPI of 2.50% is used to reflect the UK Governments change of the inflation measure used to determine minimum pension increases.
Standard SAPS actuarial mortality tables S1PA were adopted.
Based on Scheme experience, the probability of death at each age was multiplied by 103% for males and 113% for females.
Future improvements in life expectancy have been allowed for in line with the standard CMI model projections subject to a long term trend of 1.00% for males and 1.00% for females.

For all other participants: a 35% of an award is based on growth in the Companys TSR relative to the constituent companies of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index: and b 35% of an award is based on the CAGR in the Groups Earnings Per Share.
There are no performance conditions applying to the remaining 30% of an award.

Scheme use The 2007 LTIP is used as the Groups main share-based long-term incentive plan under which share awards are granted.
The first grants under this plan were made in the year ended 31 March 2008.
2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award was subject to a three-year performance period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period as detailed below.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there would be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent to upper quintile.
This was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retained discretion to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of the Company had been satisfactory.
In the case of the TSR performance target factors that would be taken into account included EPS growth and the Companys cash position.
Result of performance requirements for CEO Special Award With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3% ofthesecond layer of shares were available to vest.
Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicable following the announcement of the full-year results for 2009 10 and the balance was released following a 12-month period from the first release at 25 May 2010, on 26 May 2011.
With regard to the EPS part of the award 50%, after considering the 2009 10 audited financial results, the Remuneration Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject to the EPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed.
Service requirements: The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
The holder left the Company on 24 March 2011 and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining shares under the Special Award, that have now been released.

14 Deferred income tax assets Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it is probable that profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred income tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 31 million with a tax value of 7 million 2011: 28 million with a tax value of 7 million in respect of pension obligations.
The Company has unrecognised income tax losses of 51 million with a tax value of 12 million 2011: 51 million with a tax value of 13 million available for offset against future profits.
The Company has unrecognised capital losses of 50 million 2011: 50 million that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
These capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax has reduced to 24% from 1 April 2012 and is expected to continue to fall by 1% each year to 22% in 2014.
The impact of the rate change to 22% would reduce the total unrecognised deferred income tax assets by 3 million.
