Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Groups full year financial statements.
The Consolidated and Company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies accounts Act 199, the Gibraltar Companies ConsolidatedAccounts Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 as amended.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 will be led with Companies House, Gibraltar following the Companys Annual GeneralMeeting.
Due to the Merger in March 2011 which was treated as an acquisition by PartyGaming for accounting purposes, certain accounting policies that werenot previously relevant for the Group, but relevant for bwin, were adopted in these consolidated financial statements in the prior year.
All other material accounting policies and presentations of bwin were also aligned to those of the enlarged Group in the prior year.
Adoption of new and revised Standards and Interpretations The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no effect on its consolidated results or financial position: IAS 12 Amended Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB or the IFRIC before the period end but are as yet not effective for the 2012year end: IAS 1 Amended Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 IAS 19 Amended Employee Bene ts effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Amended Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IAS 28 Amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IAS 32 Amended Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January2013 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Initial application of IFRS 9 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 Not yet endorsed by the EU.
The Group is currently assessing the impact, if any, that these standards will have on the presentation of, and recognition in its consolidated results infuture periods.

Accounting policies continued Basis of accounting The Consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies andreported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which havea signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows: Revenue recognition note 1 Tax including deferred tax note 8 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 11 Provisions note 20 Regulatory compliance, litigation and contingent liabilities note 24 Acquisition accounting and value of acquired assets and liabilities and contingent consideration payable note 27 Disposal accounting and contingent consideration receivable note 28 Share-based payments note 31 Basis of consolidation Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in bwin.
party Holdings Limited formerly PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, bwin.
party Holdings Limited formerly PartyGaming Holdings Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Accounting for subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identi ed separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholders share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a fide cit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 102 1.
Accounting policies continued Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identi able assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identi able assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
The choice of measurement basis is made on an  basis.
Investments Investments include investments in associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments.
Available-for-sale investments Non-derivative financial assets classi ed as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
In accordance with IAS 39, a signi cant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has signi cant in uence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Signi cant in uence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the Consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for postacquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of an associate inexcess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Investments in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control: that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the netassets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in that investment are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal orconstructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Identi able intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic bene ts attributed to the asset will ow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identi able assets acquired in the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Anyimpairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separate from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
Identi able assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identi ed intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead tonew or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has suf cient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion ofoverheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic bene ts to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, over the periods the Group expects to bene t from their use, and varies between: Brand and domain names 5% to 20% per annum Broadcast libraries 50% per annum Capitalised development expenditure 20% to 33% per annum Contractual relationships over the length of the contract Customer lists and contracts 5% to 50% per annum Intellectual property and gaming licences over the length of the licence Software 20% to 33% per annum Notes to the consolidated financial statements 104 1.
Accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment At the end of each reporting year, an impairment review of goodwill is completed.
In addition, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit towhich the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an inde nite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset iscarried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and buildings which are stated at cost and are not depreciated.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold land and buildings, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, ttings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items ofproperty, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item is accounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic bene ts to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.

Accounting policies continued Segment information An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses.
Each segments operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating segments within the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
The Group reviews financial statements presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising sports betting, casino & games, poker, bingo, and network services third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees.
Poker net gaming revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament less certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Casino, bingo and sports betting net gaming revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, third-party payment services, sale of domain names, financial markets, software services and fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions.
Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of betting and gaming taxes and broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable lifecycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current years revenue to the estimated remaining total revenues.
Other operating income Other operating income consists primarily of exchange gains.
Other operating expenses Other operating expenses consist primarily of exchange losses and merger and acquisition costs and are recognised on an accruals basis.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 106 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated atthe rates ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are recognised immediately in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of anet investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into euros at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity the currency reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of group entities separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassi ed to the currency reserve onconsolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation up to the date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable pro t for the year.
Taxable pro t differs from pro t as reported in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year.

Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding taxbases used in the computation of taxable pro t. It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains speci c exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable pro ts will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable pro t nor the accounting pro t. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that suf cient taxable pro ts will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to pro t or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classi ed as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classi cation.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
Theexpected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of the liability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 108 1.
Accounting policies continued Own shares Own shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company.
The cash cost of own shares creates an own share reserve.
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based on proceeds less weighted-average cost of shares initially purchased now exercised.
Own shares repurchased in cash as part of the share buy-back programme are debited to reserves.
The shares are cancelled at nominal value with acorresponding entry taken to the capital redemption reserve.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the Consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out ow of economic bene ts will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an out ow of economic bene ts, no provision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of out ow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cash ows at a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks speci c to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classi ed as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Allother leases are classi ed as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Consolidated statement of nancialposition as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so asto achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bene ts received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Accounting policies continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered to be restricted cash.
There are no financial assets that are classi ed as held to maturity.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2012 or 31 December 2011.
Non-derivative financial assets classi ed as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
In accordance with IAS39, a signi cant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, which are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or signi cant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all ofthe amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cash ows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months orless.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance of the liability carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments as at 31December 2012 or 31 December 2011.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the fide nition of a financial liability.
TheGroups ordinary shares are classi ed as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Retroactive taxes and associated charges During the year, the Spanish Tax Authority contacted all of the major online gaming operators and made clear that, in their opinion, any online operator that has ever accepted customers from Spain has an obligation to pay Spanish taxes under two laws, one dating from 1966 and the other from 1977.
Previously these laws were applied to operators based in Spain carrying out of ine gaming activities and to certain kinds of bets other than xed odd bets.
As a result, like a number of other operators, a group company completed a tax self-assessment in accordance with the Spanish Tax Authoritys requirements and made a payment of 25.6m in respect of periods prior to June 2011.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The Groups policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered.
At the period end there were Group companies registered in 24 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial statements.
Factors that may affect future tax charges As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of pro tability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles.

The value of acquired intangibles is based on cash ow projections at the time of acquisition.
Customer lists from existing customers take into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
Licences are amortised overthe life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
The 391.7m impairment of goodwill in 2011 related to uncertainty created by certain proposed regulatory changes in Europe, particularly those in Germany.
The Directors applied probability weighted forecasts to determine the cash ow projections for this CGU which had an adverse impact on the projected value in use of this operation and consequently resulted in this impairment.
The 15.3m impairment of acquired intangibles in 2011 relates to software acquired as part of the Merger that will not be used for its normal economiclife.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 118 11.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units CGUs.
The CGUs have been changed to re ect the product verticals which management uses to segment the business: 2012 2011 As at 31 December million million Sports 98.0 96.4 Casino & games 67.4 66.2 Poker 13.4 12.3 Bingo 74.8 72.6 Other 14.2 At end of year 267.8 247.5 Impairment In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 2012 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cash ows derived from those assets.
Therecoverable amounts of all the above CGUs have been determined from value in use calculations based on cash ow projections from formally approved budgets and long-range forecasts.
Casino & games, Poker, Bingo and Other In respect of the Casino & games, Poker, Bingo and Other CGUs, the Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
The major assumptions used are asfollows: Key assumptions used in the projections Discount Operating Growth CGU rate margin rate Casino & Games 8.9% 21.4% 2.0% Poker 8.9% 21.4% 0.0% Bingo 8.9% 21.4% 5.3% Other 8.9% 21.4% 3.3% Sports The uncertainty created by the proposed regulatory changes in Europe, particularly those in Germany, have resulted in the Directors applying probability weighted forecasts to determine the cash ow projections for this CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Sports CGU has been determined from value in use calculations based on cash ow projections covering the following ten year period.
The Group believes that going beyond five years cash ows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established business and is a market leader in a growth industry.
Operating margins have been based on past experience and future expectations in light of anticipated economic and market conditions.
Discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted to re ect managements assessment of speci c risks related to the CGU.

Contingent liabilities From time to time the Group is subject to legal claims and actions against it.
The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of such claims and actions.
As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the business and takes appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Group companies may be subject to VAT on transactions which have been treated as exempt supplies of gambling, or on supplies which have been zero rated for export to Gibraltar where legislation provides that the services are received or used and enjoyed in the country where the services provider islocated.
No such amounts have been recognised as liabilities at the end of the reporting period.
In the view of the Directors no valid claims are outstanding in respect of these contingent liabilities.
Revenues earned from customers located in a particular jurisdiction may give rise to further taxes in that jurisdiction.
If such taxes are levied, either on the basis of current law or the current practice of any tax authority, or by reason of a change in the law or practice, then this may have a material adverse effect on the amount of tax payable by the Group.
Litigation As a consequence of the as yet non-harmonised regulatory environment for online gaming in Europe, a number of civil and administrative proceedings are pending against the Group and or its Board members in several countries including but not limited to Germany, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain aimed at preventing bwin.
party from offering its services in these countries.
Further, there are criminal proceedings pending against the Group and or certain Board members for the alleged violation of local gaming laws such as in France and Belgium.
In 2010, a former bwin subsidiary was assessed by Austrian tax authorities to have value-added tax arrears of 6.4m for the years 2002 to 2004.
The assessments were appealed and overruled by a decision of the Independent Finance Senate in 2012.
Subsequent periods are still under audit.
Although it is now likely that the arguments used in the overruled assessments will be dropped, the value of the worst case scenario amounts to 187.4million.
In 2006, the Portuguese monopoly operator Santa Casa fide Misericrdia da Lisboa SCML and the Portuguese Casino Association APC initiated proceedings for damages in the amount of approximately 27m against the former bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, bwin International Ltd and the Portuguese Soccer League LPFP.
On 13 July 2012, the Oporto Court of First Instance rejected SCMLs claim for damages.
SCML did not le an appeal and the decision on SCMLs claim for damages is thus final and the case has therefore closed.
In September 2011, the Court of First Instance, amongst others, i declared the already terminated sponsorship agreement between bwin.
party and the LPFP as illegal, ii declared bwin.
partys gaming offer and advertising measures as illegal in Portugal, iii prohibited bwin.

party will le an appeal against this decision to the Portuguese Supreme Court of Justice in due course.
In June 2012, APC led enforcement motions against LPFP and bwin.
party for alleged non-compliance with the decision of September 2011 requesting the payment of penalties.
These motions were rejected by the Court of First Instance and are currently pending before the Appellate Court.
party is of the view that it has taken the necessary steps to comply with the judgement of the Court of First Instance.
Itcannot be excluded, however, that such steps are held to be insuf cient by a competent court while bwin.
partys and LPFPs appeal is pending.
TheCompany continues to dispute its liability under the relevant statutes and intends to continue vigorously with its defence.
In July 2012, the Spanish gaming operator Codere led an unfair competition complaint against various bwin.
Prior to thiscomplaint the Spanish Court rejected Coderes request for a preliminary injunction.
Very similar to the complaint led by Santa Casa in Portugal whichhas been dismissed in July 2012, the complaint led by Codere seeks damages and prejudicial consequences in the amount of approximately 25m.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 126 24.
Contingent liabilities continued In 2010, the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky led a civil suit against the former PartyGaming Plc and other defendants in Franklin Circuit Court, a state court in Kentucky in the US.
The suit seeks a claim for damages related to the sums lost by Kentucky residents on PartyGamings sites during the period of 5 August 2005 until PartyGamings termination of US-facing activities on 13 October 2006.
On22February 2013, the Court issued an order against the former PartyGaming Plc granting summary judgment on liability.
The order has the effect ofestablishing liability and leaving open solely an assessment on quantum of damages.
The method of calculation of damages is entirely uncertain given the plaintiffs attempts to apply of ine wagering legislation to online poker and casino games.
Nonetheless, the Companys best estimation ofthe total net amount lost by Kentucky residents during the period in question is between US$2m and US$16m with the applicable legislation purportedly permitting the award of up to three times such sum.
The Company continues to dispute its liability and the quantum under the relevant statutes and intends to continue vigorously with its defence both before the circuit court and, if necessary, through any appellate channels.
In 2011, Ante 5 which has since changed its name to Blackridge Oil & Gas, Inc led a complaint and a request for arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service Inc. against the Company for the alleged breach of its obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement for the purchase of theWorld Poker Tour.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement Ante 5 was entitled to a 5% share of WPTs revenues since the acquisition in 2009.
Ante 5 claimed that the Company had not invested suf cient effort to market the WPT assets and had thus suffered loss in its revenue share.
Ante 5 sought recovery ofthe revenue that it believed it would have received were the Company to have acted diligently in the promotion of the WPT assets.
Thematter was settled further to mediation and the parties entered into a settlement agreement on 27 September 2012.
Under the settlement agreement Ante 5 agreed to drop all claims against the Company.
As a separate part of the agreement Ante 5 sold its right to the 5% revenue participation see note 27.
There are therefore no further liabilities stemming from this claim.
party digital entertainment plc and a subsidiary, PartyGaming IA Ltd. were named as defendants in an action now pending in the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, entitled Yessenia Sof n, et al.
party digital entertainment plc, et al.
Theplaintiffs have alleged tortious interference with business relationship, civil conspiracy, violations of Fl.
501.204 1 FDUPTA, and violations of the Lanham Act, 15 U. S. C. 1125, related to the defendants efforts to prevent infringement of the PartyPoker trademark by plaintiffs Party Star Poker gaming brand.
The plaintiffs allege that they have sustained damages in excess of US$25m.
The Company continues to dispute its liability under the relevant statutes and intends to continue vigorously with its defence.
In respect of the above matters relating to former bwin companies, IFRS 3 requires that a probability-weighted estimate is used for fair-valuing acquired contingent liabilities and a provision made accordingly, even though had the same contingent liability arisen in a former PartyGaming company no provision would be made under IAS 37.

Cash consideration of $17.25m 13.7m was paid with contingent consideration of up to $2.6m 2.3m payable subject to certain performance conditions being met.
The Group has determined the fair value of contingent consideration taking into account the probability ofexpected outcomes and appropriate discount rates.

Financial instruments and risk management The Group is exposed through its operations to the following financial risks: Liquidity risk Capital risk Credit risk Market risk Interest rate risk Currency risk In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect ofthese risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
party Annual report & accounts 2012 Overview Strategy Review Markets Responsibility & Board of Governance Financial Share Notice of Annual Glossary of 2012 and risks relationships Directors statements Information General Meeting 131 30.
Financial instruments and risk management continued There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: investments: short-term investments: trade and other receivables: cash and cash equivalents: loans and borrowings: trade and other payables: client liabilities and progressive prize pools: and foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2012 or at the prior year end.
The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets.
As at 31 December 2012 and at the prior year end the fair market value ofopen bets was not material.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the period ended 31 December 2012 or in the prior year.
Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation ofthe objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
Nootherderivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which arerecommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies wouldalso be reviewed by the Board following, for example, signi cant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported tomanagement on a monthly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
The last internal control review wasundertaken during 2011 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and exibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter dif culty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is fide ned as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts duefrom PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of 200m 2011: 300m that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no signi cant concentration of re nancing risk.
This limit was reduced in 2012 to re ect greater uncertainties in regulatory markets.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that suf cient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
In December 2012 the Group entered into a 37m term loan as a means of managing liquidity risk.
The term loan was fully drawn as at 31 December 2012 and is repayable by December 2015.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements 132 30.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, the Groups policy is that gross debt should not exceed 400m 2011: 500m and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
The gross debt limit was reduced in 2012 to re ect greater uncertainties in regulatory markets.
An analysis of gross debt is as follows: 2012 2011 As at 31 December million million Gross debt million 37.0 33.2 Clean EBITDA million 164.9 155.2 Headroom million 210.4 232.8 Ratio 0.2 0.1 Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed in the Chairmans statement and also on page 43 of this Annual report under the heading Reviewof2012.
Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their statement of financial position, pro tability, customer diversi cation, geographic diversi cation, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of veisassessed as weak.
2012 2011 As at 31 December million million 1 Very Strong 39.7 42.5 2 Strong 22.1 12.3 3 Good 5.3 4.7 4 Satisfactory 3.4 2.7 PSPs amounts due 70.5 62.2 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
As at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts or any impairment expense for the period.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs.
Note 15 details the movement and level of provisions for PSPs.
Cash investments: As a result of the deteriorating European financial situation, in October 2011 the Group decided to only invest cash with banks on overnight basis with a small number of very strong German and English financial institutions.
The Group also invests cash in instant access pooled money market funds with a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as fide ned by Moodys rating agency.
The Group can also purchase commercial paper provided the issuer is not a financial institution and has a one-year credit default swap, as quoted by Bloomberg, ofnomore than 1%.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with strong local banks in Israel, Bulgaria, Austria, USA and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
In Italy, Spain and France the Group maintains domestic segregated player funds accounts as required by the respective regulatory authorities.
Cash is also held as security in Austria, Italy and UK primarily to support bank guarantees and as reserves for credit and debit card chargebacks.
Other than this, non-central cash balances are kept to a minimum.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value offuture cash ows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes ininterest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk The Groups current net cash position is maintained primarily on a oating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.
Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically and fully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some orall of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cash ows are hedged.
The Group may also economically hedge material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a monthly basis.
A 5m currency tolerance limit between euros and US dollar, sterling and Canadian dollar reduced to 3m between euro and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the exibility to hold debt in currencies other than euros in order to hedge non-Euro investments up to 50%of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups earnings of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December.
The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds signi cant amounts of cash at oating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet client liability obligations that are non-interest bearing.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the euro, arising out of changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are held in non-euro currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely changein isolation.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that speci ed changes occur.
Actualresults in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause uctuations ininterest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered asaprojection of likely future events and losses.

The threshold for vesting at which 25% will vest, would have been TSR equalling the median of the comparator group, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if the Companys TSR exceeded the median by 10% per annum calculated over the three-year period.
It is estimated that outperformance of the median by 10% per annum over that period is performance in excess of the upper quartile.
As part of the Merger, the Remuneration Committee measured the TSR performance condition up to the date of the EGM and determined the number of shares capable of vesting.
Vesting will still occur on the original vesting dates subject to continued employment.
No new awards are to be granted under this plan.
Value creation plan VCP Participants are granted VCP points, being a right to receive shares in the form of a nil-cost option or a conditional share award with a value equal totheir allocated percentage of the VCP pool.
The size of the VCP pool will be linked to the value created for shareholders, taking into account the increase in share price, dividends paid and share buy-backs, over three one-year performance periods, in excess of a hurdle amount 10% annual growth.
The VCP pool will be calculated as being equal to 4% of the increase in the Companys share price during the relevant year.
After each year end the VCP pool will be converted into awards over a speci c number of shares using the market value of a share at the relevant measurement date and in accordance with the participants allocated share of the VCP pool.
The awards will be structured as nil-cost share options, with half of the shares under each option vesting at the end of the third performance period and the remaining half vesting one year later.
As nil-cost options, they will remain exercisable for ten years from the date of grant.
As at 31 December 2012 the liability associated with the VCP was nil 2011: nil.
