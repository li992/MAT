Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 LQDQFLDOV Notes to the Financial Statements $FFRXQWLQJ SROLFLHV URXS DQG &RPSDQ &RUSRUDWH LQIRUPDWLRQ Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Scotland under the Companies Act 2006.
%DVLV RI SUHSDUDWLRQ The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2011.
The set of financial statements included in this annual report have been prepared on a going concern basis as the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
6WDWHPHQW RI FRPSOLDQFH The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
&KDQJHV LQ SUHVHQWDWLRQ DQG GLVFORVXUHV The Directors have made certain presentational and classification changes to the income statement in this annual report.
The Group has opted to present its Income Statement for the year ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011 in a three-column format.
Such presentation allows non-trading and exceptional items to be presented separately in the middle column of the Income Statement.
The various line items of the Income Statement are therefore shown both before and after these items in the first and last columns, respectively.
This allows shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the current year, so as to facilitate comparison with the prior year.
The Group has made a classification change with regards to the allocation of items between cost of sales and administrative expenses.
This change has been undertaken in order to achieve a more appropriate presentation.
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, the 31 March 2011 comparative figures have been restated to reflect this change.
The impact of this change was a reduction to cost of sales and an increase to administrative expenses of 4.9m.
There is no impact on the overall profitability or equity of the Group and consequently a third balance sheet has not been presented.
The comparative figures in respect of certain income statement disclosure items have been restated as a result of the misstatements identified.
Total remuneration of employees has reduced from 182.4m to 171.6m, employee numbers have reduced from 4,246 to 4,020, operating lease costs have increased from 17.6m to 20.0m and repairs and maintenance expenditure has reduced from 44.5m to 40.9m.
These changes have no impact on the primary statements, overall profitability or equity of the Group.
LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 $GRSWLRQ RI QHZ DQG UHYLVHG DFFRXQWLQJ VWDQGDUGV DQG LQWHUSUHWDWLRQV The Group has adopted in the year the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations which are mandatory for the first time for the Groups financial year beginning 1 April 2011: Accounting Standard Requirement Impact on financial statements IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures The key amendments were: The adoption of the amendment by the Group has had no material impact.

The following revisions to IFRS will be applicable in future periods: IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in June 2011 but the amendments are not applicable until 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement.
The impact on the Group will be to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendment.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 which will impact the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2014, subject to EU endorsement.
Given the Group has a number of joint ventures which are currently proportionately consolidated it is possible that the standard will have a material impact on the Groups reporting as this will no longer be permitted.
Full details of the Groups interest in joint ventures are shown in note 15.
It is anticipated that the adoption of the following amendments to standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the Groups reported results or financial position: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 2010 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.

The Group continues to monitor the potential impact of other new standards and interpretations which may be endorsed by the European Union and require adoption by the Group in future accounting periods.
%DVLV RI FRQVROLGDWLRQ The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity in order to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements by proportional consolidation.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest under a contractual arrangement where the Group and one or more other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Subsidiary companies set up under PFI PPP contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost or, in the case of a disposal of the majority shareholding, fair value.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
An associate is an entity, other than a subsidiary or joint venture, over which the Group LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 has significant influence.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating decisions of an entity but is not in control or joint control over those policies.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a Group company transacts with a joint venture or associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant joint venture or associate.
%XVLQHVV FRPELQDWLRQV The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Revised, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The fair value of businesses acquired may include customer lists, these are recognised as intangible assets, the value is calculated by discounting the future revenue stream attributable to these lists or relationships and they are amortised.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
5HYHQXH UHFRJQLWLRQ Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of consideration received or receivable, including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes, discounts and inter-company sales, for goods and services provided in the normal course of business.
Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the goods and services have been provided to the customer.
Income from electricity generated from gas produced by waste processes at landfill sites and anaerobic digestion facilities includes an estimation of the amount to be received.
Revenue from the sale of recyclate materials is recognised, based on contractually agreed prices, when the risks and rewards have passed to the buyer, can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is probable.
Accrued income Accrued income is recognised at the fair value based on contractually agreed prices: it is subsequently invoiced and accounted for as a trade receivable.
PFI PPP contracts The Groups PFI PPP contracts are either integrated or residual waste management contracts.
The contracts require the building of new infrastructure and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.
The Group splits the local authority payment between a service element as revenue and a repayment element that is deducted from the financial asset.
Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments.
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life.
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement.
Bid costs are expensed in the Income Statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability that a contract will be awarded.
Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables.
When the contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
Win fees are transferred to deferred income upon financial close and released to the Income Statement over the period of construction of the infrastructure.
Unprocessed waste The deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value and processing cost.
Where there is a significant delay between the acceptance of waste and its final disposal then profit may be recognised in advance of final disposal over the period of delay provided the outcome of the waste treatment process is certain.
Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to the Income Statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 LQDQFLDOV Notes to the Financial Statements continued $FFRXQWLQJ SROLFLHV URXS DQG &RPSDQ continued Interest Interest is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking account of the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity, when it is determined that such income will accrue to the Group.
'HIHUUHG FRQVLGHUDWLRQ Deferred consideration is provided for at the net present value NPV of the Groups expected cost or receipt at the date of acquisition or disposal.
The likelihood of payment for deferred consideration conditional on meeting certain performance targets is considered on acquisition or disposal.
For acquisitions after 1 April 2010, any differences between consideration accrued and consideration paid or received are charged or released to the Income Statement, before this date differences are adjusted through goodwill.
QWDQJLEOH DVVHWV Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
Landfill void When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired and is amortised over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis.
Other intangibles Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use.
These are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis, as follows: Computer software 1 to 5 years Acquisition related intangibles: Waste permits and licences 5 to 20 years Others including customer lists 5 to 10 years Impairment of assets Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense.
3URSHUW SODQW DQG HTXLSPHQW Property, plant and equipment, except for freehold land, is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Buildings, plant and machinery Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and machinery lives are as follows: Computer equipment 1 to 5 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years As required under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, the Directors have undertaken a review of the residual value and the useful life of the Groups Property, Plant and Equipment as at 31 March 2012.
As a result of this review, the Group has revised upwards the estimated useful life of elements of Plant and Machinery with effect from 1 April 2012.
As this is a change in accounting estimate the impact will be accounted for prospectively.
Landfill sites Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
HDVHG DVVHWV Finance leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in payables.
Depreciation is provided to write down the assets over the shorter of the expected useful life and the lease term.
Operating leases All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 30 to the accounts.
QYHVWPHQWV LQ VXEVLGLDU XQGHUWDNLQJV Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost in the Companys balance sheet, less any provision for impairment in value.
QYHQWRULHV Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
3URYLVLRQV Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the net present value, NPV, of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the site.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites and mineral extraction sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited or mineral extracted in the year.
Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at the Groups landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the Income Statement and not charged to the provision.
Other provisions Other provisions are recognised when a present legal or constructive obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and it is probable that this will result in an outflow of resources, the amount of which can be estimated reliably.
Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 LQDQFLDOV Notes to the Financial Statements continued $FFRXQWLQJ SROLFLHV URXS DQG &RPSDQ continued Discounting All long-term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
PSOR HH EHQHILWV Retirement benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the Income Statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they become due.
The Group participates in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands.
These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based awards to certain employees.
The fair value of share-based awards is determined at the date of grant and expensed based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, save for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.
7D[DWLRQ Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 RUHLJQ FXUUHQFLHV Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Groups exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary undertaking is disposed of.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Closing rates Average rates 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March Value of 1 2012 2011 Change 2012 2011 Change Euro 1.20 1.13 6.2% 1.16 1.17 1.5 % Canadian Dollar 1.60 1.56 2.4% 1.59 1.56 1.7% The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the Income Statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
LQDQFLDO LQVWUXPHQWV Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated initially at their fair value.
The carrying amount of trade receivables is reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial assets in PFI PPP contracts Financial assets in PFI PPP contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less.
Where the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset with a financial institution, then bank overdrafts are offset against the cash balances.
External borrowings Interest bearing loans and bonds are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated initially at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group only holds or issues derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups exposure to financial risk, not for trading or speculative purposes.
Such financial risk includes: Interest risk on the Groups variable-rate borrowings: Fair value risk on the Groups fixed-rate borrowings: Commodity risk in relation to diesel consumption and recyclate prices: and Foreign exchange risk on transactions.
The Group manages these risks through a range of derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, fuel derivatives, forward foreign exchange contracts and contingent forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate swaps entered into before 31 March 2009 are measured at fair value at each reporting date with gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement.
Interest rate swaps entered into after 31 March 2009 are considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines.
Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 LQDQFLDOV Notes to the Financial Statements continued $FFRXQWLQJ SROLFLHV URXS DQG &RPSDQ continued At the inception of the hedge relationship the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the Income Statement when the hedged cash flow impacts the Income Statement.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs at which point it is recognised in the Income Statement.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the Income Statement immediately.
Details of the fair values of the derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in note 16.
Other receivables and other payables Other receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to accounts receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments.
'LYLGHQGV Dividend distributions to the equity holders are recognised in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
6HJPHQWDO UHSRUWLQJ The Groups organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada.
LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012.
H DFFRXQWLQJ MXGJHPHQWV DQG HVWLPDWHV The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if these are also affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: 8QGHUO LQJ EXVLQHVV SHUIRUPDQFH The Group believes that trading profit, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit after tax, underlying free cash flow, underlying earnings per share and EBITDA provide useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The terms trading profit, exceptional items and underlying are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measurements of profit.
The term underlying refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, excluding landfill void and computer software.
Trading profit is defined as continuing operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations are set out in note 4.
1RQ WUDGLQJ DQG H[FHSWLRQDO LWHPV Items classified as non-trading and exceptional are disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
These include, but are not limited to, significant impairments and the profit or loss on disposal of properties.
3, 333 FRQWUDFWV Financial assets are recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12.
They represent the present value of the future cash flows of the contract.
These cash flows are dependent on, amongst other things, tonnages, indexation, recycling rates and labour costs.
PSDLUPHQW RI LQWDQJLEOH DVVHWV In conducting the impairment review on goodwill and intangibles, management is required to make estimates of discount rates, future profitability, growth rates and tax rates.
Detailed descriptions of assumptions and values are given in note 13.
3URYLVLRQV Restoration and aftercare provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Groups restoration and aftercare provisions.
A discount is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision.
Provisions also include the present value of the estimated operating losses on loss making contracts.
Further information is set out in note 25.
5HWLUHPHQW EHQHILW VFKHPHV The Group operates defined benefit schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with managements best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation.
The principal assumptions in connection with the Groups retirement benefit schemes are set out in note 26.
7D[DWLRQ The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada, all of which have their own tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the current tax rate which may not be the tax rate at which they unwind.
The Group has available tax losses, some of which have been recognised as a tax asset and some have not based on managements best estimate of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses.

Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 LQDQFLDOV Notes to the Financial Statements continued 6HJPHQWDO UHSRUWLQJ Operating segments are based on the reports provided to the Board of Directors, the chief operating decision-maker.
The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK and Canada.
Each geographical location can be analysed according to the following types of activity: Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer, recycling and treatment Hazardous Waste Principally contaminated waste including industrial cleaning, transport, treatment including contaminated soils and disposal and contaminated land remediation Organics Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic waste streams UK Municipal - PFI PPP Contracts Long-term UK municipal waste treatment contracts Landfill and Power Landfill disposal including contaminated soils and power generation from landfill gas Sand Quarry Mineral extraction In addition to the waste activities detailed above, the Group has small infrastructure and groundworks operations in Belgium and the Netherlands which, due to their small size, are reported as part of the Solid Waste activities.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that the pension expense for the UK is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan.
The profit measure the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit.

This was a result of difficulties in the construction of a biomass plant and changes in market conditions.
The charge was the net impact of an impairment of a loan of 1.8m and deconsolidation of net assets of 0.2m including land and buildings, bank loans and derivatives.
A gain of 1.6m 2011: nil has been recognised following the reassessment and settlement of contingent consideration in relation to an acquisition made in the UK in the year ended 31 March 2011.
Changes in market conditions in the volumes delivered to and prices achieved in our small UK joint venture landfill have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of 2.5m.
The prior year impairment charge of 11.9m arose from changes in market conditions in wood based and landfill markets in Belgium and the Netherlands.
In the prior year the Group recognised an exceptional gain of 3.7m net of associated taxes arising from the 24.6m sale of all of the subordinated debt and 80% of the equity in the East London Waste Authority and Dumfries and Galloway PFI contracts.
An exceptional tax credit of 8.5m arose due to the partial release of provisions booked in March 2009 in respect of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances relating to these contracts.
With effect from 31 March 2011, the Group introduced a pensionable pay increase cap of 1% per annum that applies to the benefit that active non-local government section members can accrue in the scheme.
This led to an exceptional credit of 3.9m in the prior year.
The exceptional tax credit of 5.2m in the current period related to a favourable judgement issued with regard to certain tax liabilities in Belgium.

Expected volatility has been calculated using average volatility historical data over a five year period from the grant date.
The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield of zero-coupon government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life.
The expected life used in the models equals the vesting period as employees are expected to receive their vested shares on vesting or soon after vesting.

LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 RRGZLOO LPSDLUPHQW Impairment testing is carried out at cash generating unit CGU level on an annual basis.
A summary of goodwill by geographical area is presented below: 2012 2011 m m Netherlands 202.4 212.8 Belgium 13.6 14.4 UK 16.3 18.8 232.3 246.0 A significant part of the goodwill, 135.9m 2011: 144.3m, relates to the acquisition of the original business in the Netherlands in 2000.
The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting cash flows for the next five years from the annual strategy review together with a terminal value using a growth rate.
Management determined the five year plan based on past performance and its expectation of market developments.
All pre-tax cash flows are discounted at a pre-tax rate of 10%-11% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
As most CGUs have integrated operations across large parts of the Group this is considered appropriate for all parts of the business.
The following rates are used: Post-tax discount rate 7% 2011: 8%.
Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of 10%11%.
Growth rate used in the annuity is 2% 2011: 2%.
This does not exceed the long-term economic average growth of the countries that the Group operates in.
The valuations indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
PSDLUPHQW ORVVHV During the year there have been changes in market conditions in the volumes delivered to and prices achieved in our small UK joint venture landfill site and as a result there has been an impairment to the associated goodwill of 2.5m.
No class of asset other than goodwill was impaired.
In the prior year, the Group recognised an impairment provision of 11.9m in relation to the Netherlands and Belgium Solid Waste businesses.
The net impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional administrative expenses, in respect of goodwill and intangibles were as follows: 2012 2011 m m Netherlands Solid Waste 7.9 Belgium Solid Waste 4.0 UK Landfill 2.5 2.5 11.9 There is no residual goodwill of the UK CGU after impairing the goodwill, there is residual goodwill of 14.2m 2011: 15.1m and 0.2m 2011: 0.2m in the Netherlands and Belgian CGUs respectively after impairing the goodwill to its recoverable amount in the prior year.

The intangible assets acquired were permits, the brand and a customer list totalling 0.8m.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired has been recognised as goodwill representing the opportunity to access the glass recycling market.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 8.0m 2011: 6.3m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 11.5m 2011: 9.9m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries.
This is because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.
As mentioned in note 9 there was an exceptional tax credit of 5.2m in the current period relating to a favourable judgement issued with regard to certain tax liabilities in Belgium.
Following this decision, current and deferred tax balances have been reviewed and appropriately classified to reflect all remaining tax assets and liabilities.

The fair values of the retail bond and senior notes are measured by discounting the future cash flows using observable market interest rate information as no similar instrument is available due to the specific profiles of the instruments.
They are considered to be level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and fuel derivatives are determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable period-end yield curve.
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk.
The Group considers that the fair value of bank overdrafts and loans, trade and other payables and finance lease obligations are not materially different to their carrying value.
The fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than one year and as a current asset or liability when the remaining maturity is less than one year.
During the year ended 31 March 2012, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3.

Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.
LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012, QWHUHVW UDWH ULVN The Group has continued to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into a fixed rate retail bond of 100m, fixed rate senior notes and further interest rate swaps that fix a substantial part of the Groups core borrowings.
The debt relating to project finance non-recourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows.
The interest rate swaps entered into after 31 March 2009 are accounted for under IAS 39 hedge accounting with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps being recognised directly in reserves as they are effective hedges.
Any other outstanding interest rate swaps have not previously been allocated as hedges by the Group and are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39.
The interest rate swaps are presented in non-current liabilities or assets as they are related to long-term borrowings and the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
Changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest charge in the income statement.
In order to measure the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and scenarios run using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
The Groups exposure has not significantly changed.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted average average Floating Fixed interest Floating Fixed interest rate rate rate rate rate rate Group m m % m m % Financial assets Financial assets relating to PFI PPP Contracts 51.8 5.8 69.0 5.7 Cash and cash equivalents 19.1 0.5 40.5 0.4 Short-term deposits 40.7 0.6 14.0 0.7 Financial liabilities Bank overdrafts and short-term loans 8.2 4.2 Senior notes 48.1 5.6 31.6 6.9 Retail bond 82.4 5.0 87.1 5.0 Bank loans 128.0 2.4 126.1 2.8 Interest rate swaps 126.6 126.6 5.9 109.4 109.4 5.6 The interest rate swaps weighted average interest rate includes the fixed interest rate which ranges from 1.23% to 5.79% 2011: 1.74% to 5.79% and the margin of the underlying lending which ranges from 1.1% to 3.2% 2011: 1.1% to 2.75%.
Excluded from the analysis above is 7.5m 2011: 8.9m of amounts payable under finance leases as set out in note 23, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they are not interest bearing.

RUHLJQ H[FKDQJH ULVN The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements between the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Sterling.
The majority of the Groups subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional currencies: therefore there is limited transaction risk.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of 82.4m 2011: 87.1m fair value of 84.9m 2011: 84.2m as a net investment hedge of the Groups investments denominated in Euros.
The hedge was 100% effective for the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: 100% and as a result the related exchange gain of 4.7m 2011: 0.3m loss on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.
The Group mitigates some foreign exchange risk on financial assets arising in the UK through the use of forward exchange contracts.

LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 &RPPRGLW SULFH ULVN Fuel price risk The Group is exposed to fuel price risk therefore managements risk strategy aims to provide protection against sudden and significant increases in oil prices whilst ensuring that the Group is not competitively disadvantaged in a serious way in the event of a substantial fall in the price of fuel.
It is expected that part of this risk can be off-set through customers paying fuel surcharges and recovery via escalation clauses linked to the price of fuel within contracts such as UK PFI PPP.
To meet these objectives the fuel risk management programme allows for the use of a number of derivatives available on the over-the-counter OTC markets with approved counterparties and within approved limits.
The value of wholesale fuel covered by derivatives at 31 March 2012 amounted to 0.6m 2011: nil.
These fuel derivatives contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges against highly probable future fuel purchase forecasts to occur over the next six months.

The main commodities where the Group has exposure are paper, cardboard and ferrous metal.
The Group fide-risks part of this exposure by pass-through pricing and fixed price contracts.
The Group has not entered into any recyclate price derivatives however this remains under regular review.

As well as term borrowings under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of banks for working capital purposes.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained.
The Groups exposure to and the way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

LQDQFLDOV Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 &UHGLW ULVN Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance with a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
At 31 March 2012 the amount of credit risk totalled 59.8m 2011: 54.5m.
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for each counterparty.
Trade and other receivables mainly comprise amounts due from customers for services performed.
Management consider that the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been made for probable losses.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to these contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are UK local authorities or councils, there is minimal credit risk.
&DSLWDO PDQDJHPHQW The Group has a funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an appropriate debt maturity profile.
The strategy is based on the requirements of the Companys Articles of Association, which state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves.
The Groups funding strategy has not changed from the previous year.
The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior notes.
There are financial covenants which are measured using the performance of the core Group, excluding PFI companies and joint ventures, and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITDA and the net worth of the Group.
There are other restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues.
The Group has complied with its banking covenants during the year.

These costs are expected to be paid over a period of up to 25 years from the balance sheet date and may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
$IWHUFDUH Post-closure costs of landfill sites, including such items as monitoring, gas and leachate management and licensing, have been estimated by management based on current best practice and technology available.
These costs may be impacted by a number of factors including changes in legislation and technology.
The dates of payments of these aftercare costs are uncertain but are anticipated to be over a period of approximately 30 years from closure of the relevant landfill site.
2WKHU Other provisions principally cover onerous contracts, leases, warranties and indemnities.
Onerous contracts are provided at the net present value of the operating losses of the onerous contracts.
The provision is to be utilised over the period of the contract to which they relate which is up to 2029.
Under the terms of the agreements for the disposal of the UK landfill and power and other UK operations, the Company has given a number of warranties and indemnities to the purchasers which may give rise to payments.
The timing of expected outflows is uncertain therefore an estimate has been made and the majority of the provision has been classified as non-current.
Included within other provisions is 8.7m 10.5m received during the year following a court decision in respect of a claim for business interruption in the Netherlands that occurred in 2002.
The receipt of the amount was conditional on a parent company guarantee.
The courts decision has been appealed and the ultimate outcome of the case remains uncertain.
Accordingly, the Directors believe the amount should be recorded within provisions until the ultimate outcome of the case is known with greater certainty.

The Group and Companys principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme which covers eligible UK employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The Group also has one other small funded defined benefit scheme, which is included in the defined benefit disclosures below.
Pension costs for the defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
$VVXPSWLRQV The valuation has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the scheme as at 5 April 2009 updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2012.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2012 2011 % p. a % p. a Discount rate 5.6 4.8 Future salary growth non-Local Government Passport Section members 1.0 1.0 Future salary growth Local Government Passport Section members 4.4 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions payment fixed 3% 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 5% 3.2 3.4 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 2.5% 2.2 2.2 Rate of price inflation 3.4 3.6 Consumer price inflation 2.4 2.7 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2027 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for around a further 24 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 26 years after retirement if they are female.
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out in the table above.
The overall expected rate of return is derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2012.
At 31 March 2012 the IAS 19 net retirement deficit was 7.6m 2011: 4.9m surplus.
The amount of the liability varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased or decreased by 0.25%, the IAS 19 liability would increase or decrease by circa 1.9m.

These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
In Belgium, the Group operates small defined contribution schemes.

The Group takes legal advice as to the likelihood of success of claims and actions and no provision is made where the Directors consider, based on that advice that the action is unlikely to succeed or a sufficiently reliable estimate of the potential obligation cannot be made.
Under the terms of the sale agreement with Terra Firma for the disposal of the Groups landfill and power operations in 2004, the Group gave a number of indemnities and warranties relating to the disposed operations for which appropriate provisions are held.
At the start of the year the Group held a provision of 3.1m 3.5m relating to a claim from authorities for operating outside of permitted volumes in the period 1997 to 1999 at a location in the Netherlands.
During the year, the court issued a decision that 5.9m 7.1m was payable.
An appeal against the decision has been lodged.
The Directors believe that no further amount should be provided at this stage as the outcome of the appeal process is uncertain and the provision of 2.9m 3.5m established remains appropriate.
The claim relates to the period prior to the acquisition of the Netherlands group of companies in 2000 and accordingly any payment to the authorities may be recoverable from the previous owners under the sale and purchase agreement.
Any such recovery represents a contingent asset at 31 March 2012 and no receivable for a potential payment from the previous owners will be recorded until its receipt is virtually certain.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and performance bonds relating to the Groups contracts totalling 52.6m 2011: 40.6m.
