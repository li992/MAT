The comparative final dividend at 31 December 2011 was also not recognised as a liability in the prior year.
The proposed final dividend of 6.75p 2011: 6.75p per ordinary share will be paid on 21 June 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 May 2013, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
The impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2012 2011 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 36,197 56,857 Exceptional items 000 note 5 5,308 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share before exceptional items 000 41,505 56,857 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 305,345 304,458 Dilution effect of share plans 000 3,136 7,941 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 308,481 312,399 Basic earnings per share pence 11.9 18.7 Diluted earnings per share pence 11.7 18.2 Basic earnings per share before exceptional items pence 13.6 18.7 Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items pence 13.5 18.2 The above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Employee benefit Trust and held in the reserve.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
This calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
The remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.

Management applied a discount rate of 10%, representing the weighted average cost of capital for the Group, to the estimated future cash ows to calculate the terminal value of those cash ows.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill allocated to any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 31 December 2012 there was no impairment of goodwill.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2012 2011 000 000 Deferred tax assets 9,192 8,351 Deferred tax liabilities 850 233 8,342 8,118 At 31 December 2012, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 88.6m 2011: 80.7m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas tax, but should not be liable to UK tax if they were to be distributed as dividends.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 8.1m 2011: 20.7m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
All of the deferred tax asset for losses of 3.2m is dependent on generating future taxable profits.
Of the recognised deferred tax asset, 1.5m is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.

The fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Plans Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Share price 4.77 4.91 4.77 4.91 4.77 4.91 Average exercise price 4.77 4.91 Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 1.38 1.28 4.47 4.65 4.56 4.73 Expected volatility 40% 31% 40% 31% 40% 31% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 2 years 2 years Risk free rate 0.87% 2.84% 0.73% 2.84% 0.50% 2.84% Expected dividend yield 2.10% 1.83% Nil Nil Nil Nil Expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since otation.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the BlackScholes option pricing model.
The Group recognised total expenses of 13.2m 2011: 12.7m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Other share-based payment plans The Company also operates an Incentive Share Plan for the Executive Directors and senior employees and an Annual Bonus Plan for the Executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages 61, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the Employee benefit Trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Reserves Share premium The share premium account has been established to represent the excess of proceeds over the nominal value for all share issues, including the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve The movement in the capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
102 Reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust At 31 December 2012, the reserve for shares held in the employee benefit trust consisted of 15,715,157 ordinary shares 2011: 16,739,896 ordinary shares held for the purpose of satisfying awards made under the Incentive Share Plan, the Annual Bonus Plan and the Share Option Scheme SOS, representing 4.9% of the called-up share capital with a market value of 62.1m 2011: 58.4m.
There are 13,768,635 of these shares held in the trust on which dividends are waived.

The structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
104 i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Trade and other receivables Total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 31 December 2012 amounted to 141.7m 2011: 157.0m.
An initial credit period is made available on invoices.
No interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
Thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 150 days because historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 150 days are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables below 150 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 58.6m 2011: 69.6m that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of these receivables is 58 days in excess of the initial credit period 2011: 51 days.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross trade Gross trade receivables 2012 Provision 2012 receivables 2011 Provision 2011 000 000 000 000 Not past due 83,890 779 88,099 721 Past due 0-30 days 41,157 215 47,951 35 Past due 31-150 days 17,930 586 22,680 995 More than 150 days 5,461 5,152 5,342 5,342 148,438 6,732 164,072 7,093 The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client.
The demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an inuence on credit risk.
Less than 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
The geographic diversication of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
The majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, ageing prole, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.
105 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2012 2011 000 000 Balance at beginning of the year 7,093 6,397 Impairment losses recognised on receivables 5,620 8,148 Amounts written off as uncollectable 1,644 1,086 Amounts recovered during the year 2,237 3,611 Impairment losses reversed 2,100 2,755 Balance at end of the year 6,732 7,093 The majority of the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 1.6m 2011: 3.5m which have been placed in litigation, as well as a further provision for debts more than 150 days past their due date.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
Exposure to credit risk The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2012 2011 000 000 EMEA 71,741 78,694 United Kingdom 33,262 40,965 Asia Pacic 23,613 23,514 Americas 13,090 13,806 141,706 156,979 106 The maximum exposure to credit risk for accrued income at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2012 2011 000 000 EMEA 1,363 1,265 United Kingdom 10,184 9,925 Asia Pacic 10,244 8,755 Americas 4,301 5,541 26,092 25,486 The entire accrued income balance is not past due.
The fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above and in note 14.
ii Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the Companys shares.
The Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
107 The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities: Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2012 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 6,162 2,950 493 Accruals and other payables 40,386 39,653 29,410 2,779 Bank overdraft 9,396 Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2011 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 6,038 2,048 578 Accruals and other payables 48,445 30,960 33,919 2,685 Bank overdraft 6,249 Capital is equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders through share repurchases with subsequent cancellation, or issue new shares.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011. iii Market risk and sensitivity analysis The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
However, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical uctuations in Pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown on page 110.
There has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
For additional information on market risk, refer to Treasury management and currency risk in the Business Review.
108 Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at oating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Group does not consider this risk as significant.
The benchmark rates for determining oating rate liabilities are based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
The Groups only interest bearing assets and liabilities at 31 December 2012 relate to cash and bank overdrafts.
The average interest rate paid on bank overdrafts was 2.02% 2011: 1.91%.
Currency rate risk The Group publishes its results in Pounds Sterling and conducts its business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, the Group is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of its subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries.
The main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, Euro and Australian Dollar.
The Group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
In certain cases, where the Company gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange swap derivative financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
All derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classied as derivatives at fair value through the income statement.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
Information on the fair value of derivative financial instruments held at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.
Derivatives are disclosed within cash on the face of the balance sheet.
Contract amounts Derivatives at fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 Derivative Financial Instruments m m m m Derivative Assets 40.7 49.1 40.6 49.1 Derivative Liabilities 40.7 49.1 40.6 49.8 Net Derivative Liabilities Assets 0.7 Sensitivity analysis currency risk A 10% strengthening of Sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown on page 110.
This analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2011.
109 The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause uctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.
