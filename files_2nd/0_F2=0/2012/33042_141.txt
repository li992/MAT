166 Additional information Alternative performance measures Introduction We assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures.
We principally discuss the groups results on an adjusted basis.
The rationale for using adjusted measures is explained below.
Results on an adjusted basis are presented before specic items.
We also explain financial performance using measures that are not dened under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures.
The non-GAAP measures we use are underlying revenue, reported and adjusted EBITDA, reported, adjusted and normalised free cash ow and net debt.
A reconciliation from these non-GAAP measures to the nearest measure prepared in accordance with IFRS is presented below.
The alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
Specic items The groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specic items.
Specic items are those that in managements judgment need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
In determining whether an event or transaction is specic, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.
This is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Operating Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the group.
The directors believe that presentation of the groups results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the groups financial performance as specic items are identied by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
Items which have been considered to be specic items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence include disposals of businesses and investments, regulatory settlements, business restructuring programmes, asset impairment charges, property rationalisation programmes, net interest on pensions and the settlement of multiple tax years in a single payment.
In 2009 BT Global Services contract and financial review charges were disclosed as a specic item by virtue of their size and nature.
The impact of subsequent changes to the contract and financial review charges from revisions in estimates and assumptions are included within trading results before specic items, and are separately disclosed if considered significant.
Specic items are summarised below and disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue and other operating income In 2012 following a retrospective regulatory ruling in Germany, a one-off charge of 410m was recognised against revenue with an equal reduction in operating costs.
In 2012 a loss on disposal of 19m arose on the disposal of a subsidiary undertaking.
In 2010 a charge of 52m was recognised as a reduction in revenue reecting an Ofcom determination in relation to partial private circuits.
Operating costs Specic operating costs comprised BT Global Services restructuring costs of 64m in 2012 2011: 192m, 2010: 301m.
In 2013 we expect to incur further BT Global restructuring costs of around 40m in relation to the rationalisation of the Infonet and Radianz networks.
Property rationalisation charges of 90m were incurred in 2012 2011: 88m, 2010: 121m.
The property rationalisation programme has now been completed.
Net finance income Net finance income on pensions was 197m in 2012 2011: 79m expense, 2010: 279m expense.
Taxation The specic tax items tax credit of 142m in 2012 2011: 239m credit principally comprised a tax credit of 164m 2011: 172m for the re-measurement of deferred tax balances as a result of the change in the UK statutory tax rate from 26% to 24% effective in 2013 but enacted in 2012 and from 28% to 26% effective in 2012 but enacted in 2011.
The specic items tax credit of 420m in 2010 principally comprised a tax credit of 230m relating to the agreement of substantially all outstanding tax matters with HMRC relating to the 2008, 2007 and 2006 tax years resulting in a repayment.
Additional information Additional information Financial statements Financial statements Governance Governance Performance Performance Strategy Strategy Business Business Overview Overview Additional information Alternative performance measures Underlying revenue trends Underlying revenue is a measure which seeks to reect the underlying revenue performance of the group that will contribute to long-term profitable growth.
As such it excludes any increases or decreases in revenue as a result of acquisitions or disposals, any foreign exchange movements affecting revenue and any specic items.
We are focusing on the trends in underlying revenue excluding transit revenue as transit trafc is low-margin and is signicantly affected by reductions in mobile termination rates.
A reconciliation from the decrease in reported revenue, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to the decrease in adjusted revenue and to the decrease in underlying revenue excluding transit, is set out below.
2012 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March %%% Decrease in reported revenue 5.9 3.8 2.5 Specic items 2.1 0.2 0.1 Decrease in adjusted revenue 3.8 4.0 2.4 Acquisitions and disposals 0.3 0.1 Foreign exchange movements and other 0.2 0.2 1.7 Transit revenue 1.8 0.8 1.3 Decrease in underlying revenue excluding transit 1.9 3.0 2.9 EBITDA In addition to measuring financial performance of the group and lines of business based on operating profit, we also measure performance based on EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA.
EBITDA is dened as the group profit before depreciation, amortisation, net finance expense and taxation.
Adjusted EBITDA is dened as EBITDA before specic items.
EBITDA is a common measure used by investors and analysts to evaluate the operating financial performance of companies, particularly in the telecoms sector.
We consider EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to be useful measures of our operating performance because they approximate the underlying operating cash ow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation.
EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not direct measures of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash ow statement, and need to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.
A reconciliation from group operating profit, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported and adjusted group EBITDA, is set out below.
A reconciliation between operating profit and adjusted EBITDA for our lines of business is set out in Segment information, note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.

Basic and adjusted earnings per share, and the per share impact of specic items, is as follows: Pence Year ended 31 March 2012 per share m a Basic earnings per share profit 25.8 2,002 Specic items 2.1 166 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 23.7 1,836 Pence Year ended 31 March 2011 per share m a Basic earnings per share profit 19.4 1,502 Specic items 1.6 127 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 21.0 1,629 Pence Year ended 31 March 2010 per share m a Basic earnings per share profit 13.3 1,028 Specic items 4.0 308 Adjusted basic earnings per share profit 17.3 1,336 a The stated profit amounts are the components of the total profit which are attributable to equity shareholders excluding non-controlling interests.
Free cash ow Adjusted free cash ow Adjusted free cash ow is one of the groups key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured.
Adjusted free cash ow is dened as the net increase in cash and cash equivalents less cash ows from nancing activities except net interest paid and less the acquisition or disposal of group undertakings and less the net sale of short-term investments and excluding pension deficit payments.
It is also before the cash impact of specic items including tax related specic items.
For non-tax related items the adjustment is made on a pre-tax basis.
Adjusted free cash ow is primarily a liquidity measure, however we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and nancing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outows associated with investing in our infrastructure and nancing our operations.
In addition, adjusted free cash ow excludes cash ows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals and repayment of debt.
Our use of the term adjusted free cash ow does not mean that this is a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.
Additional information Additional information Financial statements Financial statements Governance Governance Performance Performance Strategy Strategy Business Business Overview Overview Additional information Alternative performance measures Normalised free cash ow We are now providing our financial outlook on a normalised basis which removes the impact of the tax benefit relating to pension deficit payments.
A reconciliation from net cash inow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to reported, adjusted and normalised free cash ow is set out below.
2012 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March m m m Net cash inow from operations 3,558 4,566 4,825 Add back pension deficit payment 2,000 1,030 525 Included in cash ows from investing activities Net capital expenditure 2,560 2,630 2,480 Interest received 82916 Dividends received from associates and joint ventures 4 7 3 Sales purchases of non-current financial assets 1 18 Included in cash ows from nancing activities Interest paid 693 973 956 Reported free cash ow 2,318 2,011 1,933 Add back: Net cash outow from specic items 204 212 173 Adjusted free cash ow 2,522 2,223 2,106 Cash tax benefit of pension deficit payments 215 147 74 Normalised free cash ow 2,307 2,076 2,032 Net debt Net debt consists of loans and other borrowings both current and non-current, less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and other borrowings are measured at the net proceeds raised, adjusted to amortise any discount over the term of the debt.
For the purpose of this measure, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to Sterling at swap rates where hedged.
This denition of net debt measures balances at the expected value of future undiscounted cash ows due to arise on maturity of financial instruments and removes the balance sheet adjustments made from the re-measurement of hedged risks under fair value hedges and the use of the effective interest method.
In addition, the gross balances are adjusted to take account of netting arrangements.
Net debt is a measure of the groups net indebtedness that provides an indicator of the overall balance sheet strength.
It is also a single measure that can be used to assess both the groups cash position and indebtedness.
There are material limitations in the use of alternative performance measures and the use of the term net debt does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.
Net debt is considered to be an alternative performance measure as it is not dened in IFRS.
The most directly comparable IFRS measure is the aggregate of loans and other borrowings current and non-current, current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents.
A reconciliation from this measure, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to net debt is given below.
