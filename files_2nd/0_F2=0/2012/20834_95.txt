The largest individual balance is the goodwill from the acquisition of Lead Yacht Underwriters Limited totalling 11.5 million 2011: 11.5 million.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
Value in use is calculated for each CGU using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management and discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Cash flow projections are based on the budgeted profit before tax for each CGU contained within the most recent business plans approved by management, and adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation.
As such, these forecasts reflect the best estimate of future cash flows based on historical trends and expected growth rates.
The period covered by the projections is five years.
The most significant assumptions used to derive the operating profit include an assessment of the market cycle, retention rates, claims inflation, outwards reinsurance expenditure and long-term investment return.
In order to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period, a long-term average growth rate of 2.5% 2011: 2.5% has been assumed for all CGUs, based on historical growth rates and managements estimates of future growth.
A risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 8.5% 2011: 8.5%, has been applied to each CGUs cash flow projection, which reflects a combination of factors including the Groups expected cost of equity and cost of borrowing.
In each case, the results of this exercise indicate that the recoverable amount exceeds the intangible assets carrying value and would not be sensitive to reasonable possible changes in assumptions.
