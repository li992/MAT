The basis of these impairment tests including key assumptions are set out below.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use future cash flow projections based on financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, net margin, capital expenditure and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The post-tax discount rate assumption of 8% 2011: 8% is based on the Groups weighted average post-tax cost of capital having considered the uncertainty risk attributable to individual CGUs.
The equivalent pre-tax discount rate is 10.6% 2011: 10.7%.
The pre-tax rate has been applied to pre-tax cash flows.
Aviation Aviation contracts are amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years as this period is the minimum time-frame management considers when assessing businesses for acquisition.
The carrying value of Aviation contracts is 27.8m 2011: 27.0m and the average remaining amortisation period is 6 years 2011: 7 years.
Value in use calculations are based on Board approved budgets and plans for a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three year period are extrapolated by growth rates that reflect managements specific location expectations for 2016 and 2017 incorporating a long-term growth rate derived using the best available market information such as Boeings 2012 Aviation Industry Review adjusted for the specific risks and challenges relating to Menzies Aviation.
Short-term revenue growth rates over 2016 and 2017 range from 0% to 6.5% 2011: 2.2% to 6.5% and longer term revenue growth rates range from 0.5% to 4.1% 2011: 0.5% to 3.5%.
Net margin assumptions are based on historic experience.
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each CGU.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
