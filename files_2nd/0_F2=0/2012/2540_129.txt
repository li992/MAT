The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken direct to equity of 1.3m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the group statement of comprehensive income before 4 October 2004.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 18 and 24 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term debt obligations with oating interest rates.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
The groups policy is to have an average over the next three years of between 25% and 80% of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
To manage this, the group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 30 September 2012 after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 86% of the groups borrowings are at a xed rate of interest 2011: 82%.
