Contingent liabilities As disclosed in note 6, in the previous year the Group received 4.6m refund of VAT charged on gaming machine income, together with associated interest of 0.7m.
The refund was made following a ruling that the application of VATto certain types of gaming machine income contravened the Europeans Union's principle of fiscal neutrality.
HMRChave appealed against the ruling, and if HMRC's appeal is upheld the refund and associated interest of 5.3m would be repayable.
