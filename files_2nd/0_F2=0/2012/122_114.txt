As a condition of these directors being authorised to forfeit these LTIP awards, they were obliged to use the full amount of the cash bonus to purchase shares in the Company prior to 13 April 2010.
Benefits in kind include the provision of a company car and fuel.
No director waived emoluments in respect of the years ended 28 January 2012 or 29 January 2011.
