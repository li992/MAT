They are, however, both complementary to the core business of investing in various asset classes to generate increasing value over the long term.
The Groups primary operating segments are the Company, Alliance Trust Savings ATS and Alliance Trust Investments ATI.
The disclosures below for ATI do not include the unit creations and cancellations in the ATIF since these do not have any impact on the operational performance of the Company.
