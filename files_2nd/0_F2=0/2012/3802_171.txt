The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period.
The actual return on assets was a gain of 172 million 2011: gain of 61 million.
The cumulative actuarial loss recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income was 502 million 2011: 387 million.
An actuarial loss of 115 million 2011: actuarial gain of 17 million was recognised during the year.
Measurement of the Groups defined benefit retirement obligations is particularly sensitive to changes in certain key assumptions, including the discount rate and life expectancy.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the UK discount rate would result in a 161 million decrease or 169 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations respectively.
An increase of one year in the life expectancy of all UK members from age 65 would result in a 46 million increase in the UK defined benefit obligations.
25 Called up share capital During the year 5,079,650 options were granted under The Compass Group Share Option Plan 2010.

When exercised, the holders received a number of shares calculated by reference to the increase in the market price at the time of exercise over the option price as shown in the table above.
Any remaining share appreciation rights are shown in the table above as lapsed.
Information relating to all option schemes The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 644.10 pence 2011: 573.44 pence.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.6 years 2011: 5.9 years for executive and management options and 0.4 years 2011: 1.4 years for employee schemes.
In the year, options were granted on 25 November 2011 and 17 May 2012 under the terms of the CSOP 2010.
The estimated fair value of options granted on these dates was 104.85 pence and 84.11 pence respectively.
In 2011, options were granted on 25 November 2010 and 19 May 2011.
The estimated fair value of these options was 134.75 pence and 151.88 pence respectively.
Fair values for the executive and management schemes were calculated using a binomial distribution option pricing model so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
In addition, a Monte Carlo simulation model was used to estimate the probability of performance conditions being met.
Fair values for options granted under employee savings-related schemes are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The expected volatility is calculated with reference to weekly movements in the Compass share price over the three years prior to the grant date.
The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of options granted under CSOP 2010: Assumptions options 2012 2011 Expected volatility 22.3% 35.0% Risk free interest rate 1.0% 2.5% Dividend yield 3.2% 3.3% Expected life 6.0 years 6.0 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 621.82p 584.49p Weighted average option exercise price 624.03p 574.76p Vesting of options awarded from October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the Group Free Cash Flow GFCF target.
For options granted after 30 September 2006, 25% of the awards will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of the awards will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.
Awards vest on a straight-line basis for GFCF between these two points.

The comparator group used for the award for the year commencing 1 October 2006 comprised all companies within the FTSE 100 Index, whereas, for subsequent years, only non-financial services companies have been included.
This performance condition is treated as a market-based condition for valuation purposes and an assessment of the vesting probability is built into the grant date fair value calculations.
This assessment was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The remaining 50% of LTIP awards made from 1 October 2005 onwards depends on the achievement of the GFCF target.
25% of that part of the award will vest if the threshold GFCF target is met and 100% of that part of the award will vest if the maximum GFCF target is met.

The GFCF performance targets relating to LTIP awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2007 and 1 October 2008 were met in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to the participants.
The element of awards made in the years commencing 1 October 2007 and 1 October 2008 dependent upon TSR performance targets also vested in full and the maximum number of shares available were released to participants as the Companys TSR performance was within the top quartile of the comparator group.
The weighted average share price at the date of release for LTIP awards released during 2012 was 555.05 pence 2011: 568.02 pence.
The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.1 years 2011: 1.1 years.
For the year ended 30 September 2012, LTIP awards were made on 25 November 2011 and 17 May 2012 for which the estimated fair value was 355.05 pence and 409.46 pence respectively.

These awards were all made under the terms of the 2010 LTIP.
The inputs to the option pricing model are reassessed for each award.

These awards are cash-settled and the fair value is reassessed at each balance sheet date.
The carrying amount as at 30 September 2012 was 95,000.
The fair value of restricted shares awarded in the year, including phantom awards, was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using the following assumptions: Assumptions restricted shares 2012 2011 Expected volatility 27.2% 35.1% Risk free interest rate 0.6% 1.0% Dividend yield 3.4% 3.2% Expected life 2.4 years 2.7 years Weighted average share price at date of grant 574.17p 555.00p The weighted average share price at the date of release for restricted share awards released during 2012 was 654.00 pence.
Long-Term Bonus Plan Certain executives participating in the Long-Term Bonus Plan in prior years received an award of deferred Compass Group PLC shares.
The award of bonus shares is subject to performance conditions and matching shares may be released by the Company following the completion of a further period of service.
The terms of the Plan require that these shares are purchased in the market, rather than being issued by the Company.
The shares are purchased and distributed by the ESOP and LTIPT.
