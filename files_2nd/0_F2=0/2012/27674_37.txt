Over the last three years, your Board has focused its progress during 2012 in efforts on restoring shareholder value.
With the accomplishment of the disposal of our Nordic business, external and internal debt repayments delivering the targets that and the special dividend paid to shareholders in June 2012, we have achieved those goals while delivering a total shareholder return for the year of 35% in sterling and 48% in rand.
I am also pleased to note that we set for ourselves and our total profit after tax attributable to ordinary shareholders reached 1,173 million.
in refocusing the Further details of our progress against targets, our future strategic direction and how risk and reward have been managed to ensure Groups operations alignment with shareholders and other stakeholders interests are contained in the following sections of this Report.
Board We were delighted to announce the recruitment of Danuta Gray as an independent non-executive director from March 2013 and I welcome her to the Board.
We were sorry to have to say goodbye at the end of February 2013 to Eva Castillo, who felt unable to continue on the Board because of the pressure of her other executive commitments.
Russell Edey and Lars Otterbeck will be retiring from the Board at the AGM in May 2013 and my colleagues and I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the major contribution that they have made during their respective periods on the Board.
Final dividend We have been pleased to be able to announce a significantly increased recommended final dividend for the year of 5.25p per share or its equivalent in other applicable currencies, as well as to update our policy for future dividend payments in a way that we hope will lead to continuing progress in shareholder returns.
Further information about the final dividend for 2012 is contained in the Shareholder Information section of this Report.
Annual general Meeting Our AGM will be held in London on 9 May 2013 and will be webcast as in prior years.
As usual, there will be an opportunity for shareholders to submit questions to be dealt with at the meeting.
Our shareholder circular relating to the AGM includes further details of these matters.
Shareholder communications Following my letter in November 2012, we have now moved to electronic communications as the main channel for communicating with our Patrick OSullivan shareholders in most of the territories where our shares are listed, and Chairman I am pleased that we will thereby be able to make a contribution to reducing our impact on the environment as well as reducing the Groups central costs.
Other matters It goes without saying that our success would not happen without the hard work of the Groups employees all over the world.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to pay tribute to them.
Future At the start of 2013 the financial world seems to have turned the corner and volatility is calming down.
However, in our markets we have learned that financial strength, strong cash flow and dividends are the differentiators in an uncertain world.
Following the completion of our restructuring last year, management is focused on growth in our key markets.
We are strongly positioned to achieve our targets and it is progress against these that will determine the next phase of our Groups development and strategy.

Populations are growing and, in most cases, also living longer.

markets in Africa, the Uk In sub-Saharan Africa, average life expectancy increased from 1 1 51 years in 2003 to 54 years in 2010.
South Africa was a rare exception to this pattern: average life expectancy was 52 years and across the globe 1 1 in 2010, slightly down from 53 years in 1970.
South Africas population grew 10% to 51 million between 2003 1 and 2011.
Over the same period, the population in sub-Saharan 1 Africa increased 22% to 876 million.
The proportion of the working age population also increased over this period.
In western Europe the number of retirees continued to increase, with the over-65 population of the European Union rising from 16.3% 1 in 2003 to 17.6% in 2011.
At the same time, living standards and expectations have also increased.
In our more mature markets people will spend longer in retirement and, as a result, will need a higher level of pension savings to fund their desired standard of living and healthcare costs.
In emerging markets, growing economic empowerment is driving demand for a broad range of protection, savings and investment products.
Global macro-economics Emerging economies are achieving higher GDP growth rates than developed economies.
GDP per capita in both South Africa and 1 sub-Saharan Africa more than doubled between 2003 and 2011, with annual GDP growth in sub-Saharan Africa above 4% in seven 1 out of the eight years.
As emerging markets develop, average incomes rise and the requirement for financial services evolves from simple funding and transactional products to more sophisticated protection and savings products.
Our strategy is to shape our offering to fit the wider macro-marketplace.

We believe that this early investment is timely and positions the group well to comply with the new management over regulatory requirements as they arise.
We are already sufficiently capitalised on an economic capital basis to the past four years.
comply with the new requirements as currently drafted.
We began the year with an established risk and governance Sue Kean framework set out in the Group Operating Model, economic group Chief Risk Officer capital tools developed through at least two full iterations, and transparent processes for managing, monitoring and controlling risks.
During 2012 we merged these new tools and processes into business-as-usual operations and embedded them more deeply into the underlying businesses.
We will continue to refine structures and processes, but the overall governance structures are stable and provide opportunities to obtain more detailed management information as required.
Risk frameworks, governance and the Groups internal capital model are overseen centrally but implemented by our businesses locally so that local requirements can be addressed appropriately.
This is reinforced through senior Group executive representation on business unit regulatory boards coupled with formal dual reporting for all key control functions.
In 2012 we revisited the risk strategy set in 2010, and now separately consider each of the regions in which we operate.
This has confirmed that each region is sufficiently capitalised in its own right and that the distribution and allocation of capital to the relevant businesses in each region largely reflect the different risk profiles within those regions.
This has also supported the decision and successful execution of our debt repayment programme.
Even when applying significant economic stresses to our current capital, the Group remains sufficiently capitalised.
We have also identified management actions that could be taken to remedy the Groups capital or liquidity position in a severe shock event where capital or liquidity levels significantly breach our risk appetite limits for a sustained period.
In future we will be seeking to make use of diversification within these different regions in line with the Groups overall strategy.
The sale of the Nordic business in Q1 2012 did not change our overall risk profile significantly, as Nordic had very similar risks to the other European business.
Broadly speaking, the risk strategy set in 2010 indicated a preference to reduce non-banking credit risk subsequently achieved through the 2011 sale of US Life and to increase liability risk.
While the overall strategy to increase liability risk but contain credit risk continues to make sense, evidential experience has shown that this will be difficult to achieve by organically growing pure risk products alone.
37 RISK ANd CAPItAL MANAGEMENT continued In 2013 risk management activity will build on the investment made The Groups overall risk profile, in the past, while supporting the following objectives: reflected by our economic capital Ensure that risk measures are embedded and influences the behaviours of our staff and management through our employee results, is stable and indicates performance management process Focus on our customers needs and requirements, and review that the Group is comfortably our product set to ensure that our products remain appropriate for our customers within appetite on all capital Further embed the use of relevant tools and skills to support us measures, despite the weakened in taking on risk through new product offerings and entry into new territories, thus supporting our expansion into Africa and further global recovery.

The most significant Old Mutual Wealth as the business implements its new external risks to earnings relate to the concentration of businesses operating model, including moving to an efficient cost base in South Africa and the translation of earnings from rand to sterling.
for the heritage books The level of the rand is very susceptible to changes in the level of Take on more liability risk in our Old Mutual Wealth business foreign investment in South African government debt.
high as the prolonged period of low growth in the US and Europe drives foreign investors to seek yield elsewhere.
Any reversal of these flows could potentially trigger rapid decline in the rand, reducing our sterling earnings.
Having modeled scenarios involving a severe rand drop, we are comfortable that the Group has sufficient capital and liquidity headroom to withstand such events.
As the Groups businesses position themselves for growth over the next few years, we recognise that this could increase short-term operational risk particularly in Old Mutual Wealth, where the pace and level of change are greatest.
Generally, at business unit level the increase in exposures is driven primarily by structural changes and cost control measures offset by continuing expected improvements to the control environment.
Our relative exposure to operational risk is expected to reduce over the planning period, although in absolute terms it will remain stable due to business growth.
Exposure to credit risk has increased slightly, reflecting growth in Nedbank and Old Mutual Finance, but remains within appetite limits.
In the current environment, our South African business remains exposed, from an earnings perspective, to interest rate risk.
The Group remains underweight compared to its risk strategy goal of increasing liability risk, and business plans include a number of actions to increase this exposure while meeting our risk and return requirements.
Old Mutual Bermuda OMB, has significantly reduced market risk exposures including volatility risk, due to the hedging programme introduced in March 2012 and favourable surrender experience this year.
This has greatly benefited the overall Group capital position.
Our strategic emphasis on customer focus and continuing senior-level engagement with regulatory policymakers position us well to address changes such as the UKs Retail Distribution Review and twin peaks regulation in the UK and SA.

areas of best practice and The Board and the Group Audit Committee continued to monitor the Groups financial position, reviewing monthly financial information and considering the Groups full-year and interim governance results announcements so as to ensure that they presented an accurate and appropriate picture of the Groups affairs.
In line with recommendations emanating from last years externally facilitated Board effectiveness review, we refined the content of the Boards monthly financial reports.
Attention was paid to ensuring that Board and Committee members were receiving the right amount and type of information that would best enable them to obtain assurance about the state of the Groups finances, risk management and culture through a proactive marshalling of Board and Committee materials.
We also continued to take a close interest in the management of the run-off of liabilities under the closed book of business at Old Mutual Bermuda, which we were pleased to note showed a satisfactory and improving trend.
On the strategic front, we received presentations on our South African businesses plans to expand into the rest of Africa, on Old Mutual Wealths repositioning for the post-RDR world and on Nedbanks readiness for Basel III, among other topics, and we continued to devote a significant amount of Board time to discussing longer-term strategic options for the Group as a whole.
The Board again received feedback from the annual survey of Group culture and values, which helped to show where improvements had been achieved and where work still needed to be done.
We see this as a crucial tool for monitoring and, where necessary, initiating change in the prevailing ethos of our businesses, which is so important for a customer-focused financial services group like ours.
The Company continues to seek to widen skills and diversity at Board level and we are pleased that Danuta Gray has joined us with effect from 1 March 2013.
In the regulatory area, we received further briefings on the prospective impact on the Group of Solvency II, including the consequences arising from the likely postponement of the implementation date for this new solvency regime.
We also regularly reviewed the status of relationships with our regulators.
Looking forward, I am focused on ensuring that the Board continues to have the necessary skills and capacity to deal with the issues that face the Group and that we meet investors ever-increasing expectations in the areas of best practice and governance.

In this respect, extensive work has been done by the Company on the remuneration to develop risk management processes that ensure rewards are appropriately aligned with both shortand long-term performance and do not encourage excessive risk-taking in the Group.
This arrangements for the approach has been adopted in line with FSA guidelines and the evolving requirements of Solvency II.
executive directors During 2012, the long-term incentives granted in 2009 vested fully against the agreed three-year performance targets.
This was the first time in four years that vesting had occurred under the long-term incentive plan.
For awards made under the Old Mutual Strategic Incentive Plan OMSIP in 2010, which were subject to targets for vesting at the end of 2012: 85.9% attainment was achieved in relation to awards made with Financial Objectives although actual vesting will be in two equal tranches in 2013 and 2014: and 75% attainment was achieved in relation to the one-time awards made for Rationalising Objectives, specifically approved by shareholders in 2010 to incentivise a change in the strategic direction and restructuring of the Group over three years.
Vesting will be in two equal tranches in 2013 and 2014.
After the 2010 and 2011 OMSIP awards, revised long-term incentive financial targets were agreed for 2012 awards, as described in the 2011 Remuneration Report, in order to provide an appropriate level of reward for sustained financial performance within agreed risk parameters.
For 2013, based on shareholder consultation, changes have been made to reflect the fact that further progress is expected on some key strategic initiatives.
It is important that management incentives are adequately aligned.

The following are the guiding principles that the Committee has applied during 2012 and intends to apply during 2013: To take account of appropriate benchmarks, while using such comparisons with caution and recognising the risk of an upward ratchet of remuneration levels with no corresponding improvement in performance.
Large UK insurers and members of the UK FTSE100 Index, with particular reference to a subset by market capitalisation, provide the benchmarks for UK-based executive directors To be sensitive in determining, reviewing, monitoring and approving matters under its remit in relation to pay and employment conditions around the Group, where relevant To make a significant percentage of total maximum potential rewards in the form of share-based incentives in order to align the executive directors interests closely with those of shareholders To provide an opportunity for remuneration packages to be in the upper quartile of the comparator group through payments under short-term and long-term incentive schemes if superior performance is delivered To focus attention on the main drivers of shareholder value by linking performance-related remuneration to clearly defined objectives and measurable targets To design remuneration arrangements that will attract, retain and motivate individuals of the exceptional calibre needed to lead the Groups development.
The Committee has regard to risk-related metrics in reviewing and evaluating the executive directors short-term performance and receives and considers a report from the Group Chief Risk Officer.
It also has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance ESG issues, to the extent relevant, when setting their remuneration.
It ensures regulatory requirements relating to remuneration matters are met and that remuneration policies are consistent with, and promote, effective risk management.
The Committees policy is influenced by the need to be competitive with other international financial services groups, while avoiding any excess.
This includes its approach to setting the fixed elements of remuneration at or below median.
It reviews this policy regularly and continues to consider it to be appropriate.
Following the removal of compulsory retirement ages in the UK, it is the Companys policy to have employment contracts without a specified duration.
Notice periods are between six and twelve months and mitigation is applied to any termination payments that have to be made under contract.
Overview of executive directors remuneration The Committee reviews the structure of the executive directors remuneration packages annually to satisfy itself that the balance between fixed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term incentives and rewards remains appropriate.
The overall make-up of the remuneration packages for the executive directors is as follows: Element Description Basic salary Reviewed each January, taking into account market benchmarks and the level of increases awarded to all Group employees.
The policy is to pay a benefit allowance and pension contributions to a total value of 35% of basic salary.
Life cover of 1m and disability cover capped at an annual basic salary of 140,000 are also provided.
From 1 April 2013, changes to benefits will come into effect as follows: i Life cover will increase to 1.25m, with an option to increase cover to 6x base salary, subject to the insurers underwriting process and approval: ii disability cover will be capped at an annual basic salary of 120,000 for a maximum of five years: and iii single private health cover will be provided.
These changes align to updated provisions for Benefits all UK employees.
Payable subject to achievement of agreed financial targets and agreed scorecard objectives.
The policy is currently to make a maximum award of 150% of basic salary, half in cash and half deferred in Company restricted shares for three years.
Short-term incentives Deferred awards are subject to claw-back.
The policy is currently a maximum award of 250% of basic salary.
Vesting is subject to agreed performance targets as set out Long-term incentives in the section of this report entitled Long-term incentives.
Awards are subject to claw-back.
Executive directors remuneration in 2013 Basic salary and benefits With effect from 1 January 2013, Julian Roberts basic salary was increased by 1.7%, from 870,000 to 885,000, and Philip Broadleys basic salary was increased by 1.7%, from 580,000 to 590,000.
These increases were below the average increases for other employees across the Group, ranging from 2% for staff in the UK to in excess of 5% in South Africa other business units in Europe and US falling within this range, in line with the local market.
Before making the decision on the increases for the executive directors, the Committee considered the salary increases for other employees in the Group as set out above.
Benefits equivalent to 35% of basic salary will continue to be payable either as contributions to agreed benefits or monthly in cash.
Life cover and disability cover will continue to be provided and, with effect from April 2013, single private health cover will be provided.
Pensions and flexible investment plans The Company offers a pension plan and has introduced an Employee Flexible Investment Plan, which has been approved for its UK-based employees.
Julian Roberts and Philip Broadley qualify to participate in both plans, but have indicated that they will not be contributing to either during 2013 and that they intend to opt out of pension auto-enrolment when that is introduced later this year.
The Company will therefore not be making contributions to any such schemes on their behalves.
Short-term incentives for 2013 The short-term incentive policy to be applied during the year is described above and there have been no changes to the policy from 2012 to 2013.
51 SUMMARY OF THE REMUNERAtION REPORT continued Long-term incentives for 2013 The Company will continue to align leadership incentives with the delivery of a shared Group vision, strategy and desired culture through agreed values and behaviours.
In South Africa, this will focus on the retail segment as well as successful expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, through the combined efforts of Nedbank, OMSA and Mutual & Federal.
In Old Mutual Wealth, the main strategic opportunities are in delivering cost efficiencies, building an integrated, modern wealth management business in the UK and in selected international markets supported by a successful asset management business and managing the remaining European businesses for value.
In the US, the focus will be on the improvement of USAMs performance in terms of margin and net client cash flow and the effective management of risk and liabilities in Old Mutual Bermuda.
Previously, under OMSIP, part of the executive directors long-term incentives was linked to Rationalising Objectives relating to strategic initiatives to be undertaken by the Group between 2010 and 2012, however, for awards made in 2012 there was no strategic element.
Some shareholders have expressed concern about this and suggested that there should be both a strategic element and a returns measure in the long-term incentive plan.
To address these concerns, we have expanded the core set of measures, as set out below, by adding a strategic element and a return on equity measure.
The outcome of the measures will be subject to the TSR-multiplier mechanism implemented in 2012.

Annual culture survey results compared to prior years results and to international standards Measured at Group and business level for improved scores where needed or maintenance where levels in 2012 are high.
The Committee will apply its discretion in determining the final outcomes in relation to the 2013 long-term incentives, and in this regard: The Committee will receive a report from the Chief Risk Officer to confirm that the performance of the Group has been achieved within the stated risk appetite.
Where the risk appetite has been breached, the Committee will have discretion to reduce the level of vesting accordingly The Committee will exercise its discretion to make adjustments where there is a significant negative impact on underlying financial performance which is not adequately reflected in AOP results for example, where LTIR adjustments create any inconsistency between AOP and IFRS basic earnings Where the Group undergoes a significant change, such as a large disposal, acquisition or restructuring, the Committee will review the targets to assess whether they need adjusting to reflect the change, or whether they should be replaced altogether.

Further information terms of engagement executive directors The terms of engagement of the executive directors are considered by the Committee to provide a proper balance of responsibilities and security between the parties.
The following is a summary of the main provisions: Provision Service contract Contract dates Julian Roberts 23 January 2009, as amended on 22 November 2011 Philip Broadley 10 November 2008, as amended on 22 November 2011 Notice period Julian Roberts 12 months by either the Company or the director Philip Broadley 12 months by the Company and 6 months by the director Compensation for loss of office Tailored to reflect the Companys contractual obligations and the obligation on the part of the employee to mitigate loss Compensation payable on early termination No contractual provision terms of engagement Chairman and non-executive directors Patrick OSullivan entered into an engagement letter with the Company in August 2009 as amended in December 2011 setting out the terms applicable to his role as Chairman from January 2010.
Under these terms, subject to: a 12 months notice at any time given by either the Company or Patrick OSullivan, b his being duly re-elected at Annual General Meetings, and c the provisions of the Companys Articles of Association relating to the removal of directors, his appointment was for an initial term of three years, renewable thereafter for a further three years subject to the same provisos, followed by up to three additional one-year terms.
Mr OSullivans term of engagement has now been extended for a second three-year term with effect from 1 January 2013.
The other non-executive directors are engaged on terms that may be terminated by either side without notice.
However, it is envisaged that they will remain in place initially for two successive three-year terms, in order to provide assurance to both the Company and the non-executive director concerned that the appointment is likely to continue.
The renewal of non-executive directors terms for successive three-year cycles is not automatic, with the continued suitability of each non-executive director being assessed by the Nomination Committee.
Non-executive directors engagements are extended on an annual basis for a maximum of three years from the end of their second three-year cycle.
All directors including the executive directors are required to stand for re-election annually at the Companys Annual General Meeting.
The following table sets out details of where each non-executive director other than the Chairman now stands in relation to the framework of appointment described above: Date current Date of original Date of current Current term appointment appointment appointment as director terminates Mike Arnold 1 Sep 2009 1 Sep 2012 2nd 1 Sep 2015 1 Russell Edey 24 Jun 2004 24 Jun 2010 3rd final year 9 May 2013 Alan Gillespie 3 Nov 2010 3 Nov 2010 1st 3 Nov 2013 Danuta Gray 1 Mar 2013 1 Mar 2013 1st 1 Mar 2016 Reuel Khoza 27 Jan 2006 27 Jan 2013 3rd 2nd year 27 Jan 2014 Roger Marshall 5 Aug 2010 5 Aug 2010 1st 5 Aug 2013 2 Bongani Nqwababa 1 Apr 2007 1 Apr 2010 2nd 1 Apr 2013 Nku Nyembezi-Heita 9 March 2012 9 March 2012 1st 9 March 2015 1 Lars Otterbeck 14 Nov 2006 14 Nov 2012 3rd final year 9 May 2013 1 Russell Edey and Lars Otterbeck will retire at the conclusion of the Companys Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2013.

Basis of preparation Adjusted operating profit AOP reflects the directors view of the underlying long-term performance of the Group.
AOP is a measure of profitability which adjusts the standard IFRS profit measures for the specific items, and as such it is a non-GAAP measure.
This reconciliation explains the differences between adjusted operating profit and profit after tax as reported under IFRS as adopted by the EU.
For core life assurance and general insurance businesses, AOP is based on a long-term investment return, including investment returns on life funds investments in Group equity and debt instruments, and is stated net of income tax attributable to policyholder returns.
For the US Asset Management business it includes compensation costs in respect of certain long-term incentive schemes defined as non-controlling interests in accordance with IFRS.
For all core businesses, AOP excludes goodwill impairment, the impact of acquisition accounting, revaluations of put options related to long-term incentive schemes, profit loss on acquisition disposal of subsidiaries, associated undertakings and strategic investments, and fair value profits losses on certain Group debt movements but includes dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities.
Old Mutual Bermuda is treated as a non-core operation in the AOP disclosure, and Nordic, which is disclosed as discontinued operations for IFRS reporting, is also treated as a non-core operation for AOP disclosure.
Non-core operations are not included in AOP.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is calculated on the same basis as AOP.
It is stated after tax attributable to AOP and non-controlling interests.
It excludes income attributable to Black Economic Empowerment trusts of listed subsidiaries.
The calculation of the adjusted weighted average number of shares includes own shares held in policyholders funds and Black Economic Empowerment trusts.

The financial information for the periods shown has been abridged from the Group financial statements within the Group accounts.
The auditors opinion on the Group accounts for the year ended 31 December 2012 was i unqualified: ii did not include references to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying their reports: and III did not contain any statements under section 498 2 or 3 of the Companies Act 2006.

Following final regulatory approval on 8 March 2012 and subsequent shareholder approval, the sale was completed on 21 March 2012.
The sale represented the Groups exit from the life assurance market in the Nordic region and therefore met the criteria of a discontinued operation.
The assets and liabilities of Nordic were classified as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2011.
At 31 December 2012, following the completion of the disposal, there are no assets and liabilities of Nordic remaining in the Statement of Financial Position.
For the purposes of adjusted operating profit, Nordic is classified as a non-core operation.
Further details of the impact of discontinued operations are provided in note 6.
Special dividend and share consolidation On 9 March 2012 the Group declared a special dividend of 18p per 10p ordinary share to all holders of those shares on the register at 20 April 2012 and the dividend was subsequently paid on 7 June 2012.
A seven-for-eight share consolidation was effected on 23 April 2012 and from that date only new 3 ordinary shares of 11 7 pence have been in issue.
For basic and diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted with effect from 23 April 2012.
For adjusted operating earnings per share the adjustment of the weighted average number of shares has been made effective 1 January 2012.
Consequently the comparative information in the adjusted operating earnings per share note 3 b has been restated accordingly.
Reporting of Retail Europe within Old Mutual Wealth On 24 January 2012 the Group announced that it would combine its Old Mutual Wealth Continental Europe business France and Italy with the Skandia Retail Europe business unit Germany, Austria, Poland and Switzerland.
As a result of these operational changes, the businesses previously reported as the Retail Europe segment are now reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been reclassified where applicable.
Integration of OMAM UK with Skandia Investment Group On 26 April 2012 the Group announced the integration of Old Mutual Asset Management UK OMAM UK with Skandia Investment Group.
OMAM UK was previously reported within the US Asset Management segment and Skandia Investment Group is reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment.
Consequently OMAM UK is included within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
In September 2012 the Group announced the merger of the Skandia businesses Skandia UK, Skandia International, Old Mutual Global Investors and the Skandia European businesses outside of the Nordic region into a single business called Old Mutual Wealth.
The operational changes are designed to combine asset management capability with UK platform strength and international expertise to grow into a leading provider of wealth management solutions in selected markets.
As a result the businesses previously reported as the Retail Europe segment are now reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Cancellation of treasury shares On 13 January 2012 the Group announced that it had cancelled 239,434,888 ordinary shares of 10p each previously held in treasury.
Repayment of debt On 18 January 2012, the remaining 200 million of the 750 million subordinated bond was repaid on the first call date.
Following an open market tender offer on 19 July 2012, the Group announced it repurchased 388 million of the 500 million senior bond with a repayment date of 1 August 2012.
On 23 August 2012, the Group announced it had applied to repay the US$750 million subordinated cumulative perpetual notes at their nominal value.
The transaction was completed on 24 September 2012.
On 4 December 2012, 5 million of the 500 million perpetual preferred callable securities and on 5 December 2012, 2 million of the 350 million preferred callable securities were acquired, both via open market repurchase.
62 Old Mutual plc Summary Financial Statements 2012 How we What Where we Financials have Our risks we do are going performed How we govern our business 1.3: Critical accounting estimates and judgements Specific areas that have required closer attention in respect of the estimates and judgements during the year ended 31 December 2012 are explained in more detail below: Policyholder liabilities Emerging Markets Financial Soundness Valuation discount rate The calculation of the Groups South African Life assurance contract provisions is sensitive to the discount rate applied to future liabilities.
The methodology applied by the Group requires discount rates to be set according to the Financial Soundness Valuation FSV principles as prescribed by the Actuarial Society of South Africa.
In line with these principles the reference rate is selected as the Bond Exchange of South Africa BESA par bond 10-year yield.
During 2012 the reference discount rate applied to its South African business reduced from 8.2% to 6.9% in line with observable market data.
During H1 2012, the discount rate reduced from 8.2% to 7.6%, which resulted in an increase in FSV provisions of 20 million.
During H2 2012, the discount rate reduced further from 7.6% to 6.9%, resulting in a further increase to FSV provisions of 15 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2012 a broad duration-based hedge was implemented which partially mitigated the negative impact of the decline in the FSV rate over H2.
This hedge remains in place and is expected to reduce the South African businesss sensitivity to interest rate movements in future.
The Group estimates that a 1% reduction in the discount rate will result in an increase in policyholder liabilities of 39 million 2011: 42 million, allowing for the impact of the duration-based hedge.
The growth in the book over 2012 and the fact that a 1% fall now represents a larger proportionate fall in interest rates mean that the sensitivity at the end of 2012 is higher than the actual impact observed over 2012.
Old Mutual Bermuda guarantees Old Mutual Bermuda was closed to new business on 18 March 2009.
Managements key priority since the closure to new business has been to fide-risk the business.
The main risks associated with this business relate to guarantees in the products previously sold by the business.
At 31 December 2012 a total of 21,975 2011: 34,828 contracts remain active, comprising 20,910 variable annuity products 2011: 33,373 and 1,065 deferred and fixed index annuity investments 2011: 1,455.
The variable annuity products provided both a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB and guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB.
During 2012 the business experienced significantly higher rates of surrender than assumed, with 12,380 variable annuity contracts surrendering in total 2011: 5,657.
The increase in surrender activity was attributable to variable annuity UGO policyholders passing through a top-up process on the fifth anniversary following product inception.
At 31 December 2012 approximately 70% of variable annuity UGO policyholders had reached their 5-year top-up.
At 31 December 2012, 77% of non-Hong Kong policies and 57% of Hong Kong policies had been surrendered on or after their 5-year anniversary date.
The significantly reduced size of the book has meant that associated GMAB reserves have reduced from $1,056 million at 31 December 2011 to $229 million at 31 December 2012 while the associated GMDB reserves reduced from $5 million to $155,677.
The favourable lapse experience has been reflected in surrender assumptions for the remaining policies that are yet to go through their 5-year policy anniversary.
These revised assumptions have resulted in further releases of reserves, contributing positively to IFRS and MCEV operating profits for 2012.
Policies still in force after the 5-year anniversary are no longer subject to surrender penalties.
The Group continues to operate strong oversight over the business.
The key remaining risk relates to the 10-year GMAB top-up process which will commence in 2017.
