1 Context of remuneration at BHP Billiton At BHP Billiton, our executive remuneration arrangements are designed to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled people and ensure that their interests are aligned with the interests of our shareholders.
Executives are only eligible to receive their maximum remuneration if we perform exceptionally well in the short term and our shareholders have also benefited significantly from the relative performance of the Group in the longer term.
Executive remuneration is linked substantially to relative shareholder returns.
However, it is also linked to the wellbeing of the Group, meaning that other elements that may not be reflected so directly or immediately in shareholder returns are also taken into account in determining the quantum of executive remuneration, including various health, safety, environment, community HSEC, financial and capital management measures.
Regulatory requirements also change from time to time, which means our reporting has to change too.
We are aware of deliberations taking place in the UK and Australian jurisdictions that will provide additional guidance to companies in respect of the reporting of executive remuneration: however, those deliberations have not yet reached the stage necessary to provide certainty as to their outcomes for inclusion in this Remuneration Report.
We will be making the necessary changes to our Remuneration Report in future years in accordance with those reporting requirements when the outcomes are known.
We have continued to try to improve the transparency of our reporting by including this new section to provide a clearer explanation of the remuneration provided to the CEO, Marius Kloppers, in relation to FY2012.
Further details of all of the remuneration aspects described below can be found in later sections of the Remuneration Report.
2 Remuneration of the CEO for FY2012 BHP Billiton ensures that the remuneration arrangements for the CEO, Marius Kloppers, include a large proportion that is at risk meaning that set performance targets must be achieved in order to receive part or all of the remuneration available.
The following table shows the actual remuneration received by the CEO as determined by the Remuneration Committee in relation to the FY2012 and FY2011 performance years.
Descriptions of all of the remuneration components in the table are included in section 6.5.

2 Remuneration of the CEO for FY2012 continued Mr Kloppers STI is at risk.
The Committee determined an individual scorecard of measures for the CEO at the commencement of the performance year.
These measures have been chosen as they reward the CEO for overall performance in the current year, comprising both financial performance and delivery against measures that impact the long-term sustainability of the Group, along with his individual contribution to the business.
The Board believes this method of assessment is transparent, rigorous and balanced, and provides an appropriate, objective and comprehensive assessment of performance.
The maximum possible cash STI Mr Kloppers can be paid is 160 per cent of base salary, with a target of 80 per cent of base salary.
Mr Kloppers STI scorecard includes HSEC, financial, capital management and personal elements.
In assessing performance against elements such as financial measures, we do not include impacts that are outside managements control, such as movements in exchange rates or commodity prices.
Removing those elements means remuneration is tied to the things management can control primarily, safety, volume and cost.
As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, Mr Kloppers advised the Remuneration Committee that he did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012.
For the FY2011 performance year, Mr Kloppers received 69 per cent of the maximum possible.
Mr Kloppers cash STI outcome is ordinarily matched in value by an award of Deferred Shares, vesting in two years.
These Deferred Shares are also at risk, because they are matched to the cash STI measured against scorecard outcomes and have service conditions attached.
Mr Kloppers LTI outcome is also at risk.
The purpose of the LTI is to focus the CEOs efforts on the achievement of sustainable long-term growth and success of the Group including appropriate management of business risks and to align CEO rewards with sustained shareholder wealth creation through the relative US$ Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition.
The five-year duration of the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP is longer than most other plans in the market, and has received strong voting support from shareholders since it was introduced in 2004.
The actual value on vesting will not be known until the vesting time i. e. five years from award allocation and will depend on the level of achievement against the performance condition as detailed in section 6.8.
5, achievement of the service conditions continued employment or leaving the Group under specific circumstances and on the share price at the time of vesting.
The actual value of the award may ultimately be zero.
Further information on how the Committee determines remuneration and how each component of remuneration is measured for the purposes of that process is provided in section 6.5.
Details of how the determinations made by the Committee translate into remuneration as measured by accounting standards under Australian and United Kingdom disclosure regulations are provided in section 6.7.
3 2007 allocation under the LTIP tested to the end of FY2012 and vested in FY2013 The five-year performance period for the 2007 LTIP ended on 30 June 2012 and 333,327 Performance Shares that were allocated to the CEO in December 2007 will vest.
This was the first LTIP allocation to Mr Kloppers as CEO.
The allocation of 225,000 Performance Shares that vested last year was made prior to him becoming CEO.
Over the five-year performance period, BHP Billitons US$ TSR was 41.6 per cent.
In contrast, the weighted average US$ TSR for the peer group against which the Groups performance was measured was -4.0 per cent.
Of the 15 peer companies, only two companies recorded US$ TSR outcomes in excess of BHP Billitons 41.6 per cent US$ TSR performance one at 45.6 per cent and one at 41.9 per cent, and eight peer companies recorded negative US$ TSR performance over the five-year performance period.
The impact of this 45.6 per cent US$ TSR outperformance by BHP Billiton over the weighted average was to add US$75.4 billion of shareholder value from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2012 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators as shown in the following graphs.

The actual calculation of TSR for the LTIP performance hurdle assumes that the dividends paid are reinvested in the relevant company on the date that the dividends are paid.
The contribution of dividends to TSR performance will therefore vary from the indicative numbers shown in the table above.
