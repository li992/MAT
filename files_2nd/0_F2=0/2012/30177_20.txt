As at 31 December 2012 the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs has been based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding expected cash flows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and the discount rates.
Future cash flow projections are based on the most recent Board approved financial budgets for 2013 which are used to project cash flows for the next five years.
After this period a steady state cash flow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU.
Goodwill has an indefinite life and this is reflected in the calculation of the CGUs terminal value.
Estimated average growth rates, based on each regions constituent country growth rates as published by the World Bank, are used to estimate cash flows after the budgeted period.
The growth rates used were 2% for Europe and the Middle East, and 3% for North America, Brazil and Asia.
Resultant cash flows for Europe and the Middle East, Asia and Brazil have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% 2011: 11.5%, and for North America have been discounted at 13.5% 2011: 11.5% reflecting the higher level of uncertainty in the forecasts of that CGUs future cash flows.
The calculations of value in use for Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Brazil have been subject to stress tests demonstrating that the impairment test results are tolerant to reasonably possible changes in assumptions as to discount rate and future cash flows.
Despite the action that has been taken to rebuild the scale of the North American business since the raid in the second half of 2009, and to reduce costs, its performance weakened further during 2012.
The estimated recoverable amount for the North America CGU is 123.0m less than the balance sheet carrying value, and this has been recognised as an impairment of the goodwill attributed to that CGU.
The recoverable amount attributable to the North America CGU remains sensitive to future changes in the key valuation assumptions.
A 1% increase in the discount rate would result in an additional impairment of around 8m.

The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
None of the Groups financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched Principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
The above analysis reflects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal.

Share-based payments As at 31 December 2012 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, for the granting of non-transferable awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
Outstanding awards at 31 December 2012 and their estimated fair values when granted are set out below: Estimated Awards fair outstanding value at 2012 grant date 1 Long term incentive award 2009 429,980 199p 1 Long term incentive award 2011 557,501 246p 2 Long term incentive award 2011 44,761 309p 1 Long term incentive award 2012 714,649 139p 1,746,891 Notes: 1 Subject to total shareholder return and return on capital conditions.

The share options under the long term incentive award 2010 lapsed during the year.
The estimated fair value of each option granted under the long term incentive awards 2009, 2011 and 2012 which are subject to market conditions, were calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, the expected life of the option until exercise, a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity profile and the volatility and correlation of Total Shareholder Return TSR with a comparator group of companies.
The 2011 and 2012 awards are also subject to TSR comparison relative to the UK Retail Price Index.

Acquisitions a Subsidiaries acquired during the year Chapdelaine & Co. On 3 January 2012 the Group acquired 100% of the membership interests of Chapdelaine & Co, subsequently renamed Chapdelaine Tullett Prebon, LLC.
The final consideration paid, including for assets acquired, was US$11.2m 7.2m in cash.
Net liabilities with a fair value of US$0.7m 0.4m were acquired, comprising US$3.7m 2.4m cash, US$2.1m 1.3m intangible assets, US$0.8m 0.6m fixed assets, US$2.7m 1.7m trade and other receivables, US$4.7m 3.0m trade and other payables and US$5.3m 3.4m provisions.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition was US$11.9m 7.6m, attributable to the acquired workforce and the businesss reputation.
At 31 December 2012 goodwill was 7.3m as a result of changes in exchange rates.
The Chapdelaine business has been fully integrated into the Groups operations, and it is therefore considered impractical to show the earnings for the period after the date of acquisition.
Attributable revenue in the period since acquisition was 16.9m.
Costs relating to the acquisition have been recognised in administrative expenses as incurred.
Costs incurred in 2012 amounted to 0.1m with 0.3m having been expensed in 2011.
Other acquisitions During 2012 the Group spent 0.4m in cash acquiring other interests on which a further estimated 1.0m in cash consideration, subject to performance conditions, is payable over the next four years.
Net assets acquired were negligible resulting in goodwill of 1.4m.

As at 31 December 2012 cash and cash equivalents amounted to 281.5m 2011: 342.0m.
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short term deposits are made for varying periods of between one day and three months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short term deposit rates.
Financial assets comprise short term government securities and term deposits held with banks and clearing organisations.
Contingent liabilities In respect of legal matters or disputes for which a provision has not been made, notwithstanding the uncertainties that are inherent in the outcome of such matters, there are no issues which are considered to pose a significant risk of material adverse financial impact on the Groups results or net assets.
In the normal course of business, certain Group companies enter into guarantees and indemnities to cover trading arrangements and or the use of third party services or software.

Retirement benefit obligations a Defined benefit schemes As at 31 December 2012 the Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme, formerly the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme which was renamed in 2012 following the merger with the Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme.
A small number of schemes are operated in other countries which collectively are not significant in the context of the Group.
The Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme Defined Benefit Section is a defined benefit final salary funded pension scheme.
The Principal Employer is Tullett Prebon Group Limited.
i The defined benefit section of the former Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme was closed to new members in 1991 and since May 2003 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members in service in 1991 receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For defined benefit section members in service in May 2003 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
ii The former Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme was closed to new members in 1989 and since April 2006 future accrual on a defined benefit basis has ceased.
Members receive benefits on the better of a money purchase underpin and defined benefit basis.
For members in service in April 2006 there is a continuing link between benefits and pensionable pay.
The assets of the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme are held separately from those of the Group, either in separate trustee administered funds or in contract-based policies of insurance.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid into the UK defined benefit schemes during 2013 is 0.5m.
The latest funding actuarial valuations of the former Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme and of the former Prebon Yamane Ex K-W Pension Scheme were carried out as at 30 April 2010 and 1 January 2010 respectively by independent qualified actuaries.
The main financial assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries of the UK defined benefit schemes to calculate the liabilities under IAS 19 were: 2012 2011 % % Discount rate 4.40 4.70 Expected future return on scheme assets 6.72 6.77 Expected rate of salary increases 4.45 4.55 1 Rate of increase in LPI pensions in payment 2.50 2.40 2 Inflation assumption 2.50 2.40 1 This applies to pensions accrued from 6 April 1997.
The majority of current and future pensions receive fixed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
2 In 2011 the basis for the inflation assumption changed to CPI from RPI.
83 Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 36.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2010 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Prebon Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in 15 years at age 60 will live on average for a further 28.5 years 2011: 28 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 30.8 years 2011: 31 years after retirement if they are female.
