Manganese Strong performance at GEMCO and Hotazel underpinned annual ore production and sales Tom Schutte records in FY2012.
President, Manganese US$ million Consistently strong operating performance and improved plant availability at both GEMCO in Australia and Hotazel in South Revenue 2,152 Africa underpinned annual ore production and sales records Underlying EBIT 235 in FY2012.
Alloy production was substantially lower than the Capital expenditure 418 corresponding period following the termination of energy Net operating assets 1,456 intensive silicomanganese production at Metalloys and the temporary suspension of production at TEMCO.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$462 million to US$235 million.
The GEEP2 expansion project will further A 22 per cent decline in the average realised price of ore and a 10 per cent decline in the average price of alloy reduced solidify GEMCO as one of the lowest cost Underlying EBIT by US$400 million, net of price-linked costs.
and largest manganese mines in the industry In contrast, record manganese ore sales increased Underlying EBIT by US$64 million.
The US$167 million BHP Billiton share GEEP2 expansion project will further solidify GEMCO as one of the lowest cost and largest manganese mines in the industry.
On completion, the GEEP2 project will increase processing capacity from 4.2 to 4.8 million tonnes per annum 100 per cent basis.
Metallurgical Coal A modest increase in production was achieved in FY2012 despite numerous operating challenges.
Record annual Hubie van Dalsen production was achieved at Illawarra Coal in Australia.
President, Metallurgical Coal US$ million Production at Queensland Coal remained constrained largely as a result of industrial action, weather-related downtime Revenue 7,576 and geotechnical issues at Gregory Crinum.
Record annual Underlying EBIT 1,570 production at Illawarra Coal in Australia followed successful Capital expenditure 2,808 Net operating assets 6,845 commissioning of the West Cliff Coal Preparation Plant upgrade project.
Underlying EBIT for FY2012 decreased by US$1.1 billion to US$1.6 billion.
Lower production and associated unit cost pressures at Queensland Coal reduced Underlying EBIT by Record annual production US$1.1 billion.
In contrast, a six per cent increase in the price of hard coking coal increased Underlying EBIT by US$339 million, achieved at Illawarra Coal net of price-linked costs.
In response to the challenging external environment, the Group has chosen to delay the 2.5 million tonnes per annum 100 per cent basis expansion of Peak Downs associated with the Caval Ridge mine development.
The 5.5 million tonnes per annum 100 per cent basis Caval Ridge mine remains on schedule to deliver first production in CY2014.
Approval of the US$845 million Appin Area 9 Project was also announced during FY2012.
