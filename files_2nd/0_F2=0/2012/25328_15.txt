Basis of preparation $V VHW RXW LQ WKH 'LUHFWRUV 5HSRUW WKH 'LUHFWRUV LQ WKHLU FRQVLGHUDWLRQ RI JRLQJ FRQFHUQ KDYH reviewed comprehensive cash flow forecasts prepared by management, which are based on prudent market data and past experience and believe, based on those forecasts and an assessment of the Group's committed banking facilities and the available headroom, that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements of the Group on a going concern basis.
In arriving at their conclusion that the Group has adequate financial resources, the Directors were mindful that the Group had unrestricted cash of 77.8 million as at 31 December 2012, a 100 million banking facility available for investment in new or existing projects which is committed until 8 May 2014, under a new three year facility which commenced May 2011 and is forecast to continue in full compliance with the associated banking covenants.
During the year, the Company completed a capital raising as disclosed in note 31.
Certain risks and uncertainties which arise as a result of the current economic environment have been considered by the Board.
The Board has concluded that these do not represent a significant threat to the Group as its income is generated from a portfolio of PFI concessions which are supported by government backed or other suitably high creditworthy counterparty backed cash flows and are forecast to cover the Group's committed costs.

Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, issued by, or adopted by, the European Union, interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, applicable legal and regulatory requirements of Guernsey and the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the reported amounts in these financial statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, as amended to reflect certain items that are presented at fair value.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
71 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries up to 31 December 2012.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition and where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition costs are those costs predominantly legal and financial advisory costs, due diligence costs, stamp duty and including the investment advisory fees in respect of the acquisition incurred by the Group in connection with acquisitions of investments.
Any costs incurred after 1 January 2010 are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Prior to 31 December 2009, any costs directly attributable to the acquisition were included as part of the costs of acquisition.

This intangible is initially recognised at fair value and is subsequently amortised over the life of the underlying concessions.
The Group also recognises an intangible asset for the right to charge users of the infrastructure assets within a service concession.
This intangible asset is initially measured at fair value and is subsequently amortised over the remaining life of the concession from the date on which it is available for use.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at fair value on acquisition, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over the estimated useful life, using the reducing balance method.

Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pound sterling which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies RWKHU WKDQ WKH HQWLW V IXQFWLRQDO FXUUHQF IRUHLJQ FXUUHQFLHV DUH UHFRUGHG DW VSRW UDtes on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at spot rates.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the spot rates at the date when the fair value was determined.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements the assets and liabilities of WKH URXSV IRreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rate at the date of transactions are used.

Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets including PFI PPP concession intangible assets within the scope of IFRIC 12, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs including those in respect of PFI PPP concession finance assets are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.

Significant accounting policies continued Taxation 7KH &RPSDQ V VXEVLGLDULHV DUH VXEMHFW WR FRUSRUDWH income tax on any taxable income, after allowing for both revenue and capital deductions arising from their activities.
The tax expense included in the Consolidated Income Statement represents the sum of the current tax and deferred tax and is calculated in accordance with applicable legislation in the jurisdictions in which each entity operates.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in past or future years and it further excludes items that DUH QHYHU WD[DEOH RU GHGXFWLEOH 7KH URXSV OLDELOLW IRU FXUUHQW WD[ LV FDOFXODWHG XVLQJ WD[ rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to an underlying transaction charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or equity correlating to where the underlying transaction has been charged or credited.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside the Consolidated Income Statement are recognised in correlation to the underlying transactions either in other comprehensive income or equity.
75 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
The carrying value of the financial asset is adjusted to reflect changes in actual and estimated cash flows with any adjustment recognised as income or expense in profit or loss.
The change in carrying value is calculated by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows at WKH ILQDQFLDO DVVHWV RULJLQDO HIIHFWLYH LQWHUHVW UDWH Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments.
Available for sale financial assets Investments classified as available for sale are measured initially and at each subsequent reporting date at fair value.
For available for sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, until the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the profit or loss for the period.
The fair value of available for sale financial assets are determined as follows: x the fair value of available for sale financial assets with standard terms and conditions and traded on an active liquid market are determined with reference to quoted market prices: or x the fair value of other available for sale financial assets are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable market transactions.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis as referred to above.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other shortterm highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
76 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value, being substantially equal to the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs which are charged to Share Capital in accordance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Hedge accounting The Group designates hedging instruments as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationships between the hedging instrument and hedged item, along with the risk management objective and its strategy for undertaking various transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Where ineffectiveness is judged to have occurred, the amount of the ineffectiveness is taken to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is terminated, for example if a project is refinanced.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is recycled through the Consolidated Income Statement over the remaining life of the instrument on a straight line basis.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where an intangible is not yet ready for use, it is tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
77 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount and any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cashgenerating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For shares classified as available IRU VDOH $ 6 D VLJQLILFDQW RU SURORQJHG GHFOLQH LQ WKH IDLU value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the URXSV SDVW H[SHULHQFH RI FROOHFWLQJ SD PHQWV DQ LQFUHDVH LQ WKH QXPEHU RI GHOD HG payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised through profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are meaVXUHG DW WKH 'LUHFWRUV EHVW HVWLPDWH RI WKH H[SHQGLWXUH UHTXLUHG WR VHWWOH WKH REOLJDWLRQ DW the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
78 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued Leases Service concessions which fall outside of the scope of IFRIC 12 are assessed in accordance with IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease.
Where it is assessed that the service concession does contain a lease, the concession is considered as either a finance lease or an operating lease in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
Under IAS 17, a finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
When the benefits and risks with the asset reside with the PFI project company these assets are accordingly disclosed in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is calculated over the life of the concession or specific asset life if shorter.
PFI PPP Concessions PFI PPP concessions which fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 6HUYLFH &RQFHVVLRQ Arrangements conform to the following policies depending on the rights to consideration under particular concession agreement: x Financial assets Service concessions give rise to financial assets where the Group, as operator, has an unconditional contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the Client grantor.
Revenue is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash receivable to construction income and service income.
During construction, revenue is recognised at cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain, less any losses incurred or foreseen in bringing construction to completion, and less amounts received as progress payments in accordance with IAS 11.
Costs for this purpose include valuation of all work done by subcontractors whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
For any contracts where receipts exceed the book value of work done, the excess is included in liabilities as payments on account.
During the operational phase, cash received in respect of the service concession is allocated to the services revenue, with the remainder allocated between capital repayment of the financial asset and interest income, using the effective interest method.
Financial assets are classified as loans and receivables when it is determined that cash flows are deemed to be fixed or determinable and measured at fair value at inception and thereafter carried at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
79 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued x Intangible assets Service concessions give rise to intangible assets where to the extent that the Group, as operator, has a contractual right to charge users of the public services provided by the infrastructure.
The intangible asset represents the construction cost of assets which give rise to the contractual right to charge users and is amortised to estimated residual value over the remaining life of the service concession and tested each year for impairment.
Revenue arising in respect of service concessions giving rise to an intangible asset is recognised when the services are delivered.
x Bifurcation between financial assets and intangible assets Where part of the concession is accounted for as a financial asset and part an intangible asset, the fair value of consideration receivable under the arrangement is allocated between the financial asset and the intangible.
The fair value of consideration related to availability or minimum take-or-pay payments is allocated to the financial asset and the difference between the total consideration and the amount allocated to the financial asset is allocated to the intangible asset.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, Q WKH SURFHVV RI DSSO LQJ WKH URXSV DFFRXQWLQJ SROLFLHV ZKLFK DUH GHVFULEHG LQ QRWH management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Service Concession under IFRIC 12 x Service concessions fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 where the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price: and the grantor controls, through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise, any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the service arrangement.
Judgement is required to determine whether PFI concessions controlled by the Group fall within this scope and, if so, whether the nature of the arrangement gives rise to a financial asset, an intangible asset, or both.
x Service concessions are determined to be financial assets where the operator has a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor.
Alternatively, service concessions are determined to be intangible assets to the extent the operator has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
Where service concessions are determined to contain both of these elements, a bifurcated model will be adopted.

Financial Assets The fair value of financial assets has been determined by discounting future cash flows at an appropriate discount rate.
The discount rates utilised to discount future cash flows are calculated by adding a project specific premium to the 15-year gilt yield at 31 December 2012.
80 International Public Partnerships Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued The premium takes into account several factors, including but not limited to, the stage reached by each project, the period of operation, historical track record and with reference to recent market transactions.
Intangible Assets Intangible assets represent fair value of service concessions for operating subsidiary projects recognised on acquisition, which are primarily attributable to the service portion of the project contracts, and intangible assets recognised under IFRIC 12.
Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to the services portion of the service concessions acquired at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.

The Group is committed to decommissioning the offshore electricity transmission platforms and certain transmission cables at the end of the relevant regulated revenue generating periods.
The timing of the amounts settled in respect of these provisions are uncertain and dependent on various factors that are not always within the Groups control: The timing of decommissioning is contingent upon any re-powering of the relevant associated wind farm to which the transmission assets relate and therefore the potential for the transmission assets to be used beyond the initial revenue generating periods.
In such circumstances, the costs of decommissioning would be expected to be deferred until such time as would be agreed in any subsequent terms.
However, the current assumption is that it is too uncertain to assume the wind farms will be re-powered and, therefore decommissioning costs have been assumed to be incurred at the earliest most likely dates.

In line with the lending requirements under project agreements for PFI PPP type investments there is generally a requirement for the underlying project entity to either enter a fixed rate loan agreement for the life of the concession or, if a variable interest rate loan is agreed, an interest rate swap agreement is entered into at the commencement of the loan.
The effect of the interest rate swap is to mitigate interest rate risk that the underlying project entity may be exposed to.
As a result, the group has minimal exposure to any change in interest rates.

Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the interest rate yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.

These are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the GrRXSV FDVK IORZ exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the period that the floating rate interest payments on debt impact profit or loss.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and PFI PPP concessions are entered into with government or quasi government or other public or equivalent low risk bodies.
Receivables consist of a small number of government or quasi government counterparties that are spread across a diverse geographical area.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single non government or quasi government or similar counterparty.
In relation to offshore transmission investments, the Group is protected in accordance with the Energy Act 2004 in the event of an insolvency of the National Electricity Transmission System Operator.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on liquid funds, cash held on deposit and financial instruments.
