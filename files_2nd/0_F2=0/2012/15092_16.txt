68 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation The financial statements of SuperGroup Plc the company and SuperGroup Plc and its subsidiary undertakings in the UK, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, France, Netherlands and Turkey as detailed in note 16.20 the Group have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by fair values, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The current period 2012 is for the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2012 2011: 52 weeks ended 1 May 2011 2011.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies note 16.2.
Net debt analysis as set out in note 16.30, which is a non-GAAP measure, has been provided as it is considered to be useful to the reader.
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except where indicated.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 C-Retail Limited, Cult Retail LLP, DKH Retail Limited, Laundry Athletics LLP, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited into the financial statements of SuperGroup Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts.
This accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve note 15.4.
All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting note 16.1c.
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic benefits.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
c Business combinations The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group.
The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment.
Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments.
Cost also includes directly attributable costs of investment.
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 69 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued Movements in the fair value of contingent consideration and the fair value uplift to inventory are disclosed on the face of the statement of comprehensive income as the directors believe it is helpful to understand the performance of the business excluding these items.
d Foreign currencies The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the actual rate or average rate if not materially different.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate equity reserve.
e Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities, as described below.
The Group bases its estimate of returns on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the specifics of each arrangement.
Standalone store revenue Standalone store revenue from the provision of sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Standalone store sales are settled in cash or by credit or payment card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the customer with a right to exchange within 28 days.
Concession revenue Concession revenues from the provision of sale of goods are recognised gross at the point of sale of a product to the customer.
Concession revenues are settled in cash, by the concession grantors net of commissions or other fees payable.
It is the concessions policy to sell its products with a right to exchange within 28 days and a cash refund within 14 days.
Internet revenue Revenue from the provision of the sale of goods on the internet is recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which is the point of dispatch.
Transactions are settled by credit card, payment card or Paypal.
Provisions are made for internet credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
Wholesale revenue Wholesale revenues from the sale of goods and provision of services are recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed to the customer, which depends on the specific terms and conditions of sales transactions and which are typically upon either dispatch or delivery.
Revenues are settled in cash, net of discounts.
Provisions are made for Wholesale credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.
f Other income Other income relates to proceeds from legal claims and royalty income.
Royalty income is recognised gross on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the Wholesale royalty agreements.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 70 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued Royalty income earned by the Wholesale segment from the Retail segment is eliminated on consolidation being an intercompany transaction.
g Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested.
Finance income is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
h Finance expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
Finance expenses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method.
i Leasing and similar commitments Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent-free periods and are considered financing activities for the purposes of the cash flow statement, as they are the same as financing from landlords to fund store fit-outs.
Cash contributions Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a deferred income liability in the balance sheet at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met, and credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
Cash contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement of comprehensive income over the life of the lease.
The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the longer of the term of the lease, or from property access date to the end of the lease.
Rent-free periods are not discounted.
Lease premiums Lease premiums paid to landlords are initially recognised as a prepayment, and lease premiums paid to previous tenants are initially recognised as an intangible asset, in the balance sheet, at the point the recognition criteria in the lease is met, and debited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date.
j Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and reviewed annually for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition but excludes interest.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount and are recognised within other gains and losses net in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their remaining useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years on a straight-line basis Leasehold improvements 5 7 years on a straight-line basis Furniture, fixtures and fittings 5 7 years on a straight-line basis Computer equipment 3 5 years on a straight-line basis Motor vehicles 25% on a reducing balance basis Land is not depreciated.
Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 71 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued k Impairment The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated.
Cash-generating units are considered to be the combined UK standalone stores, the concessions, internet, UK and international wholesale, Europe and Republic of Ireland divisions.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows which are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting note 16.1b is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings.
l Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows: Trademarks 10 years Website and software 5 years Lease premiums Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis Distribution agreements 6 years Trademark costs comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs.
Website and software costs consist primarily of externally incurred development costs.
Lease premiums comprise the amount paid to the previous tenant to acquire the lease.
Distribution agreements comprise the fair value, at date of acquisition, of distribution agreements acquired as part of a business combination.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
m Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at their fair value and remeasured at fair value at each period end.
Derivative financial instruments are categorised as held for trading.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting.
Foreign forward exchange derivative gains and losses are recognised in other gains and losses.
Movements on derivative financial instruments are disclosed separately on the face of the Group statement of comprehensive income as the directors believe it is helpful to understand the performance of the business excluding movements on financial derivatives.
n Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost comprises costs associated with the purchase and bringing of inventories to the distribution centres and is based on the weighted average principle.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-downs and shrinkage.
o Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less impairment losses.
A provision for the impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according to the original terms.
Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 72 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued p Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are offset against cash when a right of offset exists and the Group intends to use this right of offset.
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, less overdrafts, which are repayable on demand.
q Borrowings Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs, including facility fees incurred, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is remeasured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted at market interest rates for similar loans.
Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the origination gain or loss, and the amortisation is recorded as finance income cost using the effective interest yield method on the asset liability.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
r Provisions and contingent liabilities A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
s Employee benefit obligations The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its employees.
The Group pays contributions into an independently administered fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
The costs to the Group of providing these benefits are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income and comprise the amount of contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the year.
Payroll expense and related contributions Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
t Share based payments The Group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan.
The fair value of the shares under such plans is recognised as an expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Fair value is determined using the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
u Trade and other payables Trade and other payables, excluding lease incentives see note 16.1i, are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair value which approximates book value.
Trade and other payables are fide-recognised when the contractual obligations to the cash flows from the liability expire or are transferred.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 73 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued v Taxation The policy for current and deferred tax, when relevant, is as follows: tax on the profit or loss for the period will comprise current and deferred tax: current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years: deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date: a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised: and deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
w Dividends In the future, dividends will be recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date.
Dividends will be disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or proposed or declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved for issue by the directors.
x Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity, as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
y Retained earnings The retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits and losses of the Group.
z Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the Group restructuring in March 2010 and represents the differences on consolidation arising on the adoption of predecessor accounting.
This comprises the difference between consideration paid, the book value of net assets acquired in the transaction less any impairment.
aa Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating DecisionMaker.
The Chief Operating Decision-Maker, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the executive board members.
ab Cost of sales Cost of sales comprises movements between opening and closing inventories, purchases, carriage in, commissions payable, and other related expenses.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 74 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.1 Principal accounting policies continued ac Exceptional Items Items that are material in size, unusual or infrequent in nature, are disclosed separately as exceptional items in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
The separate reporting of exceptional items, which are presented as exceptional within the relevant category in the Group statement of comprehensive income, helps to provide an indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
The principal items which may be included as exceptional items are: significant profit loss on the disposal of non-current assets: impairment of property, plant and equipment: impairment of non-current other receivables: impairment of intangible assets: impact on deferred tax for changes in tax rates: the costs and benefits associated with significant corporate, financial or operational restructuring, including acquisitions and the IPO: and charges for non-trading related bonuses and share based payments.
ad Events occurring after the balance sheet date The values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are adjusted if there is evidence that subsequent adjusting events warrant a modification of these values.
These adjustments are made up to the date of approval of the financial statements by the board.
Other non-adjusting events are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements where they are material.
16.2 Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
a Recoverability of deferred tax assets The Group has recognised a significant deferred tax asset in its financial statements which requires judgement for determining the extent of its recoverability at each balance sheet date.
The Group assesses recoverability with reference to board approved forecasts of future taxable profits.
These forecasts require the use of assumptions and estimates.
The Groups subsidiaries will need to make taxable profits of at least 156.3m over the next 18 years 2011: 170.7m over 19 years to obtain the full tax deduction against the amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets in those subsidiaries.
b Impairment of goodwill The Group has tested goodwill for impairment which requires judgement when determining the recoverable amount.
Further details of the impairment testing and the key assumptions are included in more detail in note 16.19.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 75 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.3 New accounting pronouncements There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 2 May 2011 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
The following new standards, new interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued but are not effective for the financial year beginning 2 May 2011: IAS 19 amendments, Employee benefits, amended in June 2011.
The impact will be as follows: to eliminate the corridor approach and recognise all actuarial gains and losses in OCI as they occur: to immediately recognise all past service costs: and to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability asset.
This is not applicable for the Group as it does not have any defined benefit pension schemes.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments, addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities.
IFRS 9 was issued in November 2009 and October 2010.
It replaces the parts of IAS 39 that relate to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.
IFRS 9 requires financial assets to be classified into two measurement categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classification depends on the entitys business model for managing its financial instruments and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the instrument.
For financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 9 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 10s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 12, Disclosure of interest in other entities, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
The requirements, which are largely aligned between IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied where its use is already required or permitted by other standards within IFRSs or US GAAP.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 13s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.
16.4 Segment information The Groups operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on the reports reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker executive board members the board.
The board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on profit before tax, before inter-segment royalties.
The board considers the business from a customer perspective only, being Retail and Wholesale.
The board receives information, reviews the performance of the business, allocates resources and approves budgets for two operating segments, and therefore information is disclosed in respect of the following two segments: Retail principal activities comprise the operation of UK and Republic of Ireland stores, concessions and all internet sites.
Revenue is derived from the sale to individual consumers of own brand and third party clothing, footwear and accessories: and Wholesale principal activities comprise the design and ownership of brands, wholesale distribution of own brand products clothing, footwear and accessories worldwide and the operation of European stores.

The Group reports and manages central functions as part of Retail operations, which includes the goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation.
Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
The revenue from external parties reported to the board is measured in a manner consistent with that of the IFRS financial statements.
Royalties charged between segments have been reflected in the performance of each business segment.
Inter-segment transfers or transactions entered into under a cost plus pricing structure are not reflected in the performance of each business segment.

In the prior period, the Group adopted a policy of including all non-reclaimable duty and freight costs incurred in getting inventories into the Groups distribution centres into the cost of inventory.
The impact of adopting this new policy was to increase the value of inventories by 3.5m as at 1 May 2011, of which 1.6m related to periods to 2 May 2010 and earlier.
Impact of IFRS 3 revised on inventory acquired at date of acquisition The fair value adjustment to inventories acquired on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA under IFRS 3 revised, which values inventories at its sales price less costs to sell, increased the value of inventory in the prior period by 1.9m 2012: nil.
The directors have considered this to be a non-underlying adjustment to profit.
Fair value movement of deferred share consideration The SuperGroup Europe BVBA acquisition in the prior year included two tranches of deferred contingent consideration to be issued on the second and third anniversaries of the acquisition.
The consideration is payable in shares, and the shares will be issued in proportion to the percentage completion of certain sales and store number targets.
The fair value of these shares at the acquisition date was 10.3m.
IFRS 3 revised requires deferred contingent consideration to be remeasured at each period end to reflect the estimated percentage completion of the targets and change in share price.
By 1 May 2011, the fair value had increased by 0.4m, reflecting the year end share price of 15.86.
At 29 April 2012 the share price was 3.50 and therefore the liability reduced by 8.3m and this has been recorded as a credit in the Group statement of comprehensive income.

Within this amount, 340m was identified as intangible assets and goodwill, of which the directors believe that 187m should be deductible against taxable profits over the useful economic lives of the respective assets.
This gave rise to 52.4m of the exceptional deferred tax credit booked in 2010.
Based on this the directors consider that the Groups future cash tax expense should be reduced by approximately 3.4m per annum using the corporation tax rate of 24%.
The Groups underlying tax expense of 12.2m represents an effective tax rate of 28.5% for the period ended 29 April 2012.
The Groups underlying effective tax rate of 28.5% is higher than the statutory rate of 25.8%, primarily due to depreciation of non-qualifying assets and non-allowable expenses.
The UK corporation tax rate reduction from 26% to 24%, with effect from 1 April 2012 is substantially enacted at the balance sheet date so the deferred tax balances at 29 April 2012 have been remeasured resulting in an exceptional deferred tax charge of 3.2m.
Discussions with HMRC in respect of the tax deductible goodwill arising on the March 2010 reorganisation have significantly progressed.
Written confirmation has been received from HMRC that they will not challenge the commercial nature of the transactions.
The related deferred tax asset in respect of the goodwill therefore continues to be considered recoverable.

Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, the goodwill on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
Goodwill attributable to SuperGroup Europe BVBA amounted to 17.7m 2011: 19.2m.
Goodwill is deemed to be part of the Group function and is therefore included in the Retail segment.
The recoverable amounts in 2012 were measured based on value in use 2011: based on fair value less costs to sell given the proximity of year end to the acquisition date.
Detailed forecasts for the next three years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
Key assumptions In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 Financial Statements Governance Performance Introduction 92 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.19 Intangible assets continued Pre-tax adjusted discount rates Pre-tax adjusted discount rates are derived from risk free rates based upon long-term government bonds in the territories within which the CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment has been applied to risk free rates to reflect the risk inherent in the territories to which the cash flows arise.
The pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate used for SuperGroup Europe of 11.6%, reflects the mix of geographical territories within which the CGU operates.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure.
Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the three years, a long-term average growth rate has been used: this is not greater than the average longterm growth rate in each of the territories where the CGU is based.
This results in an average growth rate for SuperGroup Europe of 2.6%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been performed.
The table below shows the assumptions used and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.
The directors do not consider this to be reasonably possible.
Group Assumptions used Change required % % points Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate 11.6 9.6 Long-term growth rate 2.6 -10.6 The discounted forecast operating cash flows were 114.1m and a percentage change of 61% in isolation would be required in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

The additions in the prior period relate to SuperGroup Belgium NV and SuperGroup Belgium Finance NV.
SuperGroup Europe BVBA was acquired by SuperGroup Netherlands BV, a 100% owned subsidiary of SuperGroup Belgium NV.
The impairment in investment balances relates to 18.2m in C-Retail Limited, 16.2m in SuperGroup Concessions Limited and 4.7m in SuperGroup Retail Ireland Limited.
The impairment has resulted from the following factors: the purchase price paid for the subsidiaries of the Group, which contained the trade and assets of the former LLPs, prior to Initial Public Offering determined the cost of the investments.
The purchase price was based on a cash flow model which used certain assumptions to estimate the future cash flows including overheads.
The forecasts used in the current year impairment models reflect the actual central costs and the allocation of these costs between the companies.
The directors note that whilst an impairment has arisen in some companies, there is additional headroom in others, notably DKH Retail Limited.
the trading outlook for both SuperGroup Ireland and SuperGroup Concessions has deteriorated since IPO as a result of the economic climate in Ireland and the cannibalisation of concessions by the roll out of owned stores which has had a greater impact than anticipated.

16.31 Financial risk management The company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is responsible for managing.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
For those sales considered higher risk, the Group operates a policy of cash in advance of sale.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major credit cards or by Paypal.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.
21339-04 06-07-12 Proof 1 SuperGroup Plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 103 16 Notes to the Group and Company Financial Statements 16.31 Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign currency exposure arises from: transactions sales purchases denominated in foreign currencies: monetary items mainly cash receivables and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies: and Investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation.
The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollar and Euro currency risks.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each company is monitored and managed at a Group level.
The Groups policy is to hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.
As at 29 April 2012 and 1 May 2011, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk.
Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been applied.
Forward exchange contracts are valued at fair value.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed primarily through purchases denominated in the relevant foreign currency.
At 29 April 2012 if the currency had weakened strengthened by 10% against both the US Dollar and Euro with all other variables held constant, profit for the period would have been 1.6m 2011: 0.7m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar Euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables.
The Groups foreign currency exposure is as follows: Group 2012 2011 US Dollar Euro US Dollar Euro m m m m Financial assets Trade receivables 2.0 3.3 Cash and cash equivalents 8.6 9.0 5.1 0.6 Assets 8.6 11.0 5.1 3.9 Financial liabilities Trade payables 2.1 2.9 1.2 0.8 Liabilities 2.1 2.9 1.2 0.8 Net exposure 6.5 8.1 3.9 3.1 The US Dollar and Euro overdrafts form part of an offset arrangement and as such each currency is netted off against other cash balances in the same currency and is not recognised as an overdraft in its own right.
Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows variable rate.
Management does not currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the Group.
The Groups significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 16.24 to 16.26.

Trading derivatives are classified as a current asset or liability.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and noncurrent borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The Group is in a net cash position at 29 April 2012.
The Directors have concluded that the company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth.
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2012 2011: nil.
