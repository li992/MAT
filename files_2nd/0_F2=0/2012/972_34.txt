ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES COAL estimates as at 31 December 2012 METALLURGICAL COAL The Coal Reserve and Coal Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
Anglo American Metallurgical Coal comprises export metallurgical and thermal coal operations located in Australia and Canada.
Mine Life The extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnes apply to each product.
The Saleable tonnes cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnes using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account.
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnes.
Footnotes appear at the end of the section.
Metallurgical Coking refers to a high-, mediumor low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry: quality measured as Crucible Swell Number CSN.

Saleable reserve tonnes represents the product tonnes produced.
Coal Reserves ROM and Saleable are on the applicable moisture basis.
For the 2011 Reported and Attributable gures, please refer to the 2011 Annual Report.
3 ROM tonnes quoted on an As Delivered moisture basis, and Saleable tonnes on a Product moisture basis.
4 Yield ROM % represents the ratio of Saleable reserve tonnes to ROM reserve tonnes and is quoted on a constant moisture basis or on an air dried to air dried basis whereas Plant % is based on the Feed to Plant tonnes.
The product yields ROM % for Proved, Probable and Total are calculated by dividing the individual Saleable reserves by the total ROM reserves per classi cation.
5 The coal quality for the Coal Reserves is quoted as either Calori c Value CV using kilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg units on a Gross As Received GAR basis or Crucible Swell Number CSN.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Coking, Other Metallurgical and Export Thermal collieries meet the contractual speci cations for coking coal, PCI, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.

CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg.
8 Inferred in LOM Plan refers to Inferred Coal Resources that are included in the life of mine extraction schedule of the respective collieries and are not reported as Coal Reserves.
Inferred Coal Resources outside the Life of Mine Plan but within the mine lease area are not reported due to the uncertainty attached to such resources in that it cannot be assumed that all or part of the Inferred Resource will necessarily be upgraded to Indicated or Measured categories through continued exploration, such Inferred Resources do not necessarily meet the requirements of reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction, particularly in respect of future mining and processing economics.
Jellinbah is not reported as Anglo Americans shareholding is below the internal threshold for reporting.
Estimates for the following operations were updated by depletion and new geological models and revised Life of Mine Plans are scheduled for 2013: Callide, Capcoal OC, Capcoal UG, Foxleigh, Moranbah North and Trend.
Summary of material changes 10% in estimates at reporting level Dawson: Coal Reserves The increase is primarily due to the conversion of resources to reserves as a result of additional exploration drilling, a revised mine plan with an extended geographical area and extraction schedule as well as revised economic parameters.
Coal Resources The decrease is a result of the exploration programme and the subsequent resource model update.
The increased resource con dence enabled additional resources to be converted to reserves.
The extended geographical area resulted in replacement of Inferred due to the additional drilling.
Drayton: Coal Reserves Estimates from first principles using a revised mine plan results in a material decrease in reserves due to revised economic assumptions and additional exploration data.
Coal Resources The material decrease is due to conversion of Coal Reserves and revised economic assumptions.
Drayton South: Coal Resources The increase is primarily due to model re nement combination of plies into working sections for underground and open cut seams as well as additional exploration drilling and changes in geotechnical, environmental and resource utilisation considerations.
Moranbah South: Coal Resources The increase is due to additional exploration drilling and changed resource classi cation methodology to be consistent with Moranbah North and Grosvenor areas.
Roman Mountain: Coal Resources The increase is due to reinterpretation of the geological model and model re nement.
Assumption with respect to Mineral Tenure Callide: A Mining Lease Application has been lodged for the southern and eastern part of the Boundary Hill area and Metallurgical Coal has reasonable expectation that it will be granted.
