As at 31 January 2012, the Company had accumulated surplus expenses of 152.4 million 2011 - 142.8 million.
As at 31 January 2012 the Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 36.6 million 2011 - 38.5 million in respect of the accumulated expenses, based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 24% 2010 27%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and is effective from 1 April 2012.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% each year down to 22% by April 2014.
Provided the Company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that these expenses will be utilised and that the Company will obtain any benefit from this asset.
The Company will continue to seek approval under Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 for the current year and the foreseeable future.
The Company has not therefore provided for deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposals of investments.

Ordinary dividends paid by the Company carry a tax credit at a rate of 10%.
The credit discharges the tax liability of shareholders subject to income tax at less than the higher rate.
Shareholders liable to pay tax at the higher or additional rate will have further tax to pay.

Financial Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment policy as stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment policy, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are: market price risk, market yield risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors determine the objectives and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Directors, implements the Companys risk management policies.
The Companys policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments to moderate risk exposure and to generate additional revenue.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding period.
a Market Risk The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Market risk comprises market price risk, market yield risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
i Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
Where call options are sold written, in all cases a sufficient position is maintained in the underlying equity to cover any potential option exercise.
Whilst the option value can be volatile, price movements should to some extent be offset by opposing movements in the value of the underlying equity.
If options are retained until expiry they will either expire worthless or be exercised.
The effect of any option exercise is to sell the underlying shares at the strike price of the option.
A schedule of the Companys listed holdings is shown on pages 16 and 17.
Where put options are purchased, the market value of such options can be volatile but the maximum loss on any contract is limited to the original investment cost.
Further explanation of this derivative strategy is included in the Investment Managers Review on pages 12 and 13.
Falls in stock market valuations lead to changes in gearing ratios.
The Boards procedure for monitoring the gearing of the company is set out in Note 19 on page 63.
This takes into account the Investment Managers view on the market, covenant requirements and the future prospects of the Companys performance.
Market price risk sensitivity The value of the Companys listed investments i. e fixed asset investments, excluding unlisted equities which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January 2012 was as follows: 2012 2011 Listed investments held at fair value through profit or loss 512,041,586 543,212,051 Derivative financial instruments - written call options 291,625 307,947 Total listed investments 511,749,961 542,904,104 The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2011: 20% in the fair values of the Companys listed investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in recent years.
The sensitivity analysis on the net return after tax is based on the impact of a 20% increase or decrease in the value of the Companys listed equity investments at each closing balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.

A dedicated investment manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Call options are only written on stock owned within the portfolio with a maximum exposure of 15% of gross assets at the time of writing the call.
ii Market Yield Risk Market yield risk arises from the uncertainty about the Companys ability to maintain its income objectives due to systematic decline in corporate dividend levels.
Management of market yield risk The Directors regularly review the current and projected yield of the investment portfolio, and discuss with the Investment Manager the extent to which it will enable the Company to meet its investment income objective.
iii Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of the movement in the values of overseas financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates.
Management of foreign currency risk The Company invests predominantly in UK listed equities and has no significant exposure to currencies other than sterling 2011 - no significant exposure.
Any income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not hedge against foreign currency exposure.
iv Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.

The details in respect of the above loans have remained unchanged since the previous accounting period.
The weighted average effective rate of the Companys fixed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock and the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock is 8.54% 2011 - 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 12.2 years 2011 - 13.2 years.
The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
Therefore the Companys net return and net assets, are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
60 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2012 THE MERCHANTS TRUST PLC Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January Management of interest rate risk The Company invests predominantly in equities, the values of which are not directly affected by changes in prevailing market interest rates.
In the year to 31 January 2012, the Company held no fixed interest securities.
The Companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested and thus does not expect to hold significant cash balances.
The financial assets have minimal exposure to interest rate risk.
The Company finances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained revenue and long term borrowings.
Movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the finance costs and financial liabilities of the Company, as presented in the accounts, as all the borrowings of the Company are subject to fixed rates of interest.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk relates to the capacity to meet liabilities as they fall due and is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets.
Maturity of financial liabilities The table below presents the future cash flows payable by the Company in respect of its financial liabilities.
Cash flows in respect of the principal and interest on the Stepped Rate Interest Loan, Fixed Rate Interest Loan and 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 reflect the maturity dates as set out in Note 10 on pages 54 and 55.
The loans are each governed by a trust deed and only if the covenants are breached would early repayment be enforced.
Therefore their repayment is not considered to be a likely short term liquidity issue.
Cash flows in respect of the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock, which have no fixed repayment date, assumes maturity of 20 years from the balance sheet date.
Cash flows have not been discounted.

61 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year ended 31 January Management of liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not considered to be significant as the Companys assets mainly comprise realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility can be achieved through the use of overdraft facilities, where necessary.
As at the 31 January 2012, the Company had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of 10 million 2011 - 10 million.
c Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of default by a counterparty in discharging its obligations under transactions that could result in the Company suffering a loss Management of credit risk Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The credit ratings of brokers are reviewed quarterly by the Investment Manager.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by HSBC Bank PLC, rated Aa2 by Moodys rating agency.

The level of gearing is monitored, taking into account the Investment Managers view on the market and the future prospects of the Companys performance.
Capital management also involves reviewing the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price i. e. the level of share price discount or premium to assess the need to repurchase shares for cancellation.
The Company is subject to several externally imposed capital requirements: the bank borrowings under the overdraft facility are not to exceed 10m, and as a public company the minimum share capital is 50,000.
The Companys objective, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period, and the Company has complied with them.

These are measured in accordance with the policies used in the annual financial statements.
The Company has complied with these.

Fees paid to the Companys Board are disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 39.
