Segmental information Reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Group is organised on a geographical basis and derives its revenue from the provision of colocation and related services in Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
These geographical locations comprise the Groups segments.
Due to similarities in services, customers, regulatory environment and economic characteristics across the countries in which the Group operates, the Group aggregates these operating segments into the UK and the Rest of Europe.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The internal reporting principally analyses the performance of the UK and the Rest of Europe.
When further detail is required the results of individual countries are reviewed.
The Board has therefore determined the reportable segments to be the UK and the Rest of Europe.
The Groups income statement split by segment is shown below.
Treasury and financing is managed on a Group-wide basis, as such it is not practical to allocate costs below operating profit to an individual reporting segment.
The Group had no customers from which greater than 10% of revenue was derived during the year.
The Groups KPIs by reportable segment are shown below.
To the extent it is not practical to measure a KPI by reportable segment due to, for example, the common financing structure, the Group KPI is given.

Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.
Segment liabilities principally comprise trade and other payables, deferred income and provisions for other liabilities and charges.
Certain assets and liabilities, for example Group treasury cash balances and bank borrowings, are managed on a central basis and as such have not been allocated to individual segments.
Directors emoluments and key management compensation The Directors emoluments, including retirement benefits, are disclosed on page 65 within the Directors Remuneration Report, which forms part of the financial statements.
Key management compensation, which includes that of the executive and non-executive Directors, is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Salaries and other short-term employee benefits 2,438 2,331 Pension payments defined contribution plans 172 149 1 Share-based payment charges 777 636 3,387 3,116 1 The share-based payment charge is measured in line with the IFRS2 expense charged to the income statement during the year.

Exceptional items Exceptional items are disclosed separately in the financial statements where it is necessary to do so to provide further understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
They are material items of income or expense that have been shown separately due to the significance of their nature or amount.
During the year the Group acquired Tenue and Academica note 18.
As part of these transactions the Group incurred associated costs, mainly professional fees, stamp duty and restructuring costs, totalling 2,641,000.
The transaction-related expenses in respect of the prior year relate to the acquisition of Data Electronics and UK Grid.
In addition, in conducting the annual review of provisions held in respect of onerous leases note 25, the Group has increased the amounts provided in respect of certain leases.

Expenses analysed by nature The Group classifies its expenses by nature into the following categories.
Power costs represent the total cost of power to the Group including environmental taxes.
Property costs include rent payments, service charge and taxes in addition to ancillary property costs such as insurance.
Staff and staff-related costs include expenses such as training and recruitment in addition to the staff remuneration costs disclosed in note 6.
Other costs comprise operational maintenance costs, sales and administrative costs and cost of sales of services.

Finance costs Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Finance costs which are directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
The commencement of capitalisation begins when both finance costs and expenditure for the asset are being incurred and activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are in progress.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the asset ready for use are complete.
The interest rate charged on the capitalised interest was 4.7% 2011: 4.3%.
Tax relief is available on capitalised interest.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Interest payable on long-term loan 8,748 5,387 Interest payable on finance leases 512 137 Amortisation of loan arrangement costs 2,452 1,438 Gross cost of borrowings 11,712 6,962 Less interest capitalised note 16 5,376 2,493 Net cost of borrowings 6,336 4,469 Loan commitment fees 722 1,376 Unwinding of discounts in respect of onerous lease 168 271 Other 469 184 7,695 6,300 12.
Other financing items Other financing items represent finance costs or income not directly related to the Groups trading activity or financing, but those that are triggered as a result of external factors principally foreign exchange movements on financial assets and liabilities.
As such, these financing items are disclosed separately in the financial statements to provide a clearer understanding of the Groups underlying financing costs.
Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Net foreign exchange losses gains on financing items 515 276 13.
Income tax charge The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Income tax charge continued The tax recorded in the income statement on the Groups profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the weighted average tax rate applicable to profits of the Group as follows: Year ended 31 December 2012 Year ended 31 December 2011 Adjusted Adjustments Total Adjusted Adjustments Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Profit before tax 83,479 7,333 76,146 66,987 7,549 59,438 Multiplied by weighted average local tax rates 20,712 1,822 18,890 17,370 1,957 15,413 Items not taken into account for tax purposes and other timing differences 356 467 823 232 357 589 Adjustment in respect of prior years 574 574 1,065 1,065 Impact of change in the UK tax rate 319 782 1,101 270 270 20,175 2,137 18,038 18,397 1,600 16,797 The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
Accordingly, the Groups UK profits for 2012 were taxed at an effective rate of 24.5%.
Furthermore as a result of the change in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% that was substantively enacted on 26 June 2012 and that will be effective from 1 April 2013, the relevant deferred tax balances at 31 December 2012 have been re-measured at 23%.
Further reductions to the UK tax rate have been announced.
The changes, which are expected to be enacted separately each year, propose to reduce the rate to 21% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not recognised in these financial statements.
In addition to the amounts that have been charged to the income statement, the following amounts of tax have been charged directly to equity: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Current tax Share-based payment schemes 2,838 Deferred tax Share-based payment schemes 809 Tax effect of interest rate cash flow hedges 560 39 Tax on net investment items 1,375 4,207 1,414 The credit in respect of the share-based payment schemes relates to the expected future tax deduction the Group will receive when employees exercise options.
Deferred tax At the year end the Group recognised a net deferred tax liability of 16,015,000 2011: 12,093,000 mainly in respect of accelerated tax depreciation and intangible customer contract valuation, partially offset by tax losses.
The analysis of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Group 000 000 Deferred tax assets: deferred tax assets to be recovered after more than 12 months 1,525 1,837 deferred tax assets to be recovered within 12 months 3,602 4,096 5,127 5,933 Deferred tax liabilities: deferred tax liabilities to be recovered after more than 12 months 21,142 18,026 21,142 18,026 Deferred tax assets net 16,015 12,093 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 81 Notes to the financial statements continued 13.

In addition to the amounts recognised above, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of approximately 14,305,000 2011: 16,169,000 which relate to several of the Groups subsidiary companies.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated on the same basis but uses the adjusted profit attributable to equity holders of the Company.
The adjusted earnings per share is presented as the Directors consider it provides an additional indication of the underlying performance of the Group.
Adjusted earnings is calculated as shown in note 3.

Intangible assets The Groups intangible assets comprise goodwill and customer contracts and are treated as assets and liabilities of the entity to which they relate and are translated at the relevant closing foreign exchange rate.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identiable assets, including intangible assets, of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, represent customer contracts acquired during business combinations.
The customer contracts are initially recognised at fair value and amortised over estimated useful economic lives of between ten and 20 years, with current remaining lives of between four and 13 years 2011: five and 14 years.
The fair value is calculated by estimating the future cash flows expected to arise from the intangible asset and applying a suitable discount rate.

Impairment testing Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units CGU that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each country in which it has operations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
The main assumptions used when performing the impairment test are set out below.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value-in-use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
These calculations use pre-tax cash ow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period.
Cash ows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2011: 4% for both the UK and Rest of Europe.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the operating segment in which the CGU operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the pre-tax cash flow projections was 9.4% 2011: 10% for both the UK and rest of Europe.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reect specic risks relating to the relevant segments.
A segmentlevel summary of goodwill allocation is presented below: Year ended 31 December 2012 Year ended 31 December 2011 Rest of Rest of UK Europe Total UK Europe Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Goodwill 42,454 63,014 105,468 42,454 54,199 96,653 The Group assesses at each reporting date whether its customer contracts intangible assets may be impaired.
If any such indicator exists, the Group tests for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value of an asset an impairment loss is recognised.

Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises their purchase cost, together with the costs of installation and directly attributable external and internal costs, such as staff and property rentals, incurred during the construction or commissioning phase.
Additions to property, plant and equipment also include capitalised finance costs.
When property, plant and equipment is acquired as part of a business combination, the cost of such assets is deemed to be their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated from the date an asset becomes available for use, so as to write off the difference between the cost of the asset and the residual value over its expected useful economic life.
The expected period of the property leases in which an asset is located is taken into account when determining useful economic life of the asset.
The principal periods over which assets are depreciated are: Freehold land and buildings Freehold land is not depreciated, freehold property is depreciated over 50 years Leasehold improvements 730 years straight-line Plant and machinery 520 years straight-line Ofce equipment 35 years straight-line Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Once such assets are brought into use, such assets are transferred into the appropriate asset class and depreciated over their expected useful economic life.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and, if appropriate, adjusted on a prospective basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Such assets are categorised as plant and machinery in the above table.
Included within additions to assets in the course of construction for the year are capitalised finance and other costs principally rent and rates incurred during the construction or commissioning phase in respect of the Groups new data centres, totalling 5,376,000 and 3,670,000 respectively 2011: 2,493,000 and 2,000,000.
The interest rate charged on the capitalised interest is disclosed in note 11.
The Company does not hold any property, plant and equipment.

18. Business combinations During the year the Group made two acquisitions in Finland, Tenue on 6 August 2012 and Academica on 5 November 2012.
In both cases the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of the company.
Both businesses operate in the carrier-neutral data centre market and are considered complementary strategic fits within the Group that offer the opportunity for growth in Finland and an opportunity to capture the growth in Russian internet traffic.
Due to the proximity of the acquisitions, the relatively small size of the Tenue deal and the similarity of the businesses, combined disclosures have been given for the acquisitions.
The total cash consideration was 25.9m and the fair value of net assets acquired was 16.1m.
The Group expects much of the value relating to these acquisitions will arise from executing the expansion plans that are in place.
The goodwill is attributable to the operating cash flows of new customer contracts expected to be signed post-acquisition relating to such expansions.
The combined results of Tenue and Academica from the start of their financial years, 1 January, to the date of acquisition, along with the post-acquisition results, is summarised below.
These amounts have been calculated before allocation of the Groups central costs, using the Groups accounting policies and by adjusting the results to reflect the depreciation and amortisation that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant and equipment had applied from 1 January 2012, together with the consequential tax effects.

Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Leasing agreements that transfer to the Group substantially all the benets and risks of ownership of an asset are classified as a finance lease and treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown within obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged to the income statement in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.

The bank borrowings attract interest at LIBOR, or equivalent based on the currency of the borrowing herein referred to as LIBOR, plus a margin.
The margin is variable and calculated with reference to the ratio of the Groups last twelve months EBITDA to net debt.
The margin is recalculated based on interest periods set by the Group, typically between one and three months.
The borrowings are secured by a debenture over all the assets of the Company, including shares in, and assets of, certain subsidiary undertakings.
The Directors consider the carrying value of the borrowings to approximate to their fair values as they attract a market rate of interest.
The Group has three principal banking covenants under its senior debt facility which are outlined below: Total leverage: the Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio is covenanted to not breach certain levels.
Fixed charge cover: the Groups interest and rent expenses fixed charge must be covered by a multiple of pre-rent and interest earnings.
Total cash cover: the Groups interest cost must be covered by a multiple of cash flows, excluding certain permitted capital expenditure.
At the year end, the Group is in full compliance with these covenants and expects to remain so for the foreseeable future.
Lease liabilities are effectively secured as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.
The maturity prole of borrowings is set out below: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Within one year 2,551 2,551 In one to two years 2,616 2,001 In two to three years 2,532 9,989 In three to four years 18,365 17,982 In four to five years 254,456 157,803 After five years 725 2,373 Gross borrowings 281,245 192,699 Less future interest and unamortised debt issue costs 6,075 6,697 Net borrowings 275,170 186,002 Amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility are included in the above analysis with reference to the term for which the Group can continue to roll such amounts.

Borrowings continued The Group uses interest rate swaps to fix the LIBOR rate it pays on its borrowings.
The split of borrowings between fixed and variable is shown below: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Fixed rate borrowings 210,377 116,277 Variable rate borrowings 64,793 69,725 275,170 186,002 Percentage of borrowings at fixed rate 76.5 62.5 The Group has undrawn committed loan facilities at the year end as shown below: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 000 000 Senior debt facility 350,000 300,000 Finance lease facility 26,250 22,500 Gross borrowings drawn 281,245 192,699 Rental guarantees issued under senior debt facility 5,493 5,508 Undrawn committed loan facility 89,512 124,293 A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn committed facilities at a rate of 45% 2011: 45% of the applicable margin.
Derivative financial instruments Interest rate derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and subsequent to initial recognition are revalued at each reporting date.
The fair value is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the relevant date.
Amounts payable and receivable on interest rate derivatives are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Where the instrument meets the definition for hedge accounting, movements in fair value of the interest rate swap are taken to reserves.
In all other cases movements are charged or credited to the income statement.
In order to manage the Groups exposure to movements in LIBOR, or equivalent based on the currency of the borrowing herein referred to as LIBOR, the Group uses interest rate swaps.
Under these arrangements the Group pays interest at a fixed rate and receives interest at LIBOR.
The amounts of interest paid and received are calculated on the nominal value of the interest rate swap.
After taking account of the effect of the interest rate swaps, the average interest rate in respect of drawn borrowings was 4.0% 2011: 4.3%.
At the year end the Group had the following contracts outstanding: At 31 December 2012 Nominal value 000 Currency Maturity date Fixed rate 72,000 Sterling 12 February 2013 2.235% 20,000 Sterling 20 February 2013 1.133% 1 92,000 Sterling 13 February 2015 1.355% 40,000 Euro 5 October 2014 1.505% 44,000 Euro 13 February 2015 1.225% 400,000 Swedish krona 28 February 2015 2.180% 1 This instrument has a start date of 13 February 2013.

Provisions for other liabilities and charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.
After initial measurement, any subsequent adjustments to dilapidations provisions are normally recorded against the original amount included in leasehold improvements with a corresponding adjustment to future depreciation charges.

The dilapidations provision relates to the estimated costs of returning one of the Groups properties to its original condition at the expiry of the lease in two years time.
The Directors consider the carrying values of the provisions to approximate to their fair values as they have been discounted at the risk free rate.

Share capital An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Shares held in the Employee Benefit Trust EBT over which the Group has direct or indirect control are deducted from the reserves of the Group.

Share plans Under the Groups long-term incentive plans, performance shares and share options are granted to senior management.
In addition, the Group operates a sharesave scheme which is available to all staff.
The details of the share option schemes are contained in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 64.
The release of these shares is conditional upon continued employment, certain market vesting conditions and, in the case of enhanced awards, three-year target EPS compound annual growth rates.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined, using the Black Scholes or Monte Carlo models, at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
Non-market vesting conditions, which for the Group mainly relate to the continual employment of the employee during the vesting period, and in the case of the enhanced awards the achievement of EPS growth targets, are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options that eventually vest.
Any market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted.
To the extent that share options are granted to employees of the Groups subsidiaries without charge, the share option charge is capitalised as part of the cost of investment in subsidiaries.

Share plans continued Performance shares granted during the current and previous year were valued using the Monte Carlo option-pricing model.
The grants under the sharesave scheme during the year were valued using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in these calculations are as follows: April 2012 February February November Enhanced 2012 March 2011 2012 Performance Performance 2011 Performance Grant date Sharesave shares shares Sharesave shares Share price 8.82 7.45 6.83 4.72 5.03 Exercise price 7.09 nil nil 3.74 Nil Expected volatility % 32.1 31.6 32.6 46.3 46.8 Expected life years 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Risk free rate % 0.42 0.59 0.57 1.71 1.96 Expected dividend yield % 1.0 1.0 1.0 nil nil Fair value per option 2.35 5.59 4.03 1.95 3.43 Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo models for the total shareholder return elements of the long-term incentive plan in determining the fair value at grant date.

The risk free return has been determined from market yield curves of government gilts with outstanding expected terms for each relevant grant.
The charge arising from share-based payments is disclosed in note 6.
Reserves The Group and the Company Statements of Changes in Equity are disclosed as primary statements on page 70.
Below is a description of the nature and purpose of the individual reserves: share capital represents the nominal value of shares issued, including those issued to the EBT note 26 : share premium account includes the amounts paid over nominal value in respect of share issues, net of related costs: retained profits include the accumulated realised and certain unrealised gains and losses made by the Company and the Group: own shares held by the Group represent 222,000 2011: 1,149,000 shares in Telecity Group plc.
All shares are held by the EBT.
These shares are listed on a recognised stock exchange and their market value and nominal value at 31 December 2011 was 1,742,000 2011: 7,432,000 and 443 2011: 2,000 respectively.
The EBT is a discretionary trust for the benefit of employees and the shares held are used to satisfy some of the Groups obligations to employees for share options and other long-term incentive plans: currency translation differences on foreign currency net investments arise from the re-translation of the net investments in overseas subsidiaries, including long-term intercompany loans that are considered part of the Groups investment in its subsidiaries: and the Companys other reserve represents the cumulative share-based payment charged to reserves.

Contingent liabilities Financial guarantees granted by the Groups banks primarily in respect of operating leases amount to 5,493,000 at 31 December 2012 2011: 5,508,000.
At the inception of a property lease and annually thereafter, the Directors assess the cost of restoring leasehold premises to their original condition at the end of the lease and the likelihood of such costs actually being incurred.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be possible, rather than probable, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.
When assessing the likely duration of the lease and the likelihood of this liability arising, the Directors take into account their contractual and statutory rights to renew or extend the lease terms.
If the likelihood of this liability arising is judged to be probable, the discounted cost of the liability is included in leasehold improvements and is depreciated over the duration of the lease.
At 31 December 2012 the estimated discounted cost of reinstating leasehold properties at the end of leases in accordance with the lease contracts amounted to 9,180,000 2011: 7,513,000.
In addition to this, 1,557,000 2011: 1,557,000 is recorded within provisions note 25.
The leases expire over a range of one to 30 years.
Related party transactions The Directors have not identified any related parties and transactions other than the remuneration of key management, which is disclosed in note 5.
Post balance sheet events The Directors have reviewed events occurring after the balance sheet and determined that no such events require adjustment to, or disclosure in, the financial statements.
