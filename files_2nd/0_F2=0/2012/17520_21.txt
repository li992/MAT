Impairment testing continued Sensitivity to changes in assumptions A significant amount of commodity price and foreign exchange volatility continues to exist in the market.
Adverse changes in key assumptions as described above could result in changes to impairment charges specifically in relation to Coppers Americas and Zinc Lead.
The impairment tests are particularly sensitive to changes in commodity prices, discount rates and foreign exchange rates.
Changes to these assumptions could have resulted in changes to impairment charges.
The table below summarises the change required to key assumptions that would result in the carrying value equalling the recoverable values: Change in the key assumption that would result in the recoverable amount Excess of equalling the carrying value % recoverable amount over Foreign carrying value Commodity Discount exchange US$m prices rate rate 2012 Copper Americas 9,823 11% 15% 15% Zinc Lead 3 Amounts relate to absolute movement in discount rate.

For the purposes of testing for impairment of goodwill using the VIU basis for chrome, the excess of recoverable amount over the carrying value was US$3,158 million 2011 US$4,027 million and management is of the opinion that no reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions could result in an impairment expense being recognised.
Other non-current asset impairments The impairment losses reversals recognised as exceptional items in the income statement refer to note 10, excluding the goodwill impairment above, relate to the following: Impairment method 2012 2011 US$m Alloys Africa FVLCS 81 Nickel Americas North FVLCS 392 Nickel Australasia FVLCS 447 469 Nickel Europe FVLCS 71 FVLCS 528 6 Alloys Africa VIU 840 1,368 6 Where used, FVLCS was calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology taking account of assumptions that would be made by market participants.
For VIU impairment, a pre-tax discount rate of 9.7% was used.

Investment in associates Lonmin plc During 2012, an impairment charge of US$840 million was recorded in respect of the Groups investment in Lonmin following the release of their 2012 results and the challenging outlook for the industry, resulting in revisions to forecast capital expenditure, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, operating costs and production refer to note 10.
In November the Group fully subscribed to Lonmins 9 for 5 rights issue which increased the Groups investment in Lonmin by US$202 million.
The Group believes that the post-impairment recoverable amount of the investment using the VIU method was higher than the value based on the listed share price at that date because this share price continues to reflect ongoing uncertainty and volatility in world economic markets as opposed to the fundamental long-term value of this investment, therefore the updated carrying value is supported on a VIU basis.
The share price of Lonmin as listed on the London Stock Exchange at 31 December 2012 was GBP2.84 per share 2011 GBP9.80 per share.
The carrying amount of Lonmin at 31 December 2012 was US$771 million 2011 US$1,536 million.
The Group held 139.5 million 2011: 49.8 million shares in Lonmin plc at 31 December 2012.
Other associates The Groups other associates are refer to note 35 : interests in coal terminals Newcastle Coal Shippers Pty Ltd, Port Kembla Coal Terminal Limited, WICET Holdings Pty Ltd and Richards Bay Coal Terminal Company Ltd, through which it gains access to export markets: and a 25% interest in the Noranda Income Fund which owns a zinc refinery in , Quebec.
The Group held 12.5 million 2011: 12.5 million units in the Noranda Income Fund and the unit price as listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 31 December 2012 was CAD4.74 per unit 2011 CAD5.68 per unit.
The Group has determined that the recoverable amount of the investment calculated using the VIU method is higher than the value based on the listed unit price because of the continued uncertainty and volatility in world economic markets.
The companies which own the coal terminals are not listed so there is no published quoted price for the value of these investments.
The Group estimates that the carrying value of these investments is at least equal to fair value.

The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans which are outlined below.
There have been no cancellations or modifications to any of the plans during 2012 or 2011.
Xstrata plc Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP has two elements: i a contingent award of free ordinary shares that vests after three years, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied: and ii an option to acquire ordinary shares at a specified exercise price after the third anniversary of grant, subject to, and to the extent that, performance criteria determined at the time of grant have been satisfied.
All LTIP awards that vest are subject to the satisfaction of certain performance criteria being met over a three-year performance period.
Half of the options and free share awards granted to corporate employees are conditional on TSR relative to a peer group, with the remainder conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale over the three-year period.
75% of options and free shares awarded to business unit employees are conditional on achieving real cost savings and the remaining 25% are conditional on TSR performance criteria.
All LTIP options and free shares vest immediately on loss of control.
The allocation of performance criteria pertaining to the options and free share awards granted in 2011 and 2012 is summarised in the following table: Xstrata | Annual Report 2012 | www.
com 115 Notes to the financial statements continued 34.
Awards which vest prior to the completion of the merger are conditional on TSR, one-half of the award will vest if TSR growth is at the median of the specified peer group, the full award will vest for performance at or above the second decile, with straight-line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur for below median performance.
For the awards where vesting is conditional on the Groups real cost savings relative to targets set on a stretching scale: 10% of the award will vest for 1% cost savings, 70% for 2% cost savings and all awards for 3% or more cost savings, with straight-line vesting between these points.
No vesting will occur if cost savings are less than 1%.
Real cost savings are measured in relation to operating costs after adjusting for the effects of inflation, excluding depreciation, commodity price-linked costs, effects of currencies on translation of local currency costs, and planned life-of-mine adjustments.
No other features of the LTIP awards are incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
No consideration will be payable on the vesting of an LTIP award of free ordinary shares.
On exercise of an option, a participant will be required to pay an exercise price that is based on the closing market price of an ordinary share seven trading days prior to the date of grant.
Of the options listed below, 3.2 million 2011: 6.4 million are accounted for as cash-settled share-based awards whilst the remainder of the LTIP awards are equity-settled.
The movements in the number of free ordinary shares and share options are as follows: Free shares 2012 2011 Number Number Outstanding as at 1 January 16,217,594 14,264,247 Granted during the year 5,547,010 3,448,129 Forfeited during the year 996,063 630,553 1 2 Exercised during the year 7,288,245 864,229 3 3 Outstanding as at 31 December 13,480,296 16,217,594 Exercisable at 31 December 718,305 324,669 1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these awards was GBP11.45.

3 All shares included in this balance have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The weighted average remaining contractual life for the free shares outstanding as at 31 December 2012 is 8 years 2011: 8 years.
The weighted average fair value of free shares granted during the year was GBP9.95 per share 2011 GBP12.14 per share.
2 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise of these options was GBP14.20.
3 All the share options included in this balance have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payments, except for nil options 2011: 50,229 options issued in 2002.
com The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 31 December 2012 was 7 years 2011: 7 years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was GB5.12 2011 GBP6.98.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was GBP1.82 to GBP20.02 2011 GBP1.82 to GBP20.02.
The following table lists the inputs to the models used to measure the fair value of equity-settled awards granted: Date of grant Date of grant 2012 2011 Dividend yield % 2.5 1.4 Expected volatility % 69 74 Risk-free interest rate % 0.6 2.5 Earliest exercise date 17 Feb 15 18 Feb 14 Latest exercise date 17 Feb 22 18 Feb 21 Expected exercise date 3 Dec 15 3 Dec 14 Share price at date of grant GBP 11.96 14.30 Exercise price GBP 11.94 14.68 Free share fair value at date of grant GBP 11.09 13.72 Option fair value at date of grant GBP 5.31 7.26 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historic volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Both the free shares and the equity-settled options are equity-settled plans and the fair value is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value of the cash-settled options is measured at the date of grant and at each reporting date until the liability is settled, using binomial models, taking into account the terms and conditions of the award.
At 31 December 2012 the provision held for cash settled awards was US$26 million 2011 US$42 million refer to note 31.
Deferred bonus As detailed within the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 58, the maximum bonus payable under the bonus plan for executive directors and the members of the Executive Committee is 300% of salary.
Bonuses are payable in three tranches as follows: the maximum bonus, which any one participant is eligible to receive in cash, will be limited to 100% of the individuals base salary: any additional bonus up to a further 100% of base salary will be deferred for a period of one year: any remaining bonus will be deferred for a period of two years: and in a year which includes a likely change of control, the Remuneration Committee has the ability to award a bonus of up to 300% of salary in cash with no deferred element.
The deferred elements up to the 2011 awards have taken the form of awards of Xstrata shares conditional on the participant remaining in employment throughout the deferral period.
The number of shares awarded will be determined by reference to the market value of the shares at the date concurrent awards under the LTIP are made.
The deferred elements have been treated as an equity-settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2.
During the bonus deferral period dividend equivalents accrue and are delivered at the end of the deferral period, subject to the deferral award vesting.
As dividend equivalents are receivable on the deferred amounts, the fair value of the deferral is technically equal to the value of the bonuses deferred.
The following deferred bonus awards have been made: 2012 2011 2010 Market value of deferred bonus award US$m 21 18 Number of shares purchased 1,119,976 777,678 Chief Executives Added Value Plan AVP The AVP is a long-term incentive and retention plan for the Chief Executive which rewards outperformance in creating additional long-term shareholder value over the value created by Xstrata plcs peer companies refer to the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 58 and aligns interests with shareholders by means of share ownership by the Chief Executive.
Performance is assessed over periods of three years and five years from the grant date of each cycle and is based upon the growth in the Companys TSR over the relevant performance period relative to an index of global mining companies, which form the Xstrata TSR index.
A description of the performance requirements and the vesting schedule of the plan are detailed within the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 58.
The first cycle of the AVP began in 2005 and occurred annually until 2009 after which no further awards were granted.
For the single remaining outstanding plan cycle granted in 2009, the market capitalisation on 17 April 2009 was US$21.7 billion, the participation percentage was equal to 0.3% and the share price at the measurement date was US$8.73 post-rights issue.
On 17 April 2012, the 2009 interim award vested and 50% of the interim award was cash-settled as detailed in the Remuneration report on pages 45 to 58.
The remaining 50% of the interim award of the 2009 AVP cycle will be settled as 834,498 nil-cost options exercisable in April 2013 and 834,498 nil-cost options exercisable in April 2014.
The deferred portion of the award will vest immediately on loss of control.
Due to underlying performance criteria the 2009 plan cycle does not progress to a final award stage.

Employee benefits continued The fair value of all awards, which were accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments up to 17 April 2012 to reflect the expected form of settlement, were estimated in accordance with IFRS 2 using a Monte Carlo simulation model to incorporate the market-based features of the plan.
The following table presents the fair value of the award at grant date and the value of the unvested portion of each cycle if conditions that existed at 31 December are those at the time of vesting.
Value of unvested award based Estimated Plan cycle on conditions at 31 December fair value Grant date at grant date 2012 2011 US$m 2009 17 Apr 2009 135 32 This amount represents the value of the award if it had vested as at 31 December 2011.
In accordance with IFRS 2 as it applies to cash-settled share-based payments, a provision was recognised based on the fair value of each cycle adjusted for the vesting period yet to lapse.
This model determined the fair value of each cycle at 31 December 2011 to estimate the final performance of the Group and its performance relative to its peers.
At 31 December 2012, the total provision held for the AVP was US$nil 2011 US$44 million representing only the 2009 plan refer to note 31.
The decrease in the provision during the year reflects the settlement for cash of 50% of the interim award and the reversal of the remaining provision as the deferred element of the award is accounted as an equity-settled share-based payment.
To account for the deferred portion, nil-cost options have been valued based on the underlying share price as at the date of grant at 18 April 2012 GBP11.38.
The following table lists the inputs to the models used to measure the fair value of the AVP award at grant date: 2009 Xstrata share 1 Xstrata plc indices 2 Dividend yield % N A N A 3 Expected volatility to interim vesting % 76 53 3 Expected volatility to final vesting % 62 43 Risk-free interest rate to interim vesting % 2.4 2.4 Risk-free interest rate to final vesting % 2.6 2.6 Third anniversary of start of cycle 17 April 2012 17 April 2012 Fourth anniversary of start of cycle 17 April 2013 17 April 2013 Fifth anniversary of start of cycle 17 April 2014 17 April 2014 1 There are two Xstrata share indices used within the valuation model: one is a market capitalisation weighted TSR index comprising 16 global mining firms considered to be Xstratas key competitors for both financial and human capital, the other is a market capitalisation price index comprising the same global mining firm constituents.
2 When simulating the Xstrata price index, a dividend yield is included to account for the suppressing impact that a dividend payment has on the constituent share prices.
For the simulation of Xstratas TSR and the Index TSR, a dividend yield is not required as TSR comprises share price growth and dividend distributions which are assumed to be reinvested into the shares.
3 Volatility is calculated using daily historic share price data over the period up to the measurement date that is equal in length to the expected remaining life of the award.

Financial instruments Principles of risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.
These risks arise from exposures that occur in the normal course of business and are managed by the Treasury Committee, which operates as a sub-committee of the Executive Committee.
The responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include the recommendation of policies to manage financial instrument risks.
These recommendations are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors and implemented by the Groups Treasury Department.
The overall objective of the Treasury Committee is to effectively manage credit risk, liquidity risk and other market risks in accordance with the Groups strategy.
Other responsibilities of the Treasury Committee include management of the Groups cash resources and debt funding programmes, approval of counter-parties and relevant transaction limits and the monitoring of all significant treasury activities undertaken by the Group.
The Group uses both conventional financial instruments and derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
The Groups Treasury Department prepares monthly treasury reports which monitor all significant treasury activities undertaken by Group companies.
The report also benchmarks significant treasury activities.
The Treasury Committee and Executive Committee review these reports to monitor the financial instrument risks of the Group and to ensure compliance with established Group policies and procedures.
The Groups significant financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, capital market notes, finance leases, hire purchase contracts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups acquisitions and ongoing operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
Derivative transactions are entered into solely to mitigate risks and hedge accounting under IAS 39 is only applied when certain criteria have been met.
Market fluctuations in derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are used to offset the fluctuations in the underlying exposure.
The Group does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 6. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets.
Investments in cash, short-term deposits, derivative instruments and similar assets are with approved counterparty banks and other financial institutions.
Counterparties are assessed prior to, during, and after the conclusion of transactions to ensure exposure to credit risk is limited to an acceptable level.
The Groups major exposure to credit risk is in respect of trade receivables.
Given the geographical industry spread of the Groups ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited.
Past the due date but not impaired Neither impaired nor Between Between Between past the Less than 30 and 91 and 181 and More than due date 30 days 90 days 180 days 365 days 1 year Total US$m Trade debtors: 2012 2,602164563819 2,879 2011 2,76513369634 33,037 The credit quality of the Groups significant customers is monitored on an ongoing basis by the Credit Department.
Receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of high credit quality.
There were no material impairments of trade debtors as at 31 December 2012 or 2011.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
No collateral is held in respect of impaired assets or assets that are past due but not impaired.
Details of guarantees material to the Group are outlined in note 33.
Where concentrations of credit risk exist, management closely monitors the receivable and ensures appropriate controls are in place to ensure recovery.
A portion of the Groups revenues is generated from sales to Glencore, a related party.
These sales are governed by various sales, marketing and distribution agreements as outlined in note 35.
In general, Glencore acts as a sales and marketing agent, on-selling purchases from the Group to a wide variety of purchasers.
As these agreements have been in place for a number of years and the Group has not been exposed to significant unrecoverable amounts, the Group does not believe these arrangements expose it to unacceptable credit risks.
Credit risk is minimal and not concentrated for other financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the total carrying value of financial assets on the balance sheet as at the reporting date, being an amount of US$8,273 million 2011 US$7,716 million.
The Group does not have netting agreements with any debtors.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
The Groups Treasury Department is responsible for management of liquidity risk, including funding, settlements, related processes and policies.
The Group manages its liquidity risk on a consolidated basis utilising various sources of finance to maintain flexibility while ensuring access to cost-effective funds when required.
The operational, tax, capital and regulatory requirements and obligations of the Group are considered in the management of liquidity risk.
Capital commitments see note 33 will be met using a combination of debt and operational cashflows.
In addition, management utilises both short and long-term cash flow forecasts and other consolidated financial information to manage liquidity risk.
The Groups Treasury Department monitors the Groups long-term credit ratings from major ratings agencies including Standard & Poors and Moodys when assessing the ongoing credit-worthiness of the Group.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had long-term credit ratings of BBB watch negative from Standard & Poors 2011 BBB stable outlook and Baa2 stable outlook from Moodys 2011 Baa2 positive outlook and A low from DBRS 2011 A low.
The ratings agencies consider a number of qualitative measurements when assessing the credit-worthiness of a company.
These include an assessment of the quality of assets and management, attitudes to risk, industry type and the performance of a company in relation to its peers.
They also examine a number of financial ratios such as leverage, debt to operating cash flow, interest coverage, total liabilities to total assets and return on invested capital.
The Groups Treasury Department continuously monitors the Groups performance relative to these ratios as a guide to the ongoing credit-worthiness of the Group.
The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
This ensures flexibility to minimise liquidity risk and ensures the ongoing solvency of the Group.

Amounts in foreign currency are each translated at the closing rate at the reporting date.
The variable interest payments arising from the financial instruments were calculated using interest rates as at the reporting date.
Financial liabilities that can be repaid at any time are always assigned to the earliest possible time period.
Future forecast transactions or transactions subsequent to year end are not included.
Market risk analysis IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant market risk variables on the Groups profit and shareholders equity.
The periodic effects are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in the risk variables to the balance of financial instruments at the reporting date.
The Groups primary market exposures are to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of exposures to movements in the LIBOR.
It is the Groups preference to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest, notwithstanding that some borrowings are at fixed rates.
In addition, a limited amount of fixed rate hedging may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant.
In keeping with the Groups preference to borrow at floating rates of interest, the following interest rate swap contracts were outstanding at 31 December 2012 and 2011: Principal Average Fair Principal Average Fair amount rate % value amount rate % value 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 US$m At fair value: Interest rate swap from US$ fixed rates: Maturing in less than 1 year 925 1.44 36 Maturing between 2 and 3 years 1,430 1.99 151 Maturing between 3 and 4 years 4,198 1.57 162 1,430 2.29 171 Maturing between 4 and 5 years 675 1.07 142 1,000 1.35 177 Maturing greater than 5 years 3,732 2.64 210 1,660 2.31 314 Interest rate swap to US$ fixed rates: Maturing in less than 1 year 100 4.54 2 10,035 1.99 665 5,115 2.00 696 Relates to the unsecured notes and senior debentures refer to note 28.

The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant national inter-bank rates and re-priced at least annually.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
IFRS 7 requires interest rate sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of changes in market interest rates on the income statement and, if appropriate, shareholders equity.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: for non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rate terms, a change in market interest rates only affects income if these are measured at their fair value.
Consequently, all non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rate terms that are carried at amortised cost are excluded from this analysis with the exception of those subject to a fixed to floating rate swap : items subject to an effective fixed to floating interest rate swap hedge are assumed to be floating instruments for the purpose of this analysis: for floating rate instruments, income statement impacts assume adjustments to interest income and expense for a 12-month period: the Group does not have significant cash flow hedges related to interest rate risk.
As such, movements that would occur in equity as a result of a hypothetical change in interest rates at reporting date have been excluded from this analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective with no impact on the income statement or equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships are assumed to impact the income statement: the Group does not have material exposure to interest rate risk from available-for-sale financial instruments.
As such, these financial instruments have been excluded from this analysis: the balance of interest-bearing financial instruments at reporting date is representative of the balance for the year as a whole and hypothetical interest rate movements are deemed to apply for the entire reporting period: and the impact of interest rate movements on the carrying value of pension obligations has been excluded.
com 133 Notes to the financial statements continued 36.
Financial instruments continued If the market interest rates had been 100 basis points higher lower at 31 December 2012 income would have been US$78 million 2011 US$51 million higher lower.
There would be no material effect on equity reserves other than those relating directly to movements in the income statement.
Foreign currency risk Owing to the Groups significant operations in Australia, North America, South America, South Africa and Europe, the balance sheet and results can be affected significantly by movements in exchange rates.
The long-term relationship between commodity prices and the currencies of most of the countries where the Group operates provides a degree of natural protection.
However, in the short term it can be quite volatile.
The presentation currency of the Group is the US$.
Foreign currency hedges Group subsidiaries located in Australia and Canada have entered into AUD US$ and CAD US$ exchange contracts to hedge a portion of their US$ denominated revenue and third-party loans.
The Group also enters into forward contracts to hedge specific one-off foreign currency transactions.
The open foreign currency exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 are as follows: Classified as cash flow hedges : Contract Average Fair Contract Average Fair amount forward rate value amount forward rate value 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 US$m Forward contracts sell US$ buy AUD: Maturing in less than 1 year 1,261 1.0216 14 1,932 1.0017 24 1,261 1.0216 14 1,932 1.0017 24 Forward contracts sell US$ buy EUR: Maturing in less than 1 year 675 1.3500 27 Maturing between 2 and 3 years 939 1.5650 148 Maturing between 3 and 4 years 1,599 1.2795 50 939 1.5650 161 Maturing between 4 and 5 years 675 1.3500 15 Maturing after 5 years 1,280 1.2795 40 675 1.3500 27 4,493 1.3498 73 2,289 1.4382 215 Forward contracts sell US$ buy GBP: Maturing after 5 years 985 1.9700 172 985 1.9700 208 985 1.9700 172 985 1.9700 208 Forward contracts sell US$ buy ZAR: Maturing in less than 1 year 552 8.6177 6 547 7.9437 20 552 8.6177 6 547 7.9437 20 Relates to the Unsecured notes refer to note 28.

The movements shown below largely result from trade payables and receivables that are not denominated in the local entitys functional currency.
Trade payables and receivables generally arise as a result of the operations of the Group in the ordinary course of business.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements of subsidiaries or joint ventures into the Groups presentation currency, US$, are not taken into consideration: the major currency exposures for the Group relate to the US$ and local currencies of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Foreign currency exposures between two currencies where one is not the US$ are deemed insignificant to the Group and have therefore been excluded from the sensitivity analysis: derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective hedges and therefore any movements in carrying value are captured within equity and have no impact on the income statement analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective with no impact on the income statement or equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships are assumed to impact the income statement: and the impact of foreign currency movements on the carrying value of pension obligations has been excluded.
com In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2012.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
If the US$ had gained lost 5% against all currencies significant to the Group, the impact would have been: Closing Effect on net Effect on Closing Effect on net Effect on exchange earnings of a equity of a exchange earnings of a equity of a rate 5% change 5% change rate 5% change 5% change 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 Local currency to the US$ US$:ARS 4.9155 22 4.3063 7 AUD:US$ 1.0395 44 1 1.0205 55 2 US$:CAD 0.9922 8 1.0212 5 US$:CLP 478.71 7 519.50 5 EUR:US$ 1.3193 4 1.2960 4 US$:PEN 2.5525 3 2.6904 4 US$:ZAR 8.4575 12 1 8.0796 17 2 Total 32 2 49 4 Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, with the commodity mix spread between those that are priced by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets and those that are set on a contract basis with customers, generally on an annual basis.
Commodity price risks arise in all major commodities that the Group produces.
Commodity price risk is managed by maintaining a diversified portfolio of commodities and typically does not involve large-scale strategic hedging or price management initiatives.
Due to the volatile nature of commodity prices and the historical relationship between prices and the currencies of most of the countries where the Group operates, hedging may be entered into only in limited circumstances and subject to strict limits laid down by the Board of Directors.
Commodity hedging The Australian and South African operations have entered into coal forwards to hedge prices of future sales of coal.
The open forwards and collars commodity contracts as at 31 December 2012 are as follows: Classified as cash flow hedges: Average Fair value Average Fair value Tonnes price US$ US$m Tonnes price US$ US$m 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 Coal forwards US$ denominated contracts: FOB Maturing in less than 1 year 3,190,000 98.32 154,590,000 114.72 31 Maturing between 1 and 2 years 90,000 124.00 1 3,190,000 98.32 154,680,000 114.90 32 The maturities of these hedges reflect the expected timing of cash flows related to these instruments.
The IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis below has been prepared using the following assumptions: this analysis only takes into account commodities for which the Group has significant exposure: fixed-price sale and purchases contracts will not fluctuate with movements in commodity prices and are therefore excluded from this analysis: derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective hedges and therefore any movements in carrying value are captured within equity and have no impact on the income statement analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective with no impact on the income statement or equity: and changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships are assumed to impact the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2012.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
If prices for all commodities for which the Group has significant exposure had been 10% higher lower at 31 December 2012, income would have been US$189 million higher lower 2011 US$194 million higher lower and equity reserves would have been US$1 million lower higher 2011 US$20 million lower higher as a result of changes to reserves for commodity cash flow hedges.
There would be no other material changes in reserves of the Group as at 31 December 2012 or 2011 other than those relating directly to income statement movements.

The Group uses various valuation techniques in determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
The following fair value hierarchy is used to categorise and disclose the Groups financial assets and liabilities held at fair value for which a valuation technique is used: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
