Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified for measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value and in accordance with applicable UK law and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
As the Company is included in the consolidated financial statements, made up to 31 December each year, it is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Cash flow statement The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements from the requirement to publish its own cash flow statement, as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow statement of the Group.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Purchased goodwill, representing the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired, is written off on a straight line basis from the date of acquisition over 20 years, being its anticipated useful life.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all other assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed asset investments, including investment in subsidiaries, are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a firstinfirstout basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.

Significant accounting policies continued Trade and other debtors Trade debtors, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Company has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that it will be required to settle by an outflow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Company, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposures arising on receipts and payments in foreign currencies relating to firm commitments.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reported balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The Company has not adopted the hedge accounting rules.
Consequently all gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the profit and loss account.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
120 overview business review governance financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Pensions The Company operates two funded defined benefit pension plans.
All other plans are defined contribution in nature where the amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension plans full actuarial valuations are carried out every three years using the projected unit credit method, and updates are performed at each balance sheet date.
The cost of providing benefits under these plans is determined separately for each plan, and attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost, and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of defined benefit obligations.
Past services are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis or immediately if the benefits have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benefits already accrued, or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs, the obligation and related plan assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the profit and loss account during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the defined benefit pension plan cost represents the change in present value of plan obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on plan assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received, and benefits paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on plan assets and the interest cost is recognised in the profit and loss account as finance costs or finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets, experience adjustments on liabilities and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The defined benefit pension plan asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each plan of the present value of the defined benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds denominated in the same currency and whose term is consistent with the estimated term of the obligation.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Company expects to recover, by way of reductions in the future contributions or refunds from the plan that have been agreed by the trustees.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc Ordinary Shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such Ordinary Shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Employee benefits When an employee has rendered service to the Company during an accounting period, short term benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service are recognised in the same accounting period.
Dividends paid The interim dividend is included in the financial statements in the period in which it is paid, and the final dividend in the period it is approved by the shareholders at an annual general meeting.

Significant accounting policies continued Sharebased payment The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using the HullWhite Trinomial model.
The cost of equitysettled transactions is recognised as a cost to the Company or as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work, over the vesting period of the equitysettled transactions with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
Any payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these sharebased payments result in a reduction in the cost of investment.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equitysettled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equitysettled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share trust for the granting of certain share incentives to employees.
Shares are held by the employee share trust, treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on the disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Employees Please refer to the Report on directors remuneration on pages 55 to 67 for disclosures relating to the emoluments, share incentives and long term incentive interests and pensions of the directors.

Pensions Defined benefit plans The funded defined benefit pension plans are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Spirent Communications plc Staff Pension & Life Assurance Plan Staff Plan and the Spirent Communications plc Retirement Cash & Life Assurance Plan Cash Plan.
The Staff Plan is the Companys most significant plan.
There is in addition an unfunded plan.
The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the plans as at 1 April 2009.
The present values of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and any past service costs were measured using the projected unit credit method.
i The key financial assumptions The assumptions used for both plans were as follows: 2012 2011 % % Inflation RPI 2.9 3.0 Inflation CPI 2.2 2.0 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 2.9 3.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment pre 2001 service 3.6 3.6 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2001 to 5 April 2005 service 2.8 2.9 Rate of increase for pensions post 5 April 2005 service 1.9 2.0 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.2 2.0 Rate used to discount plan liabilities 4.3 4.6 Expected rate of return on plan assets weighted for both plans 5.0 5.5 Spirent Communications plc employs a building block approach in determining the long term rate of return on plans assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long term rate of return on each class of asset is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return of each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the plans.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are such that a member currently aged 65 2011 aged 65 will live on average for a further 23.3 years 2011 21.9 years if they are male and for a further 25.5 years 2011 23.8 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2032 2011 in 2021 at age 65 2011 age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 24.2 years 2011 22.9 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26.6 years 2011 24.7 years after retirement if they are female.
The approximate impact to the past service liabilities of changing these main assumptions is as follows: Reducing the discount rate by 0.1 per cent per annum would increase past service liabilities by 2.5 million.
Increasing the RPI inflation assumption by 0.1 per cent would increase the plans liabilities by 0.8 million.
Increasing the life expectancy of a member by one year by modifying the standard mortality tables using an appropriate scaling factor would increase past service liabilities by 6.4 million.
There will also be an impact on the future service cost but given the small active population in these plans this is likely to be insignificant.

As a result only 0.3 million of the surplus in the Cash Plan was recognised at 31 December 2011.
The plans are prohibited from investing in Spirents own financial instruments.
For the purposes of the following disclosures the two plans have been combined as the Cash Plan is immaterial to these financial statements.

The above plans are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs HMRC taxexempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the HMRC statutory earnings cap, had their benefits increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benefits itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 of 0.5 million 2011 0.4 million.
This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a market value basis in line with the main plan valuation and adjusted each year.
There were no experience gains or losses on the unfunded plan in the period from 2008 to 2012.

Description of employee share plans Discretionary Plans 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP The EIP, which was approved by shareholders and introduced in 2005, is available for selected employees, including executive directors, on a discretionary basis.
Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, sharesettled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS.
For Performance share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions related to Total Shareholder Return TSR.
For awards made since 2011, performance conditions relate to the Companys EPS and TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 55 to 67.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP is now closed for new awards and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and sharesettled SARs.
No price was payable on the grant of an award.

Capital and reserves continued Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of SSIP awards made to Bill Burns prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
All outstanding awards have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the seventh anniversary of their respective grant dates.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
All Employee Plans UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP The UK ESPP, which is an HMRC approved share incentive plan, was approved by shareholders in 2005 and is available to all UK employees.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary Shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP operates in conjunction with a trust, which holds the shares on behalf of participants.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making invitations to all UK employees to acquire partnership shares on market using deductions from payroll.
2005 Sharesave Scheme The 2005 Sharesave Scheme was approved by shareholders in 2005 and was introduced following the expiry of the Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The scheme is an HMRC approved SaveAsYouEarn scheme open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
No invitations have yet been made under this scheme.

Sharebased payment The total charge for the year relating to employee sharebased payment plans is as follows: 2012 2011 million million 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.6 0.3 All schemes are equitysettled.
For 2012 the fair value of share incentives has been estimated as at the date of grant using the HullWhite trinomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the sharebased payment charge and the fair value: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price pence 153.1 143.2 Weighted average exercise price pence 7.6 1.9 Weighted average fair value pence 92.6 133.7 Expected volatility % 35.0 36.5 Option life years Performance shares 3 3 Options and SARs 10 10 Suboptimal exercise factor 1.5 Risk free rate % 2.4 2.03.6 Dividend yield % 1.6 2.0 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The risk free rate is calculated by reference to UK government bonds.
