MCEV notES to thE MCEV baSiS SupplEMEntary inforMation For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: MCEV policies a1: basis of preparation The Market Consistent Embedded Value methodology referred to herein and in the supplementary statements on pages 224 to 248 as MCEV adopts the Market Consistent Embedded Value Principles Copyright Stichting CFO Forum Foundation 2008 issued in June 2008 and updated in October 2009 by the CFO Forum the Principles as the basis for the methodology used in preparing the supplementary information.
The CFO Forum announced changes to the MCEV Principles in October 2009 to reflect inter alia the inclusion of a liquidity premium.
These changes affirm that the risk free reference rate to be applied under MCEV should include both the swap yield curve appropriate to the currency of the cash flows and a liquidity premium where appropriate.
The Principles have been materially complied with for all businesses at 31 December 2012.
The detailed methodology and assumptions made in presenting this supplementary information are set out in notes A2 and A3.
Throughout the supplementary information the following terminology is used to distinguish between the terms MCEV, Group MCEV and adjusted Group MCEV: MCEV is a measure of the consolidated value of shareholders interests in the covered business and consists of the sum of the shareholders adjusted net worth in respect of the covered business and the value of the in-force covered business Group MCEV is a measure of the consolidated value of shareholders interests in covered and non-covered business.
Non-covered business is valued at the IFRS net asset value detailed in the primary financial statements, adjusted to eliminate inter-company loans Adjusted Group MCEV, a measure used by management to assess the shareholders interest in the value of the Group, includes the impact of marking all debt to market value, the market value of the Groups listed banking subsidiary, marking the value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment arrangements in South Africa the BEE schemes to market, as well as including the market value of excess own shares held in ESOP schemes.
a2: Methodology a Introduction MCEV represents the present value of shareholders interests in the earnings distributable from assets allocated to the in-force covered business after sufficient allowance for the aggregate risks in the covered business, and is measured in a way that is consistent with the value that would normally be placed on the cash flows generated by these assets and liabilities in a deep and liquid market.
MCEV is therefore a risk-adjusted measure to the extent that financial risk is reflected through the use of market consistent techniques in the valuation of both assets and distributable earnings and a transparent explicit allowance is made for non-financial risks.
MCEV consists of the sum of the following components: Adjusted net worth, which excludes acquired intangibles and goodwill, consisting of: free surplus allocated to the covered business: and required capital to support the covered business.
Value of in-force covered business VIF.
The adjusted net worth is the market value of shareholders assets held in respect of the covered business after allowance for the liabilities which are dictated by local regulatory reserving requirements.
MCEV is calculated net of non-controlling shareholder interests and excludes the value of future new business.
b Coverage Covered business includes, where material, any contracts that are regarded by local insurance supervisors as long-term life assurance business, and other business, where material, directly related to such long-term life assurance business where the profits are included in the IFRS long-term business profits in the primary financial statements.
For the life businesses in Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, and where the covered business is not material, the treatment within this supplementary information is the same as in the primary financial statements, ie expected future profit for this business is not capitalised for MCEV reporting purposes.
For December 2011 comparatives, the covered business does not include any business written in Skandia Liv, a mutual life insurance company then part of the Group.
Some types of business are legally written by a life company, but under IFRS are classified as asset management because long-term business only serves as a wrapper.
This business continues to be excluded from covered business, for example: New institutional investment platform pensions business written in the United Kingdom, as it is more appropriately classified as unit trust business: and Individual unit trusts and some Group market-linked business written by the asset management companies in South Africa through the life company, as profits from this business arise in the asset management and asset administration companies.
228 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than the covered business is the same as in the primary financial statements.
The adjusted Group MCEV includes the impact of marking all debt to market value, the market value of the Groups listed banking subsidiary, marking the value of deferred consideration due in respect of Black Economic Empowerment arrangements in South Africa the BEE schemes to market, as well as including the market value of excess own shares held in ESOP schemes.
c Free surplus Free surplus is the market value of any assets allocated to, but not required to support, the in-force covered business.
It is determined as the market value of any excess assets attributed to the covered business but not backing the regulatory liabilities, less the required capital to support the covered business.
d Required capital Required capital is the market value of assets that is attributed to support the covered business, over and above that required to back statutory liabilities for covered business, whose distribution to shareholders is restricted.
The following capital measures are considered in determining the required capital held for covered business so that it reflects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business: Economic capital Regulatory capital, ie the level of solvency capital which the local regulators require Capital required by rating agencies in order to maintain the desired credit rating: and Any other required capital definition to meet internal management objectives.
Economic capital for the covered business is based upon Old Mutuals own internal assessment of risks inherent in the underlying business.
It measures capital requirements on a basis consistent with a 99.93% confidence level over a one-year time horizon.
For Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth, capital determined with reference to internal management objectives is the most onerous and is he capital measure used, whilst for Nordic the regulatory capital requirement was the most onerous in 31 December 2011 comparatives.
For Old Mutual Bermuda the required capital is equal to regulatory capital, which is a change from December 2011, where internal capital ie the adjusted net worth was used.
The required capital in respect of OMLAC SA s covered business is partially covered by the market value of the Groups investments in banking and general insurance in South Africa.
On consolidation these investments are shown separately.
The table below shows the level of required capital expressed as a percentage of the minimum local regulatory capital requirements.

In such cases the required capital reported for MCEV is net of these items, although each of the countries continues to be sufficiently capitalised on the local solvency basis.
Skandia Leben in Germany is permitted under local regulations to include the unallocated policyholder profit-sharing liability as admissible capital.
2 During December 2011, the BMA insurance Prudential Standards Class E Solvency Requirements Rules 2011 were formally signed into Bermudan law.
The regulations allow for a transition period for the new capital requirement 50% for financial year 2011.
The required capital calculated on this statutory basis was approximately 77 million at 31 December 2011.
In July 2012 it was agreed with the BMA that Old Mutual Bermuda business should hold capital resources of 433 million, comparable to those expected to be required under Solvency II, as calculated by the Groups existing internal capital model.
The capital requirement is held at a fixed amount between statutory filing dates and the July 2012 requirement has therefore been kept constant for 31 December 2012.
229 MCEV NotEs to thE MCEV basis supplEMENtary iNforMatioN For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: MCEV policies continued a2: Methodology continued e Value of in-force covered business Under the MCEV methodology, VIF consists of the following components: Present value of future profits PVFP from in-force covered business: less Time value of financial options and guarantees: less Frictional costs of required capital: less Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks CNHR.
Projected liabilities and cash flows are calculated net of outward risk reinsurance with allowance for default risk of reinsurance counterparties where material.
f Present value of future profits The PVFP is calculated as the discounted value of future distributable earnings taking account of local statutory reserving requirements that are expected to emerge from the in-force covered business, including the value of contractual renewal of in-force business, on a best estimate basis where assumed earned rates of return and discount rates are equal to the risk-free reference rates.
This is also known as a deterministic certainty equivalent valuation of future distributable earnings, and is described in more detail in note A3.
Any limitations on distribution of such earnings due to statutory or internal capital requirements are taken into account separately in the calculation of frictional costs of required capital.
PVFP captures the intrinsic and time value of financial options and guarantees on in-force covered business which are included in the local statutory reserves according to local requirements, but excludes any additional allowance for the time value of financial options and guarantees.
g Financial options and guarantees Allowance is made in the MCEV for the potential impact of variability of investment returns ie asymmetric impact, on future shareholder cash flows of policyholder financial options and guarantees within the in-force covered business.
The time value of financial options and guarantees describes that part of the value of financial options and guarantees that arises from the variability of future investment returns on assets to the extent that it is not already included in the statutory reserves.
The calculations are based on market consistent stochastic modeling techniques where the actual assets held at the valuation date are used as the starting point for the valuation of such financial options and guarantees.
Projected cash flows are valued using economic assumptions such that they are valued in line with the price of similar cash flows that are traded in the capital markets.
The time value represents the difference between the average value of shareholder cash flows under many generated economic scenarios and the deterministic shareholder value under the best estimate assumptions for the equivalent business.
Closed form solutions are also applied in Europe, provided the nature of any guarantees is not complex.
The time value of financial options and guarantees also includes allowance for potential burn-through costs on participating business, ie the extent to which shareholders are unable to recover a loan made to participating funds to meet either regulatory or internal capital management requirements or the extent to which reserves are inadequate to meet benefit payments during periods of severely adverse experience.
In the generated economic scenarios allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of dynamic management and or policyholder actions in different circumstances: Management has some discretion in managing exposure to financial options and guarantees, particularly within participating business.
Such dynamic management actions are reflected in the valuation of financial options and guarantees provided that such discretion is consistent with established and justifiable practice taking into account policyholders reasonable expectations eg with due consideration of the Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM, for South African business, subject to any contractual guarantees and regulatory or legal constraints, and has been passed through an appropriate approval process by the local Executive team and, where applicable, the Board.
Assumptions that depend on the market performance such as bonus rates are set relative to the risk free reference rates subject to contractual guarantees and assuming that all market participants are subjected to the same market conditions Where credible evidence exists that persistency rates are linked to economic scenarios, allowance is made for dynamic policyholder behaviour in response to changes in economic conditions Modeled dynamic management and policyholders actions include the following: changes in future bonus rates subject to contractual guarantees, including removing all or part of previously declared non-vested balances where circumstances warrant such action dynamic persistency rates for the Old Mutual Bermuda business, and dynamic guaranteed annuity option take-up rates for the South African business driven by changes in economic conditions and management actions: and changes in surrender values.
In determining the time value of financial options and guarantees, an appropriate number of simulations are run to ensure that a reasonable degree of convergence of results has been obtained.
230 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Europe Whilst certain products within the European businesses provide financial options and guarantees, these are immaterial due to the predominantly unit-linked nature of the business.
Emerging Markets The financial options and guarantees mainly relate to maturity guarantees and guaranteed annuity options.
As required by the applicable Actuarial Society of South Africa guidance note, the time value of the financial options and guarantees included in the statutory reserves in the Emerging Markets businesses at 31 December 2012 has been valued using a risk-neutral market consistent asset model, and is referred to as the Investment Guarantee Reserve IGR.
This reserve includes a discretionary margin as defined by local guidelines to allow for the sensitivity of the reserve to market movements, including interest rates, equity levels and the volatility implicit in the pricing of derivative instruments in these markets.
This discretionary margin is valued in the VIF.
Old Mutual Bermuda The financial options and guarantees mainly relate to the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits on variable annuity contracts.
h Frictional costs of required capital From the shareholders viewpoint there is a cost due to restrictions on the distribution of required capital that is locked in entities within the Group.
Where material, an allowance has been made for the frictional costs in respect of the taxation on investment return income and capital gains and investment costs on the assets backing the required capital for covered business.
The allowance for taxation is based on the taxation rates applicable to investment earnings on assets backing the required capital, although such tax rates are reduced, where applicable, to allow for interest paid on debt which is used partly to finance the required capital.
The run-off pattern of the required capital is projected on an approximate basis over the lifetime of the underlying risks in line with drivers of the capital requirement.
The same drivers are used to split the total required capital between existing business and new business.
The allowance for frictional costs is independent of the allowance for the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks as described below.
i Cost of residual non-hedgeable risks Sufficient allowance for most financial risks has been made in the PVFP and the time value of financial options and guarantees by using techniques that are similar to the type of approaches used by capital markets.
In addition the modeling of some non-hedgeable non-financial risks is incorporated as part of the calculation of the PVFP eg to the extent that expected operational losses are incorporated in the maintenance expense assumptions or the time value of financial options and guarantees eg dynamic policyholder behaviour such as the interaction of the investment scenario and the persistency rates.
Residual non-financial risks include, for example, liability risks such as mortality, longevity and morbidity risks: business risks such as persistency, expense and reinsurance credit risks: and operational risk.
For Old Mutual Bermuda, in addition to the allowance for residual non-hedgeable risks, CNHR includes an allowance for hedge ineffectiveness risk and credit spread risk, which are not modeled in the PVFP or TVOG calculations.
An allowance is made in the CNHR to reflect uncertainty in the best estimate of shareholder cash flows as a result of both symmetric and asymmetric non-hedgeable risks since these risks cannot be hedged in deep and liquid capital markets and are managed, inter alia, by holding risk capital.
Considering the Group as a whole, most residual non-hedgeable risks have a symmetric impact on shareholder value, ie commensurate upside and downside impacts, with the exception of operational risk.
The CNHR is calculated using a cost of capital approach, ie it is determined as the present value of capital charges for all future nonhedgeable risk capital requirements until the liabilities have run off.
The capital charge in each year is the product of the projected expected non-hedgeable risk capital held after allowance for some diversification benefits and the cost of capital charge.
The cost of capital charge therefore represents the return above the risk free reference rates that the market is deemed to demand for providing this capital.
The residual non-hedgeable risk capital measure is determined using an internal capital model based on appropriate shock scenarios consistent with a 99.5% confidence level over a one-year time horizon, using the same approach when calculating economic capital at a 99.93% confidence level.
The internal capital model makes allowance for certain management actions, such as reductions in bonus rates, where deemed appropriate.
The residual non-hedgeable risk capital makes an allowance for non-linearities between financial and non-hedgeable risks.
The following allowance is made for diversification benefits in determining the residual non-hedgeable risk capital at a business unit level: Diversification benefits within the non-hedgeable risks of the covered business are allowed for No allowance is made for diversification benefits between hedgeable and non-hedgeable risks of the covered business No allowance is made for diversification benefits between covered and non-covered business.
A cost of capital charge of 2.0% has been applied to residual symmetric and asymmetric non-hedgeable capital at a business unit level over the life of the contracts.
This rate is derived by considering a market-based view of required return on equity for the covered business, and then deducting risk-free investment returns, frictional costs and an allowance for franchise value.
This translates into an equivalent cost of capital rate of approximately 2.4% being applied to the Group diversified capital required in respect of such non-hedgeable risks.
231 MCEV NotEs to thE MCEV basis supplEMENtary iNforMatioN For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: MCEV policies continued a2: Methodology continued j Participating business For participating business in Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Bermuda, the method of valuation makes assumptions about future bonus rates and the determination of profit allocation between policyholders and shareholders.
These assumptions are made on a basis consistent with other projection assumptions, especially the projected future risk free investment returns, established Company practice with due consideration of the PPFM for South African business, past external communication, any pay-out smoothing strategy, local market practice, regulatory contractual restrictions and bonus participation rules.
Where current benefit levels are higher than can be supported by the existing fund assets together with projected investment returns, a downward glide path is projected in benefit levels so that the policyholder fund would be exhausted on payment of the last benefit.
k Valuation of assets and treatment of unrealised losses The market values of assets, where quoted in deep and liquid markets, are based on the bid price on the reporting date.
Unquoted assets are valued according to IFRS and marked to model.
No smoothing of market values or unrealised gains losses is applied.
l Asset mix The time value of financial options and guarantees and PVFP where relevant is calculated with reference to assets that are projected using the actual asset allocation of the policyholder funds at the reporting date.
However, if the current asset mix is materially different to the long-term strategic asset allocation as a result of market movements, projected assets are assumed to revert to the long-term strategic asset allocation in the shortto medium-term as appropriate.
m Consolidation adjustments The MCEV result split by business unit takes account of both sides of any loan arrangements between Group companies, with the Group effect included in net other business.
n Look through principle PVFP and value of new business cash flow projections look through and include the profits losses of owned service companies, eg distribution and administration, related to the management of the covered business.
Any profit margins that are included in investment management fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business on the grounds of materiality.
o Taxation In valuing shareholders cash flows, allowance is made in the cash flow projections for taxes in the relevant jurisdiction affecting the covered business.
Tax assumptions are based on best estimate assumptions, applying current local corporate tax legislation and practice together with known future changes and taking credit for any deferred tax assets.
The value of deferred tax assets is partly recognised in the MCEV.
Typically those tax assets are expected to be utilised in future by being offset against expected tax liabilities that are generated on expected profits emerging from in-force business.
MCEV may therefore understate the true economic value of such deferred tax assets because it does not allow for future new business sales which could affect the utilisation of such assets.
United Kingdom The Emergency Budget that was held in June 2010 stated that the UKs mainstream corporation tax rate would be reduced from its current level of 28% down to 24% in annual 1% steps.
Following that, there were further announcements for additional reductions down to 22%, and accelerations of these reductions.
The reduction to 25%, effective from April 2012, has been allowed for in the December 2011 results.
The December 2012 results allow for an additional 1% reduction to 24%, effective from April 2012 and the further 1% reduction to 23%, effective from April 2013.
This additional 2% reduction amounts to 8 million in the December 2012 results.
The impact of the remaining reduction from 23% down to 21%, applicable from April 2014, is expected to be 7 million.
South Africa A new dividend withholding tax system replacing the current Secondary Tax on Companies STC system was introduced in South Africa effective from 1 April 2012.
This was reflected in the results at 31 December 2011, ie no allowance was made for future dividend withholding tax in the MCEV, with the exception of dividend withholding tax on the remittance of dividends to Old Mutual plc, as the actual level of taxation would depend on the legal status of each shareholder.
Allowance has now been made for dividend withholding tax on dividends earned in the policyholder funds as well as allowing for the increase in capital gains tax in policyholder funds.
The average effective tax rate remains unchanged at 28%.

Further information relating to the debt securities can be found in Note E1 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
q New business and renewals The market consistent value of new business VNB measures the value of the future profits expected to emerge from all new business sold, and in some cases from premium increases to existing contracts, during the reporting period after allowance for the time value of financial options and guarantees, frictional costs and the cost of residual non-hedgeable risks associated with writing the new business.
VNB includes contractual renewal of premiums and recurring single premiums, where the level of premium is predefined and is reasonably predictable, and changes to existing contracts where there are not variations allowed for in the PVFP.
Non-contractual increments are treated similarly where the volume of such increments is reasonably predictable or likely eg where premiums are expected to increase in line with salary or price inflation.
Any variations in premiums on renewal of in-force business from that previously anticipated, including deviations in non-contractual increases, deviations in recurrent single premiums and repricing of premiums for in-force business, are treated as experience variances or economic variances on in-force business and not as new business.
VNB is calculated as follows: Economic assumptions at the start of the reporting period are used, except for OMLAC SA s non-profit annuities products where point of sale assumptions are used Demographic and operating assumptions at the end of the reporting period are used At point of sale and rolled forward to the end of the reporting period Generally using a stand-alone approach unless a marginal approach would better reflect the additional value to shareholders created through the activity of writing new business Expense allowances include all acquisition expenses, including any acquisition expense overruns.
Strategic business development expenses are excluded Net of tax, reinsurance and non-controlling interests No attribution of any investment and operating variances to VNB New business margins are disclosed as: The ratio of VNB to the present value of new business premiums PVNBP : and The ratio of VNB to annual premium equivalent APE, where APE is calculated as annualised recurring premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
PVNBP is calculated at point of sale using premiums before reinsurance and applying a valuation approach that is consistent with the calculation of VNB.
r Analysis of MCEV earnings An analysis of MCEV earnings provides a reconciliation of the MCEV for covered business at the beginning of the reporting period and the MCEV for covered business at the end of the reporting period on a net of taxation basis.
Operating MCEV earnings are generated by the value of new business sold during the reporting period, the expected existing business contribution, operating experience variances, operating assumption changes and other operating variances: The value of new business includes the impact of new business strain on free surplus that arises, amongst other things, from the impact of initial expenses and additional required capital that is held in respect of such new business The expected existing business contribution is determined by projecting both actual assets and actual liabilities including assets backing the free surplus and required capital from the start of the reporting period to the end of the reporting period using expected real-world earned rates of return.
The expected existing business contribution is presented in two components: Expected earnings on free surplus and required capital and the expected change in VIF assuming that the assets earn the beginning of period risk free reference rates as well as the deterministic release of the time value of options and guarantees, frictional costs and CNHR: and Additional expected earnings on free surplus and required capital and the additional expected change in VIF as a result of real-world expected earned rates of return on assets in excess of beginning of period risk free reference rates Transfers from VIF and required capital to free surplus include the release of required capital and modeled profits from VIF into free surplus in respect of business that was in-force at the beginning of the reporting period, although the movement does not contribute to a change in the MCEV 233 MCEV NotEs to thE MCEV basis supplEMENtary iNforMatioN For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: MCEV policies continued a2: Methodology continued r Analysis of MCEV earnings continued Operating experience variances reflect the impact of deviations of the actual operational experience during the reporting period from the expected operational experience.
It is analysed before operating assumption changes, ie such variances are assessed against opening operating assumptions, and reflects the total impact of in-force and new business variances Operating assumption changes incorporate the impact of changes to operating assumptions from those assumed at the beginning of the reporting period to those assumed at the end of the reporting period.
As VNB is calculated using operating assumptions at the end of the reporting period, this impact only relates to the value of in-force business at the end of the reporting period that was also in-force at the beginning of the reporting period Other operating variances include model improvements, changes in methodology and the impact of certain management actions, such as a change in the asset allocation backing required capital Total MCEV earnings also include economic variances and other non-operating variances: Economic variances incorporate the impact of changes in economic assumptions from the beginning of the reporting period to the end of the reporting period eg different opening and closing interest rates and equity volatility, increases in equity market values during the period as well as the impact on earnings resulting from actual returns on assets being different to the expected returns on those assets as reflected in the expected existing business contribution.
It therefore also includes the impact of economic variances in the reporting period on projected future earnings Other non-operating variances include the impact of changes in mandatory local regulations and legislative changes in taxation.
An analysis of MCEV earnings requires non-operating closing adjustments in respect of exchange rate movements and capital transfers such as those in respect of payment of dividends and acquiring divesting businesses.
Return on MCEV for covered business is calculated as the operating MCEV earnings after tax divided by opening MCEV in local currency, except for Old Mutual Wealth, core covered business and total covered business where the calculations are performed in sterling.
The anticipated expected existing business contribution for the 12 months following the year ended 31 December 2012 at the reference rate as well as in excess of the reference rate is provided to assist users of the MCEV supplementary information in forecasting operating MCEV earnings.
Note that for comparability against current year earnings, the average exchange rates over 2012 are used.
Therefore the expected existing business contribution for the financial year ending 31 December 2013 ultimately reflected in the 2013 financial statements may differ from these results.
s Group MCEV presentation Presentation of Group MCEV consists of the covered business under the MCEV methodology and the non-covered business valued as the unadjusted IFRS net asset value, with the exception of US Asset Management that is valued at IFRS NAV, allowing for the value of the loan note held with Old Mutual plc.
A mark to market adjustment is not performed for external borrowings and other items not on a mark to market basis under IFRS relating to non-covered business.
a3: assumptions Non-economic assumptions The appropriate non-economic projection assumptions for future experience eg mortality, persistency and expenses, are determined using best estimate assumptions of each component of future cash flows, are specific to the entity concerned and have regard to past, current and expected future experience where sufficient evidence exists eg longevity improvements and AIDS-related claims, as derived from both entity-specific and industry data where deemed appropriate.
Material assumptions are actively reviewed by means of detailed experience investigations and updated, as deemed appropriate, at least annually.
These assumptions are based on the covered business being part of a going concern, although favourable changes in maintenance expenses such as productivity improvements are generally not included beyond what has been achieved by the end of the reporting period, apart from certain development expenses described below.
Expense assumptions for run-off businesses consider cost reductions in future in line with management actions that would be taken as in-force volumes decrease.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, maintenance of in-force business including investment management expenses and development projects.
All expected maintenance expense overruns affecting the covered business are allowed for in the calculations MCEV makes provision for future development costs and one-off expenses relating to covered business that are known with sufficient certainty, based on three-year business plans.
The provision is reduced to the extent that projects have associated benefits that are directly quantifiable and are considered to emerge within a reasonable timeframe eg over the business plan period Unallocated Group holding company expenses have been included to the extent that they are allocated to the covered business.
The table below shows the future expenses attributable to the long-term business.
The allocation of these expenses is based on the proportion that the management expenses incurred by the covered businesses bears to the total management expenses incurred by the Group.
234 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business In line with legislation in Germany, a specified proportion of miscellaneous profits is shared with policyholders.
The revenue on in-force business can be reduced by various expense items incurred in any year.
As such, in the 31 December 2011 VIF calculation, Skandia Leben Germany made allowance for the acquisition expenses in relation to the new business written over the next three years when setting the best estimate assumptions for the profit to be shared with policyholders in future years.
As the business has been placed in run-off during 2012, acquisition expenses have not been incorporated into profit-sharing assumptions at 31 December 2012.

Economic assumptions An active basis is applied to set pre-tax investment and economic assumptions to reflect the economic conditions prevailing on the reporting date.
Economic assumptions are set consistently, for example future bonus rates are set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Under a market consistent valuation, economic assumptions are determined such that projected cash flows are valued in line with the prices of similar cash flows that are traded on the capital markets.
Thus, risk-free cash flows are discounted at a risk-free reference rate and equity cash flows at an equity rate.
In practice for the PVFP, where cash flows do not depend on or vary linearly with market movements, a certainty equivalent method is used which assumes that actual assets held earn, before tax and investment management expenses, risk-free reference rates including any liquidity adjustment and all the cash flows are discounted using risk-free reference rates including any liquidity adjustment which are gross of tax and investment management expenses.
The deterministic certainty equivalent method is purely a valuation technique and over time the expectation is still that risk premiums will be earned on assets such as equities and corporate bonds.
a Risk-free reference rates and inflation The risk-free reference rates, reinvestment rates and discount rates are determined with reference to the swap yield curve appropriate to the currency of the cash flows.
For Europe the swap yield curve is obtained from Bloomberg.
For Old Mutual Bermuda the swap yield curve is sourced from a third-party market consistent asset model that is used to generate the economic scenarios that are required to value the time value of financial options and guarantees.
For Emerging Markets the swap yield curve is sourced internally using market data provided by the Bond Exchange of South Africa and it is checked for reasonability relative to the Bloomberg swap yield curve.
At 31 December 2012, no adjustments are made to swap yields to allow for liquidity premiums or credit risk premiums, apart from a liquidity premium adjustment to OMLAC SA s immediate annuity business and fixed bond businesses.
A liquidity premium adjustment is applied to OMLAC SA s fixed bond business as OMLAC SA holds a portfolio of non-government bonds which have a market yield in excess of the risk-free rate and the duration of the asset portfolio and the liability duration are a good match meaning the asset portfolio is held to maturity.
Cash flows on this product are also predictable and the company has adequate liquidity to withstand a substantial increase in lapses at all durations without having to sell bonds which further strengthens the case for applying a liquidity premium.
It is the directors view that a proportion of non-government bond spreads at 31 December 2012 is attributable to a liquidity premium rather than only to credit and default allowances and that returns in excess of swap rates can be achieved, rather than entire spreads being lost to worsening default experience.
For OMLAC SA s immediate annuity business the currency, credit quality and duration of the actual bond portfolios were considered and adjusted risk-free reference rates were derived at 31 December 2012 by adding 50bps of liquidity premium for this business 2011: 50bps to the swap rates used for setting investment return and discounting assumptions.
For OMLAC SA s fixed bond products 45bps of liquidity premium was added to the swap rates 2011: 50bps.
These adjustments reflect the liquidity premium component in non-government bond spreads over swap rates that is expected to be earned on the portfolios.
In deriving the liquidity premiums at 31 December 2012, we compared the yields of similar durations on South African government bonds and bonds issued by state-owned enterprises.
At those durations where swap yields are not available, eg due to lack of a sufficiently liquid or deep swap market, the swap curve is extended using appropriate interpolation or extrapolation techniques.
The risk-free reference spot yields excluding any applicable liquidity adjustments at various terms for each of the significant regions are provided in the table below.
The risk-free reference spot yield curve has been derived from mid-swap rates at the reporting date.
Expense inflation rates have been derived by comparing real rates of return against nominal risk-free rates for each territory, with adjustments for higher business unit specific inflation where applicable.

These models project the assets and liabilities using a distribution of asset returns where all asset types, on average, earn the same risk-free reference rates.
Apart from the risk-free reference yields specified above, other key economic assumptions for the calibration of economic scenarios include the implied volatilities for each asset class and correlations of investment returns between different asset classes.
For Old Mutual Bermuda, implied volatilities and correlations are determined for each global equity and bond index modeled.
The volatility assumptions for the calibration of economic scenarios that are used in the stochastic models are, where possible, based on those implied from appropriate derivative prices such as equity options or swaptions in respect of guarantees that are dependent on changes in equity markets and interest rates respectively as observed on the valuation date.
However, historic implied and historic observed volatilities of the underlying instruments and expert opinion are considered where there are concerns over the depth or liquidity of the market.
Where strict adherence to the above is not possible, for example where markets only exist at short durations such as the swaption market in South Africa, interpolation or extrapolation techniques, and where appropriate, historical data are used to derive volatility assumptions for the full Term structure of the liabilities.
Correlation assumptions between asset classes that are used in stochastic models are based on an assessment of historic relationships.
Where historic data is used in setting volatility or correlation assumptions, a suitable time period is considered for analysing historic data including consideration of the appropriateness of historical data where economic conditions were materially different to current conditions.
c Exchange rates All MCEV figures are calculated in local currency and translated to pounds using the appropriate exchange rates as detailed in Note A1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
d Expected asset returns in excess of the risk-free reference rates The expected asset returns in excess of the risk free reference rates have no bearing on the calculated MCEV other than the calculation of the expected existing business contribution in the analysis of MCEV earnings.
Real-world economic assumptions are determined with reference to one-year forward risk-free reference rates applicable to the currency of the liabilities at the start of the reporting period.
All other economic assumptions, for example future bonus rates, are set at levels consistent with the real-world investment return assumptions.
Equity and property risk premiums incorporate both historical relationships and the directors view of future projected returns in each region over the analysis period.
Pre-tax real-world economic assumptions are determined as follows: The equity risk premium is 3.7% for Africa 2011: 3.5% and 3% for Europe The cash return equals the one year risk free reference rate for all regions The property risk premium is 1.5% in Africa and 2% in Europe Returns on corporate bonds reference actual yields from assets held No risk premium is assumed for Old Mutual Bermudas variable annuity policyholder asset portfolios.

Non-core covered business Old Mutual Bermuda Very favourable persistency experience on the Old Mutual Bermuda variable annuity book of business, leading to positive assumption changes Capital has been transferred to Old Mutual Bermuda to meet the enhanced capital requirements of the Bermuda Monetary Authority BMA The expiration of the five-year guarantees, higher than expected lapses, lapse assumption changes and favourable market performance has led to a significant reduction in variable annuity guarantee reserves.
new business Emerging Markets: VNB increased by 36% due to higher volumes and margins mix of business, repricing of certain products and favourable assumption changes, partially offset by the rand depreciation over 2012.
There have been strong recurring premium sales in Mass Foundation Cluster and single premium annuity sales in Corporate segment.
However, covered single premium savings sales in Retail Affluent and Corporate segment have lagged in 2012 although non-covered single premium savings sales have improved significantly.
Old Mutual Wealth: Following the cessation of significant parts of uneconomic product lines as a result of business restructuring initiatives, there have been lower covered sales in the UK.
International sales were affected by regulatory changes that were overcome in the fourth quarter of 2012. transfers from the value of in-force business Old Mutual Wealth: Lower expected transfers in 2012 are mainly as a result of the run-off of closed books and the sale of the Finnish business.
Non-core covered Old Mutual Bermuda : The large negative expected transfer in 2012 is a result of the anticipated loss in fee income from the significant number of variable annuity surrenders post the five-year guarantee top-up point and the anticipated amortisation of deferred acquisition costs resulting from the business run-off.
Experience variances and operating assumption changes Emerging Markets: Positive risk experience from Retail Affluent and Mass Foundation Cluster products continued in 2012, with positive assumption changes of 49 million reflecting some of this experience.
Other experience losses mainly relate to higher than anticipated taxation in 2012.
Experience variances also include an investment of 18 million in the development of our franchise in African countries and Mexico, as well as the development cost of new strategic capabilities, and also expenses of a one-off nature including IT project expenditure of 28 million.
Old Mutual Wealth: The positive persistency experience is mainly a result of a lower than anticipated number of surrenders in the UK Legacy savings business in the run-up to the Retail Distribution Review RDR.
Negative persistency assumption changes relate mainly to a reduction in anticipated lapses on protection products at later durations of 11 million and the anticipated increase in surrenders of products in Germany and Austria of 7 million, consistent with recent experience.
Expense losses include one-off restructuring costs of 16 million as well as investments of 19 million in development initiatives in Platform and International businesses.
Non-core covered Old Mutual Bermuda : Positive persistency profits reflect better than expected 5-year anniversary surrender experience on variable annuity products.
Non-Hong Kong Universal Guarantee Option UGO business experienced a 79% surrender rate and the Hong Kong UGO business experienced a 63% lapse rate since these businesses entered the top-up period.
In light of this experience, surrender assumptions have been increased for policies that are yet to reach their five-year anniversary 20 million impact.
Positive expense assumption changes of 19 million reflect reduced aggregate expenses needed to meet the remaining obligations of the business.
Other assumption changes of 10 million are mainly driven by a reduction in rebate income as underlying client portfolios reach sub-scale levels.
Discontinued Nordic : Experience variances reflect accrued IFRS profits during the year prior to the sale of the business.
242 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business other operating variances Emerging Markets: Other operating variances mainly reflect the impact of a management decision to utilise the future profit stream arising from unclaimed benefits to fund an advisor training academy, and to enhance the surrender values on old generation reversionary bonus policies.
Old Mutual Wealth: Other operating variances include the 73 million impact of the management action to place the German and Austrian businesses into run-off.
Setting expense assumptions on a run-off basis for these businesses reduced MCEV by 26 million and a change in profit-sharing assumptions for the German PHP business reduced MCEV by 47 million.
Variances also include the release of development provisions of 17 million change in methodology to recognise project benefits as well as costs where benefits are directly quantifiable and emerge within a reasonable timeframe and CNHR modeling changes.
Economic variances Emerging Markets: Significant positive economic variances have emerged from better than expected investment returns favourable equity, bond and credit market performance, together with the reduction in the swap yield curve, which has increased the VIF.
Old Mutual Wealth: Significantly positive economic variances have emerged from better than expected policyholder fund performance over 2012 due to better than expected equity and bond market returns.
Non-core covered Old Mutual Bermuda : The positive variance resulting in significantly lower variable annuity guarantee reserves is mainly due to positive equity market performance, and reduced volatilities, partially offset by lower shortto medium-term interest rates.
other non-operating variances Emerging Markets: Other non-operating variances consist mainly of modeling changes to incorporate the new South African dividend withholding tax regime, and higher capital gains tax, in the calculation of policyholder investment returns in MCEV models.
Closing adjustments Emerging Markets: Capital and dividend flows include the net impact of dividends paid of 130 million, the purchase of Africa operations from Old Mutual plc of 92 million, the transfer of net asset value of the Zimbabwe and Namibian holding companies from non-covered business of 135 million and the Zimbabwe indigenisation costs of 34 million.
The negative foreign exchange variance reflects the 10% depreciation of the rand over the period pounds ZAR exchange rate increased from 12.56 at 31 December 2011 to 13.77 at 31 December 2012.
Old Mutual Wealth: Closing adjustments include the impact of the sale of the Finnish business 25 million.
Non-core covered Old Mutual Bermuda : The positive capital and dividend flows of 360 million include 352 million relating to the transfer of capital to this business in the form of additional Old Mutual plc loan notes and other assets to enable it to meet the new enhanced capital requirements of the Bermuda Monetary Authority BMA.
