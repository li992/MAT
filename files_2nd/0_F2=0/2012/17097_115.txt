Expected volatility reflects the assumption that historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The risk-free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which, in most cases, is the historic dividend yield.
No other features relating to the granting of options were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
At 1 March 2012 there were outstanding options for employees to purchase up to 1.2m 2011: 1.3m ordinary shares of 76.80 pence each between 2011 and 2016 at prices between 7.28 and 14.17 per share 2011: between 2011 and 2016 at prices between 5.39 and 14.17 per share.

32 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a contracted-in defined contribution scheme under the Whitbread Group Pension Fund.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
The Group also has a contracted-out defined contribution pension scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 3.6m 2010 11: 3.3m.
At the year end, 1,812 employees 2011: 1,743 were active members of the schemes, which also had 6,777 deferred members 2011: 6,791.
Defined benefit schemes The defined benefit final salary section of the principal Group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001 and to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
The scheme is funded, and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
86 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued At the year end the scheme had no active members 2011: nil, 25,500 deferred pensioners 2011: 26,101 and 16,511 pensions in payment 2011: 16,258.
A scheme specific actuarial valuation for the purpose of determining the level of cash contributions to be paid into the Whitbread Group Pension Fund was undertaken as at 31 March 2008.
A deficit recovery plan and some protection whilst the scheme remains in deficit have been agreed with the Trustee.
The Group made a 85m payment in 2011 12, which included an accelerated payment of 25m, and will make the following payments to the Fund: 30m in August 2012 and 55m in August 2013: 65m in each of August 2014 and August 2015: 70m in August 2016: 80m in each of August 2017 and August 2018.
For the period of the deficit, the Group has agreed to give undertakings to the Trustee similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to the value of any outstanding recovery plan payments or the remaining deficit, if lower.
Until the next valuation, the Trustee has also been given a promise of participation in increases in ordinary dividends where these exceed RPI and the right to consultation before any special distribution can be made.
In addition to the scheduled deficit contribution payments described above, the Pension Scheme will receive a share of the income, profits and a variable capital payment from its investment in Moorgate Scottish Limited Partnership, which was established by the Group in the year ended 4 March 2010 the share in profits is accounted for by the Group as contributions when paid.
The partnership interests in Moorgate SLP are held by the Group, the general partner, and by the Pension Scheme.
Moorgate SLP holds an investment in a further partnership, Farringdon Scottish Partnership, which was also established by the Group during 2009 10.
Property assets, with a market value of 221m, have been transferred from other Group companies to Farringdon SP and leased back to Whitbread Group PLC and Premier Inn Hotels Limited.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
However, the Trustee has first charge over the property portfolio and certain other assets with an aggregate value of 228m.
The Group retains control over both partnerships, and as such they are fully consolidated in these Group financial statements.
The Pension Scheme is a partner in Moorgate SLP and, as such, is entitled to an annual share of the profits of the partnership over the next 13 years.
At the end of this period, the partnership capital allocated to the Pension Scheme partner will be transferred in cash to the Pension Scheme up to a value of 150m 2011: 150m, depending on the funding position of the Pension Scheme at that time.
Under IAS 19 the investment held by the Pension Scheme in Moorgate SLP, a consolidated entity, does not represent a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, the pension deficit position in these Group financial statements does not reflect the 141m 2011: 141m investment in Moorgate SLP held by the Pension Scheme.
The total service cost contributions to the Whitbread Group Pension Fund in 2012 13 will be nil.
The IAS 19 pension cost, relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Lane Clark & Peacock and Towers Watson, using the projected unit credit method.
As the scheme is now closed to future accrual, there will be no service cost in the future.
co. uk At 1 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Retirement benefits continued Defined benefit schemes continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuation carried out as at 31 March 2008 of the UK schemes to 1 March 2012 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 1 March 3 March 2012 2011 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00% 3.25% Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.20% 2.15% Pension increases in deferment 3.00% 3.45% Discount rate 4.65% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.15% 3.45% 1.
The Whitbread Group Pension Fund was closed to future accrual on 31 December 2009.
From this point active members' benefits only increase in line with inflation.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.8 years 2011: 20.7 if they are male and for a further 23.3 years 2011: 23.2 if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2031 at age 65, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 22.6 years 2011: 22.6 after retirement if they are male and for a further 25.1 years 2011: 25.0 after retirement if they are female.
The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each actual asset allocation for the Fund at 1 March 2012 rounded to the nearest 0.1% per annum.
The weighted average of the expected rates of return on the asset base is assumed to be 2.45% 2011: 3.25% per annum aboveinflation.

The asset performance was worse than expected over the period which has led to a modest loss.
However, the principal reason for the increase is the reduction in the discount rate.
