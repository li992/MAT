Financial instruments excludes the Investment Property.
The tables below analyse financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly prices or indirectly derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Private equity included under level 3 is valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines issued in September 2009.
Unlisted investments in private equity are stated at the General Partners valuation.
The General Partners policy in valuing unlisted investments is to carry them at fair value.
The General Partner will generally rely on the fund investment managers fair value at the last reported period rolled forward for any cash flows.
However if the General Partner does not feel the manager is reflecting a fair value they will select a valuation methodology that is most appropriate for the particular investments in that fund and generate a fair value.
In those circumstances the General Partner believes the most appropriate methodologies to use to value the underlying investments in the portfolio are: t 1SJDF PG B SFDFOU JOWFTUNFOU t.
