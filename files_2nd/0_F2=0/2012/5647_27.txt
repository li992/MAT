Enabling Everywhere | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements 93 Derivative assets Credit risk with respect to derivatives is controlled by limiting transactions to major banking counterparties where internationally agreed standard form documentation exists.
The credit ratings of these counterparties are monitored.
Cash and cash equivalents Credit risk relating to cash and cash equivalents is monitored daily, on a counterparty by counterparty basis.
The credit limits imposed specify the maximum amount of cash which can be invested in, or with, any single counterparty.
These limits are determined by geographic presence, expertise and credit rating.
Filtrona monitors the credit ratings of counterparties.
The following credit risk table provides information regarding the credit risk exposure of Filtrona by classifying deferred consideration, derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents according to credit ratings of the counterparties.
AAA is the highest possible rating and all of the assets are neither impaired nor past due.

ii Market price risk Market price risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect income or the value of financial assets and liabilities.
Filtrona has produced a sensitivity analysis that shows the estimated change to the income statement and equity of a 1%, 5% or 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all other currencies or an increase or decrease of 50 basis points bps, 100bps and 200bps in market interest rates.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates and actual results in the future may materially differ.
Filtrona is exposed to two types of market price risk: currency risk and interest rate risk.
a Currency risk Filtrona publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but conducts business in several foreign currencies.
Therefore it is subject to currency risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the translation of results and underlying net assets of its operations and their transaction costs.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The majority of Filtronas net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Companys normal policy is to limit the translation exposure and the resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 31 December 2012, Filtronas euro denominated assets were 90% hedged by its euro denominated borrowings 2011: 92%, whilst its US dollar denominated assets were approximately 47% 2011: 59% hedged by the US dollar denominated borrowings.
Transaction exposure hedging The majority of Filtronas transactions are carried out in the functional currencies of its operations and so transaction exposure is limited.
However, where they do occur, Filtrona uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases over a period of up to 12 months.
Filtrona does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the Groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The Group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash ow hedges.
To the extent that cash ow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
94 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 Notes 1.
Risk management continued The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 1%, 5% and 10% weakening or strengthening in sterling against all currencies.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year all currencies average rates have been increased or decreased by 1%, 5% or 10%.
The translational effect on equity is limited as a proportion of US dollar and euro exposure is hedged.
Accordingly the effect on equity is calculated by increasing or decreasing the closing rate of all currencies with an adjustment for the movement in currency hedges.
It is assumed that all net investment and cash ow hedges will be 100% effective.

The following table shows Filtronas sensitivity to a 50bps, 100bps and 200bps decrease or increase in sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year the interest rates on all external oating rate interest bearing loans and borrowings have been increased or decreased by 50bps, 100bps or 200bps and the resulting increase or decrease in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.
The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 50bps, 100bps or 200bps decrease or increase in interest rates on the fair values of Filtronas interest rate derivatives.

Enabling Everywhere | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements 95 iii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Filtrona, although solvent, will encounter difficulties in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
In 2011 Filtrona signed an agreement with a syndicate of relationship banks to provide new banking facilities until August 2016.
This facility replaced its existing facilities which expired in April 2012.
Fees of 3.1m paid in respect of these facilities have been capitalised and are being expensed in the income statement over the expected life of the facilities in accordance with the effective interest method.
Filtronas objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility.
Filtrona is mostly funded by two series of US$80m US Private Placement Loan Notes from various financial institutions and syndicated five-year revolving credit facilities of 165.6m and 187.7m from its bankers.
The two series of Loan Notes of US$80m have maturities of seven and ten years and the revolving credit facilities mature in August 2016.
At 31 December 2012 the available bank and non-bank facilities totalled 416.4m 2011: 425.2m of which 207.4m 2011: 181.1m was drawn down.
In addition, uncommitted and overdraft facilities are maintained to provide short-term exibility.
Amounts drawn by Filtrona on its committed facilities are subject to standard banking covenants.
Filtronas available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December were: 2012 2011 m m Expiring after two years 209.0 244.1 Any loans drawn on these facilities would bear interest at oating rates with reference to LIBOR for the currency and period of the loan.
The maturity of Filtronas financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, is analysed below.
All trade and other payables are due to be settled in less than six months.

Risk management continued Total financial assets and liabilities The table below sets out Filtronas accounting categories and fair value for each class of financial asset and liability.
2012 2011 Total Total carrying carrying Fair Loans and Amortised and fair Fair Loans and Amortised and fair value receivables cost value value receivables cost value m m m m m m m m Trade and other receivables 90.2 90.2 79.3 79.3 Derivative assets 0.3 0.3 1.2 1.2 Cash and cash equivalents 41.4 41.4 35.8 35.8 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 204.9 204.9 180.7 180.7 Derivative liabilities 0.2 0.2 0.5 0.5 Trade and other payables 71.3 71.3 56.2 56.2 0.1 131.6 276.2 144.5 0.7 115.1 236.9 121.1 Total trade and other receivables carried at 94.5m 2011: 85.4m include prepayments and accrued income of 4.3m 2011: 6.1m which are not financial assets and are therefore excluded from the above analysis.
Fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps have been calculated at year end forward exchange rates compared to contracted rates.
Included within interest bearing loans and borrowings are $160m US Private Placement Loan Notes.
The Loan Notes are held at amortised cost with a carrying value of 97.1m 2011: 102.1m.
The Group estimates that the total fair value of the Loan Notes is 111.7m 2011: 117.6m.
All other financial assets, classied as loans and receivables, and trade and other payables, classied as amortised cost, are held at amortised cost and have short terms to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying amounts at the reporting date approximate the fair values.
Unsecured bank loans, included within interest bearing loans and borrowings, incur interest at oating rates and as a result their carrying amounts also approximate fair values at the reporting date.
The fair values of the derivative assets and liabilities fall within level two in the fair value hierarchy.
iv Capital structure Filtrona defines its capital structure as its equity and non-current interest bearing loans and borrowings and aims to manage this to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to shareholders and benets for other stakeholders.
Filtrona sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
Filtrona manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Filtrona may return capital to shareholders, through dividends and share buy backs, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Filtrona monitors its capital structure on the basis of the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio.
EBITDA is dened as operating profit before depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment, share option expense, intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items.
Net debt is adjusted to exclude prepaid facility fees.
During 2012, Filtronas strategy, which was unchanged from 2011, was to maintain the medium-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the range 1.0 to 2.5.
The net debt-to-EBITDA ratios at 31 December were: 2012 2011 Note m m Net debt excluding prepaid facility fees 166.0 148.7 Operating profit before intangible amortisation and exceptional operating items 105.3 84.5 Plus depreciation and other amounts written off property, plant and equipment 3 22.6 20.7 Plus share option expense 18 4.0 3.0 EBITDA 131.9 108.2 Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio 1.26 1.37 Enabling Everywhere | Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements 97 2.

Filtrona tests intangible assets annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment.
A discounted cash ow analysis is computed to compare the discounted estimated future operating cash ows to the net carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for each operating segment or business as appropriate.

t Cash ows beyond the Plan period are based on year twos Plan cash ows with growth rates specic to each business which range from nil to 3%.
t The estimated cash ows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon Filtronas estimated post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.5% 2011: 8.5% adjusted for the risk applicable to each operating segment.
Any impairment identied as a result of the analysis is expensed to the income statement.
The test is dependent on management estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash ows, and the discount rate applied to these cash ows.
The Group performed various sensitivity analyses which involved reducing future cash ows by up to 25%, reducing terminal growth rates by up to eight percentage points or increasing pre-tax discount rates by up to 100 bps.
The results of these analyses showed that, despite signicantly lower post-tax operating cash ows or increased pre-tax discount rates, the value in use of goodwill and other intangible assets continued to exceed their carrying value.

Employee benets Post-employment benets Trustees administer the schemes and the assets are held independently from Filtrona.
Pension costs of the dened benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualied actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European dened benefit schemes as at 5 April 2009 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US dened benefit schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the dened benefit schemes have been updated to the balance sheet date from the most recent actuarial valuations taking account of the investment returns achieved by the schemes and the level of contributions.
A new actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2012 has been prepared and is currently under review by the Company and the Trustees.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Dened benefit contributions in 2013 are currently under consideration by the Company and the trustees and therefore cannot be reasonably determined at the date of this report.

As a comparator, the income statement charge for 2012 under IAS 19 Amended would be 1.9m higher.
Under IAS 19 Amended, there would be a net finance expense in 2012 of 0.9m rather than a net finance income of 0.3m and the dened benefit charge to operating expense would be 2.2m rather than 1.5m.
Under IAS 19 Amended the actuarial gain, recognised in other comprehensive income, would equally be 1.9m higher in 2012.
In addition, removing the expense reserves included in pension scheme liabilities, as required under IAS 19 Amended, would result in a one-off credit to other comprehensive income and a corresponding increase in net retirement benefit assets of 4.4m in 2012.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualied actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: 2012 2011 Europe US Europe US 1 Increase in salaries pre-2010 3.00% 3.00% 3.50% 3.00% 1 Increase in salaries post-2010 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 1 Increase in pensions pre-2010 3.20% n a 3.20% n a 1 Increase in pensions post-2010 2.00% n a 2.00% n a Discount rate 4.50% 4.60% 4.70% 4.60% Ination rate 2.50% n a 2.50% n a Expected return on scheme assets 4.80% 7.10% 5.00% 7.10% 1 For service prior to April 2010, pension at retirement is linked to salary at retirement.
For service after April 2010, pension is linked to salary at April 2010 with annual increases capped at 3% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not be borne out in practice.
The life expectancy assumptions used to estimate dened benefit obligations at the year end are: 2012 2011 Europe US Europe US Male retiring today at age 65 21.3 19.2 20.8 19.1 Female retiring today at age 65 24.0 21.0 23.5 21.0 Male retiring in 20years at age 65 23.2 19.2 22.8 19.1 Female retiring in 20 years at age 65 25.9 21.0 25.5 21.0 110 Filtrona plc Annual Report 2012 Notes 18.

The expected return for each asset class is then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Acquisitions 2012 acquisitions: Securit and Jae Yong On 17 February 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Securit World Ltd Securit from the Heyden family.
Securit distributes desktop personal identication ID card systems, providing printers, software and associated accessories across a wide range of growing end-markets, including Trade Distribution, Education, Government, Health and General Industry.
The acquisition of UK-based Securit adds to the existing capabilities of Filtronas Payne Security personal ID products business and provides new opportunities in adjacent attractive growth sectors, such as Access Control and Membership.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the business acquired were adjusted to reect their fair values to Filtrona.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and subject to nalisation for up to one year from the date of acquisition.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Securit had been completed on 1 January 2012 the contribution to 2012 Group revenue would have been 10.2m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been 1.3m.
Securit contributed 8.7m to revenue and 1.1m to operating profit before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012.
Related acquisition expenses of 0.2m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.
On 23 April 2012, Filtrona acquired 100% of the share capital of Jae Yong Co. Ltd Jae Yong from the Lee family.
Based in South Korea, Jae Yong is a globally recognised manufacturer of reservoirs, nibs and tubes for the writing instruments industry, and will be reported under the Porous Technologies division.
It is estimated that if the acquisition of Jae Yong had been completed on 1 January 2012 the contribution to 2012 Group revenue would have been 2.5m and to Group operating profit before intangible amortisation would have been nil.
Jae Yong contributed 1.6m to revenue and made a 0.2m loss before intangible amortisation in the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012.
Related acquisition expenses of 0.4m were recognised in the income statement in exceptional operating items.

Acquisitions continued The deferred contingent consideration of 0.4m in respect of Jae Yong becomes payable between one and three years after completion subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions.
Property, plant and equipment, inventories, and payables were all reassessed to their fair value.

Included in the 4.9m of goodwill recognised above is the value of revenue and cost synergies and an assembled workforce.
Due to their nature these assets cannot be individually identied or measured.

Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, Filtrona plc is exempt from the requirements to present its own profit and loss account and cashow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29: Financial Instruments: Disclosures, because the published consolidated financial statements of the Group include disclosures which comply with the Standard.
The following principal accounting policies have been consistently applied.
Investment in subsidiary undertaking Investment in subsidiary undertaking is held at cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether the investment in its subsidiary has been impaired.
c. Share-based payments The fair value of share options is measured at grant date.
It is recognised as an addition to the cost of investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work over the expected period between grant and vesting date of the options, with a corresponding adjustment to reserves.
d. Own shares The shares held in the Filtrona Employee benefit Trust for the purpose of fullling obligations in respect of share incentive plans are treated as belonging to the Company and are deducted from its retained earnings.
The cost of shares held directly treasury shares is also deducted from retained earnings.
e. Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders of the Company final dividend or paid interim dividend.
f. Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Exchange differences arising from movements in spot rates are included in the profit and loss account as exchange gains or losses, while those arising from the interest differential elements of forward currency contracts are included in external interest income or expense.
g. Financial instruments Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value.
The subsequent measurement depends on the classication of the financial instrument.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings and other financial liabilities excluding derivatives are held at amortised cost.
The Company holds financial instruments which hedge the net investments in the foreign operations of its subsidiary undertakings.
Since the Company does not hold the underlying investments, gains and losses on these instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account.
