The Ore Reserve estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Ore Reserve estimates for operations in South Africa were compiled in accordance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
2 Tonnes are reported on a wet basis.
3 GEMCO Manganese grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields.
4 Mamatwan tonnages stated as wet metric tonnes.
5 Total Saleable Tonnes represents the product tonnes produced quoted as metric tonnes on a Product moisture basis.
The coal quality for Coal Reserves is quoted as either Calori c Value CV using kilo-calories per kilogram kcal kg units on a Gross As Received GAR basis or Crucible Swell Number CSN.
CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg and CSN to the nearest 0.5 index.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Metallurgical Coking, Metallurgical Other and Thermal Export collieries meet the contractual speci cations for Coking Coal, PCI, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.
Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Thermal Domestic and Synfuels collieries meet the speci cations of the individual supply contracts.
Metallurgical Coking: High-, mediumor low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry.
Metallurgical Other: Semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection PCI or other general metallurgical coal for the export or domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal.
Thermal Export: Lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation: quality measured by calori c value CV.
Thermal Domestic: Lowto high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation.
Synfuel: Coal speci cally for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals.

5 Coal Resources are quoted on a Mineable Tonnes In-Situ MTIS basis in million tonnes which are in addition to those resources which have been modi ed to produce the reported CoalReserves.
Coal Resources are on an in-situ moisture basis.

CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal kg.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
The minimum mining width over which Mineral Resources are declared is 110cm.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
