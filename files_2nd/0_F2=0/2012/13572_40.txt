Fair values have been determined with reference to available market information at the balance sheet date, using the methodologies described below.
A These primarily comprise bank deposits where the fair value approximates to the book value.
B Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
C Fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
These financial instruments are included on the balance sheet at fair value, derived from observable market prices Level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
D Borrowing and financial RRSPs are carried at amortised cost.
Fair values are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
For financial RRSPs, the contractual cash flows are based on future trading activity, which is estimated based on latest forecasts.
E T he fair value of the put option on NCI is determined in accordance with the contractual terms Level 3 as defined by IFRS 7.

Where the effectiveness of a hedging relationship in a cash flow hedge is demonstrated, changes in the fair value that are deemed effective are included in the cash flow hedge reserve and released to match actual payments on the hedged item.
The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.
The Group uses interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps to manage its exposure to movements in interest rates.

Put option on NCI and financial risk and revenue sharing partnerships RRSPs The Group has agreed a put option with Daimler AG, such that Daimler can sell its interest in Engine Holding GmbH to the Group.
The fair value of the exercise value of this option that relates to Bergen Engines AS is included as a financial liability see also note 26.
The Group has financial liabilities arising from financial RRSPs.
These financial liabilities are valued at each reporting date using the amortised cost method.
This involves calculating the present value of the forecast cash flows of the arrangements using the internal rate of return at the inception of the arrangements as the discount rate.

Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: liquidity risk: credit risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash flows most significantly US dollars, followed by the euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash flows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
The profile of the maturity of the Groups committed facilities is discussed on page 37. Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the Groups risk management activities.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the Group credit policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the Groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring the Group transacts strictly with BBB or higher rated financial institutions based on pre-established limits per financial institution.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk to individual customers or counterparties.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk, floating rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents cash flow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate profile within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at floating rates of interest as a natural hedge to the net cash position.
These are designated as either fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash flow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to three months.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.

C Shares and payments to shareholders The Company and previously Rolls-Royce Group plc, the former holding company issues non-cumulative redeemable preference shares C Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
C Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their C Shares for cash.
Any C Shares retained attract a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis in arrears, and have limited voting rights.
In certain circumstances the Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the C Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of C Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of C Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
As part of the scheme of arrangement described on page 78, all outstanding CShares issued by Rolls-Royce Group plc were redeemed on 6 April 2011.
