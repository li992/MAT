Retirement benefit obligation WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2012 2011 WHSmith Pension Trust United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme 1 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 1 a Defined benefit pension schemes i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy where the assets in the investment fund were invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2012 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 75m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of approximately 13m per annum subject to indexation over the following seven years was agreed with the Trustee.
During the year, the Group made a contribution of 13m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2011: 14m in accordance with the previously agreed pension deficit funding schedule.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet under IAS 19 in relation to this plan are as follows: m 2012 2011 Present value of the obligations 776 716 Fair value of plan assets 889 785 Surplus in the scheme 113 69 Amounts not recognised 113 69 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet The pension scheme is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustee, the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 113m 2011: 69m available on a reduction of future contributions is nil 2011: nil.
As a result the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet.
The valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.
The principal long-term assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation were: % 2012 2011 Rate of increase in pension payments 2.72 3.52 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 1.82 2.62 Discount rate 4.20 5.37 RPI inflation assumption 2.72 3.52 CPI inflation assumption 1.82 2.62 A movement of 0.1 per cent in either the discount rate or the inflation assumptions would result in a change to the scheme liabilities of approximately 15m.

Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2011: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates used are between 2.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent, reflecting expected retail price index growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is ten per cent pre-tax 2011: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the longterm growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario.
On 4 September 2012, the Group acquired a number of leasehold properties, property plant and equipment and the associated workforce from Fresh Plus Hospitality Pty Limited and Fresh Plus Leasing Pty Limited.
The company is involved in the operation of hospital cafs in Australia.
The consideration for the acquisition comprised cash and deferred cash payments, and contingent consideration payable in 2015 based on profit before tax of the acquired business in the year to 31 December 2014.
The total consideration transferred is 1m.
The fair value of inventories and property plant and equipment acquired will be less than 1m.
Goodwill of 1m will be recognised, representing the assembled workforce, synergies and future growth opportunities.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets comprise capitalised software costs that are not deemed to be an integral part of the related hardware which is classified within property, plant and equipment and certain tenancy rights.
The amortisation period for capitalised software costs is over a maximum period of five years.
Other intangible assets are either considered to have an indefinite life, therefore no amortisation has been charged, or are amortised over their useful economic life.
These assets are reviewed annually for impairment.

Included in other intangible assets are certain assets considered to have an indefinite life, 4m 2011: 4m, representing certain rights under tenancy agreements, which include the right to renew leases.
Management has determined that the useful economic life of these assets is indefinite because the Company can continue to occupy and trade from certain premises for an indefinite period.

The costs include provision for required dilapidation costs and any anticipated future rental shortfalls.
This provision has been discounted at ten per cent, and this discount will be unwound over the life of the leases.
The disposal provision arose from commitments in respect of the disposal of the USA Travel business.
The contingent consideration provision relates to the acquisition for Spilt Ink Studio Limited.
Additional consideration will be paid to the former owners of Spilt Ink Studio Limited if the company reached certain financial and non-financial targets during the years ended 31 August 2011 and 31 August 2012.

The change of rate in the year decreased the net deferred tax asset by nil 2011: nil.
The future one per cent main rate of corporation tax reduction is expected to have a similar impact on the financial statements as outlined above, however the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.

Contingent liabilities and capital commitments m 2012 2011 Bank and other loans guaranteed 4 3 Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee defaulted.
Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement with Smiths News PLC, any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between the Group and Smiths News PLC in the ratio 65:35 provided that the actual liability of Smiths News PLC in any 12-month period does not exceed 5m.
The Groups 65 per cent share of these leases has an estimated future rental commitment at 31 August 2012 of 18m 2011: 30m.
The movement in the future rental commitment is due to the crystallisation of lease liabilities, lease expiries and the effluxion of time.

Comparison of carrying values and fair values There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
Risk management The Groups Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, and to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Groups Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
WH Smith PLC Annual report and accounts 2012 65 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 23.
Financial instruments continued Capital risk The Groups objectives with respect to managing capital defined as net debt funds plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
In managing the Groups capital levels the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital requirements, forecast financing and investing cash flows.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised tax basis.
As at 11 October 2012 the Group has in place a 70m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial covenants which have been met throughout the period.
The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on fixed charges cover and net borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has a committed facility with a number of financial institutions which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
The Group has a policy of pooling cash flows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the undiscounted remaining contractual cash flows of the Groups financial liabilities: Due within Due between Due between Due over 2012 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 285 285 Total cash flows 285 285 Due within Due between Due between Due over 2011 m 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables 283 1 284 Total cash flows 283 1 284 Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, hedging, settlement and other financial activities.
The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables including a number of sale or return contracts with suppliers.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-2 A-1 and long-term ratings of A3 A or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2012, the Group had drawn down nil 2011: nil from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group draws down periodically on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.

The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar, euro and Australian dollar.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 31 August 2012, the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Groups euro and Australian dollar exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in France, Ireland and Australia.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
The fair value of cash flow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2012 2011 Fair value of derivative assets At 31 August 2012, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$25m 2011: US$47m.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring within up to two years of the balance sheet date.
Gains totalling nil 2011: nil have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2012.
In the year to 31 August 2012, the fair value loss on the Groups currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounted to nil 2011: nil.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 August 2012 Financial instruments affected by market risks include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP and EUR GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2011 and 31 August 2012 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR Base rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in USD GBP and EUR GBP exchange rates of ten per cent are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over time.
Using these assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity.
