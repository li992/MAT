Strategic Operational Leadership & Financial Additional Review Review Governance Statements Information Assets and Investments: Section 4 Other Assets and Liabilities This section details our other non-current assets and liabilities, most notably the Groupsother intangible assets, including goodwill, and the Companys investments insubsidiaries.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Impairment testing of Goodwill For the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, where the goodwill has arisen on a business combination, the remaining deferred tax liabilities that relate to the acquisition accounting are treated as part of the relevant cash generating unit.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Impairment testing of Goodwill The goodwill arising from the corporate acquisitions during the year is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount against the carrying value of the underlying oil and gas assets in the North Sea operating segment.
The recoverable amount represents fair value less costs to sell.
Where no recent third party transactions exist on which a market-based fair value can be established, Cairn has used discounted cash flow modelling techniques to determine the fair value of its exploration appraisal assets.
The use of these models requires estimates of long term oil price, discount rates, recoverable hydrocarbon reserves and the costs of development wells and production facilities.
Key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow calculations include a long term oil price of $90 per boe, a discount rate of 10% and inflation on oil prices and costs of 2.5%.
The discounted cash flow projections used to determine the fair value of intangible exploration assets with no discovered resource are risk-weighted for future exploration and appraisal success.
Given the inherent risk associated with exploration activities, these valuations are highly subjective.
Key estimates and assumptions used in the measurement of deferred tax liabilities, which are included in the cash generating unit, will also impact on the goodwill impairment test.
Impairment testing of Investments in Subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries exploration appraisal assets based on fair value calculated using the same assumptions as noted for the testing of goodwill impairment above.
4.1 Intangible Assets Other Accounting policies Goodwill In testing for impairment, goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated from the date of acquisition to the group of cash-generating units representing the lowest level at which it will be monitored.
Cairns policy is to monitor goodwill at operating segment level before combining segments for reporting.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit, or group of cash generating units, is determined by taking the higher of fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the results of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

For impairment testing, this goodwill has been allocated to the North Sea operating segment.
No impairment of goodwill was identified at 31 December 2012.
At that date, the recoverable amount of North Sea assets is not materially different from its carrying value.
The key assumptions in determining the recoverable amount of the North Sea assets are the values attributed to firm exploration prospects and the Skarfjell discovery currently under appraisal and the underlying oil price and discount rate estimates used in the discounted cash flow calculations.
The fair value attributed to exploration prospects and assets under appraisal is estimated using discounted cash flows, risk-weighted for future exploration and appraisal success.
Until completion of exploration and appraisal work programmes these valuations remain highly subjective.
A change in the assessment of technical risk could result in the carrying value equalling or exceeding the recoverable value.
The goodwill impairment test is also sensitive to changes in commodity price and discount rate.
Any reasonable change in assumptions to increase the discount rate applied or reduce the oil price assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill relating to the Greenland operating segment was fully impaired in 2011.
As the 2010 and 2011 drilling campaign offshore Greenland did not result in the discovery of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, the fair value of Greenland assets no longer supported the carrying value of the $62.8m of goodwill allocated to the operating segment.
Consequently, the remaining goodwill was fully impaired.

The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of development or producing oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, or by using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets of the subsidiary, risk-weighted for future exploration success where no development producing assets exist.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $90 bbl 2011: short and long-term oil price of $85 bbl, or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 2.5%, and a discount rate of 10% 2011: 3% and 10% respectively.

Subsequently, this subsidiary was transferred to Capricorn Oil Limited through a share-for-share exchange.
Additions during 2012 therefore include $453.1m on the acquisition of Agora.
Disposals represents the fall in the fair value of Agora at the time of the transfer to Capricorn Oil Limited, which issued 240,051,347 shares of 1 each at par as consideration for the transaction.
Consideration of $453.1m for the purchase of Agora Oil and Gas AS included $196.2m settled in cash.
A further $6.7m 2011: $5.7m was recognised as additions relating to Capricorn Oil Group for the award of share options of the Company to the employees of Capricorn Energy Limited a principal subsidiary of Capricorn Oil Limited.
Additions during 2011 included $87.7m for the issue of 56,400,000 shares of 1 each at par by Capricorn Oil Limited which reduced the amounts owed to the Company by Capricorn Oil Limited.
At the year end, investments in subsidiaries were reviewed for indicators of impairment and impairment tests conducted where indicators found.
No impairment arose at the year end.
At December 2011, the Companys investment in Capricorn Oil Limited was impaired to reflect the fair value or value in use of the underlying assets of the Capricorn Oil Group.
In 2011 a charge of $501.8m was made to the Companys Income Statement.
