Percentages in excess of 100% indicate that on average more than two passengers occupied some cabins.
2012 Compared to 2011 Revenues Consolidated Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 76% of our 2012 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues decreased by $500 million, or 4.1%, to $11.7 billion in 2012 from $12.2 billion in 2011.
This decrease was substantially due to a decrease in cruise ticket pricing, which accounted for $434 million, a stronger U. S. dollar against the euro and sterling, net of a weaker U. S. dollar against the Australian dollar referred to as the net currency impact, which accounted for $282 million, and a slight decrease in occupancy percentage, which accounted for $82 million, partially offset by our 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $348 million see Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators.
Our cruise ticket pricing and occupancy were affected by the direct and indirect consequences of the ship incident and the challenging economic environment in Europe.
The remaining 24% of 2012 total revenues were substantially all comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which increased by $156 million, or 4.6%, to $3.5 billion in 2012 from $3.4 billion in 2011.
This increase was caused by our 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $96 million, higher onboard spending by our guests, which accounted for $51 million, and the change in the accounting for our North America cruise brands and Tour and Other segments See Note 12 Segment Information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion.
These increases were partially offset by the net currency impact, which accounted for $58 million, and a slight decrease in occupancy percentage, which accounted for $23 million.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $1.1 billion in 2012, which were flat compared to 2011.
North America Brands Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 74% of our 2012 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues increased by $123 million, or 1.8%, to $6.9 billion in 2012 from $6.8 billion in 2011.
This increase was caused by our 3.4% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $229 million, partially offset by a decrease in cruise ticket pricing, which accounted for $59 million, and a decrease in air transportation revenues from guests who purchased their tickets from us, which accounted for $39 million.
Our cruise ticket pricing was affected by the indirect consequences of the ship incident.
The remaining 26% of 2012 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which increased $214 million, or 9.9%, to $2.4 billion in 2012 from $2.2 billion in 2011.
This increase was substantially due to our 3.4% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $73 million, higher onboard spending by our 46 guests, which accounted for $42 million, and the change in the accounting for our North America cruise brands and Tour and Other segments.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $727 million in 2012 and $681 million in 2011.
EAA Brands Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 82% of our 2012 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues decreased by $621 million, or 11%, to $4.8 billion in 2012 from $5.4 billion in 2011.
This decrease was caused by a decrease in cruise ticket pricing, which accounted for $354 million, the net currency impact, which accounted for $282 million, and a 2.1 percentage point decrease in occupancy, which accounted for $110 million, partially offset by our 2.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which also accounted for $110 million.
The remaining 18% of 2012 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which decreased $56 million, or 5.1%, to $1.0 billion in 2012 from $1.1 billion in 2011.
This decrease was caused by the net currency impact, which accounted for $58 million, and a 2.1 percentage point decrease in occupancy, which accounted for $23 million, partially offset by our 2.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which also accounted for $23 million.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $356 million in 2012 and $397 million in 2011.
Costs and Expenses Consolidated Operating costs and expenses of $10.3 billion in 2012 were flat compared to 2011.
Operating costs and expenses in 2012 increased due to our 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $289 million, and higher fuel prices, which accounted for $214 million.
These increases were offset by the net currency impact, which accounted for $172 million, a decrease in commissions, transportation and other costs primarily as a result of our lower cruise ticket pricing, the change in our UK brands commission structure and a decrease in air transportation costs related to guests who purchased their tickets from us, which together accounted for $158 million, lower fuel consumption per ALBD, which accounted for $89 million, and a slight decrease in occupancy percentage, which accounted for $27 million.
In addition, operating costs and expenses in 2012 increased as a result of Costa Allegras impairment charge and incident-related expenses, which together accounted for $51 million, and the ship incident-related expenses that were not covered by insurance, which accounted for $28 million, partially offset by Costas excess insurance proceeds and a gain from Cunards litigation settlement, which together accounted for $34 million, and the nonrecurrence in 2012 of $28 million of ship impairment charges recognized in 2011 related to the sale of Costa Marina and Pacific Sun the net impact of these changes in operating costs and expenses are referred to as the other net charges related to our EAA brands, which combined accounted for $17 million.
Selling and administrative expenses of $1.7 billion in 2012 were flat compared to 2011.
Depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.5 billion in 2012 were flat compared to 2011.
Ibero goodwill and trademark impairment charges of $173 million were recorded in 2012.
See Note 11 - Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these impairment charges.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 89% in 2012 from 86% in 2011.
47 North America Brands Operating costs and expenses increased $286 million, or 4.9%, to $6.1 billion in 2012 from $5.8 billion in 2011.
This increase was caused by our 3.4% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $198 million, higher fuel prices, which accounted for $147 million, and the change in the accounting for our North America cruise brands and Tour and Other segments.
These increases were partially offset by a decrease in commissions, transportation and other costs primarily as a result of our lower cruise ticket pricing and a decrease in air transportation costs related to guests who purchased their tickets from us, which together accounted for $46 million, and lower fuel consumption per ALBD, which accounted for $44 million.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues of 86% in 2012 was flat compared to 2011.
EAA Brands Operating costs and expenses decreased $234 million, or 5.5%, to $4.0 billion in 2012 from $4.2 billion in 2011.
This decrease was caused by the net currency impact, which accounted for $172 million, a decrease in commissions, transportation and other costs primarily as a result of our lower cruise ticket pricing, the change in our UK brands commission structure and a decrease in air transportation costs related to guests who purchased their tickets from us, which together accounted for $103 million, lower fuel consumption per ALBD, which accounted for $45 million, a 2.1 percentage point decrease in occupancy percentage, which accounted for $36 million, and the other net charges related to our EAA brands, which accounted for $17 million.
These decreases were partially offset by our 2.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $87 million, and higher fuel prices, which accounted for $67 million.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 93% in 2012 from 84% in 2011.
Operating Income Our consolidated operating income decreased $613 million, or 27%, to $1.6 billion in 2012 from $2.3 billion in 2011.
Our North America brands operating income of $1.3 billion in 2012 was flat compared to 2011, and our EAA brands operating income decreased $593 million, or 58%, to $433 million in 2012 from $1.0 billion in 2011.
These changes were principally due to the reasons discussed above.
Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators ALBDs is a standard measure of passenger capacity for the period, which we use to perform rate and capacity variance analyses to determine the main non-capacity driven factors that cause our cruise revenues and expenses to vary.
ALBDs assume that each cabin we offer for sale accommodates two passengers and is computed by multiplying passenger capacity by revenue-producing ship operating days in the period.
We use net cruise revenues per ALBD net revenue yields, net cruise costs per ALBD and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD as significant non-GAAP financial measures of our cruise segment financial performance.
These measures enable us to separate the impact of predictable capacity changes from the more unpredictable rate changes that affect our business.
We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors and expanded insight to measure our revenue and cost performance as a supplement to our U. S. GAAP consolidated financial statements.
Net revenue yields are commonly used in the cruise business to measure a companys cruise segment revenue performance and for revenue management purposes.
We use net cruise revenues rather than gross cruise revenues to calculate net revenue yields.
We believe that net cruise revenues is a more meaningful measure in determining revenue yield than gross cruise revenues because it reflects the cruise revenues earned net of our 48 most significant variable costs, which are travel agent commissions, cost of air and other transportation, certain other costs that are directly associated with onboard and other revenues and credit card fees.
Substantially all of our remaining cruise costs are largely fixed, except for the impact of changing prices and food expenses, once our capacity levels have been determined.
Net passenger ticket revenues reflect gross cruise revenues, net of 1 onboard and other revenues, 2 commissions, transportation and other costs and 3 onboard and other cruise costs.
Net onboard and other revenues reflect gross cruise revenues, net of 1 passenger ticket revenues, 2 commissions, transportation and other costs and 3 onboard and other cruise costs.
Net passenger ticket revenue yields and net onboard and other revenue yields are computed by dividing net passenger ticket revenues and net onboard and other revenues by ALBDs.
Net cruise costs per ALBD and net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD are the most significant measures we use to monitor our ability to control our cruise segment costs rather than gross cruise costs per ALBD.
We exclude the same variable costs that are included in the calculation of net cruise revenues to calculate net cruise costs with and without fuel to avoid duplicating these variable costs in our non-GAAP financial measures.
In addition, because our EAA brands utilize the euro, sterling and Australian dollar to measure their results and financial condition, the translation of those operations to our U. S. dollar reporting currency results in decreases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar strengthens against these foreign currencies and increases in reported U. S. dollar revenues and expenses if the U. S. dollar weakens against these foreign currencies.
Accordingly, we also monitor and report these non-GAAP financial measures assuming the 2012 and 2011 periods currency exchange rates have remained constant with the 2011 and 2010 periods rates, respectively, or on a constant dollar basis, in order to remove the impact of changes in exchange rates on our non-U.
We believe that this is a useful measure since it facilitates a comparative view of the growth of our business in a fluctuating currency exchange rate environment.
We believe that the impairment charges recognized in 2012 related to Iberos goodwill and trademarks are nonrecurring and, therefore, are not an indication of our future earnings performance.
As such, we believe it is more meaningful for the impairment charges to be excluded from our net income and earnings per share and, accordingly, we present non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS excluding these impairment charges.
Under U. S. GAAP, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives not qualifying as fuel hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.
We believe that unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives are not an indication of our earnings performance since they relate to future periods and may not ultimately be realized in our future earnings.
Therefore, we believe it is more meaningful for the unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives to be excluded from our net income and EPS and, accordingly, we present a non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS excluding these unrealized gains and losses.
We have not included in our earnings guidance the impact of unrealized gains and losses on fuel derivatives because these unrealized amounts involve a significant amount of uncertainty, and we do not believe they are an indication of our future earnings performance.
Accordingly, our earnings guidance is presented on a non-GAAP basis only.
As a result, we did not present a reconciliation between forecasted non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance and forecasted U. S. GAAP diluted EPS guidance, since we do not believe that the reconciliation information would be meaningful.
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
The presentation of our nonGAAP financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared in accordance with U. S. GAAP.
There are no specific rules for determining our non-GAAP current and constant dollar financial measures and, accordingly, they are susceptible to varying calculations, and it is possible that they may not be exactly comparable to the like-kind information presented by other companies, which is a potential risk associated with using these measures to compare us to other companies.
Net cruise revenues decreased $227 million, or 1.8%, to $12.3 billion in 2012 from $12.5 billion in 2011.
This was caused by a 2.5% decrease in constant dollar net revenue yields, which accounted for $321 million, and the net currency impact, which accounted for $267 million, partially offset by our 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $361 million.
The 2.5% decrease in net revenue yields on a constant dollar basis was comprised of a 3.9% decrease in net passenger ticket revenue yields, partially offset by a 2.4% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
The 3.9% decrease in net passenger ticket revenue yields was principally due to our EAA brands with a 7.6% yield decrease, which was affected by the direct and indirect consequences of the ship incident and the challenging economic environment in Europe.
The 2.4% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields was primarily due to higher onboard spending by guests from our North America brands, partially offset by lower yields from certain of our EAA brands, driven by lower occupancy, principally at Costa.
Gross cruise revenues decreased $344 million, or 2.2%, to $15.2 billion in 2012 from $15.5 billion in 2011 for largely the same reasons as discussed above.
Net cruise costs excluding fuel of $6.6 billion in 2012 were flat compared to 2011.
Our 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $190 million, was offset by the net currency impact, which accounted for $135 million, and a slight decrease in constant dollar net cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD, which accounted for $38 million.
Fuel costs increased $188 million, or 8.6%, to $2.4 billion in 2012 from $2.2 billion in 2011.
This was caused by higher fuel prices, which accounted for $214 million, and a 2.9% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $63 million, partially offset by lower fuel consumption per ALBD, which accounted for $89 million.
Gross cruise costs increased $88 million, or 0.7% to $11.9 billion in 2012 from $11.8 billion in 2011 for principally the same reasons as discussed above.
2011 Compared to 2010 Revenues Consolidated Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 77% of our 2011 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues increased by $1.1 billion, or 9.7%, to $12.2 billion in 2011 from $11.1 billion in 2010.
This increase was 51 substantially due to our 5.1% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $571 million, a weaker U. S. dollar against the euro, sterling and Australian dollar referred to as the currency impact, which accounted for $257 million, an overall continuing recovery in cruise ticket pricing, which accounted for $155 million, and a slight increase in occupancy percentage, which accounted for $63 million.
Our 2011 cruise passenger ticket pricing increase was affected by the close-in deployment changes resulting from the geo-political events in the Middle East and North Africa MENA, and to a lesser extent, the earthquake and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan as well as the European debt crisis see Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators.
The remaining 23% of 2011 total revenues were substantially all comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which increased by $253 million, or 8.1%, to $3.4 billion in 2011 from $3.1 billion in 2010.
This increase was principally driven by our 5.1% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $160 million, and the currency impact, which accounted for $58 million.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $1.1 billion in 2011 and $958 million in 2010.
North America Brands Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 76% of our 2011 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues increased by $444 million, or 7.0%, to $6.8 billion in 2011 from $6.3 billion in 2010.
This increase was substantially due to a continuing recovery in cruise ticket pricing, particularly in the second half of 2011, which accounted for $186 million, our 2.8% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $176 million, and a 1.1 percentage point increase in occupancy, which accounted for $66 million.
The remaining 24% of 2011 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which increased $98 million, or 4.8%, to $2.2 billion in 2011 from $2.1 billion in 2010.
This increase was primarily driven by our 2.8% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $57 million.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $681 million in 2011 and $628 million in 2010.
EAA Brands Cruise passenger ticket revenues made up 83% of our 2011 total revenues.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues increased $633 million, or 13%, to $5.4 billion in 2011 from $4.8 billion in 2010.
This increase was caused by our 9.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $431 million, and the currency impact, which accounted for $257 million.
Cruise passenger ticket revenues were impacted by the close-in MENA deployment changes.
The remaining 17% of 2011 total revenues were comprised of onboard and other cruise revenues, which increased $141 million, or 15%, to $1.1 billion in 2011 from $1.0 billion in 2010.
This increase was caused by our 9.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $87 million, and the currency impact, which accounted for $58 million.
Onboard and other revenues included concession revenues of $397 million in 2011 and $330 million in 2010.
Costs and Expenses Consolidated Operating costs and expenses increased $1.2 billion, or 13%, to $10.3 billion in 2011 from $9.1 billion in 2010.
This increase was substantially due to higher fuel prices, which accounted for $535 million, our 5.1% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $457 million, the currency impact, which accounted for $143 million, and inflationary pressures on crew travel, food, freight and other hotel operating expenses.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $103 million, or 6.4%, to $1.7 billion in 2011 from $1.6 billion in 2010.
52 Depreciation and amortization expense increased $106 million, or 7.5%, to $1.5 billion in 2011 from $1.4 billion in 2010.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to 86% in 2011 from 84% in 2010.
North America Brands Operating costs and expenses increased $554 million, or 10%, to $5.8 billion in 2011 from $5.3 billion in 2010.
This increase was principally due to higher fuel prices, which accounted for $328 million, and our 2.8% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $148 million.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 86% in 2011 from 84% in 2010.
EAA Brands Operating costs and expenses increased $672 million, or 19%, to $4.2 billion in 2011 from $3.6 billion in 2010.
This increase was caused by our 9.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $323 million, higher fuel prices, which accounted for $207 million, and the currency impact, which accounted for $143 million.
Selling and administrative expenses increased $71 million, or 12%, to $655 million in 2011 from $584 million in 2010.
The increase was caused by our 9.0% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $53 million, and the currency impact, which accounted for $29 million.
Depreciation and amortization expense increased $74 million, or 15%, to $579 million in 2011 from $505 million in 2010.
The increase was substantially due to $46 million from our 9.0% capacity increase in ALBDs principally through the addition of new ships and the currency impact, which accounted for $26 million.
Our total costs and expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to 84% in 2011 from 81% in 2010.
Operating Income Our consolidated operating income of $2.3 billion decreased slightly in 2011 compared to 2010.
Our North America brands operating income of $1.3 billion decreased $74 million, or 5.5%, in 2011 compared to 2010, and our EAA brands operating income of $1.0 billion decreased $43 million, or 4.0%, in 2011 compared to 2010.
These decreases were principally due to the reasons discussed above.
Key Performance Non-GAAP Financial Indicators Net cruise revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 9.7%, to $12.5 billion in 2011 from $11.4 billion in 2010.
This was caused by a 5.1% capacity increase in ALBDs, which accounted for $589 million, the currency impact, which accounted for $265 million, and a 2.1% increase in constant dollar net revenue yields, which accounted for $253 million.
The 2.1% increase in net revenue yields on a constant dollar basis was comprised of a 2.3% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields and a 1.4% increase in net onboard and other revenue yields.
The 2.3% increase in net passenger ticket revenue yields was driven by the continuing recovery in pricing at our North American brands as they achieved an almost four percent net revenue yield increase while our EAA brands net revenue yields were in line with the prior year despite all of their challenges, including MENA, the earthquake and resulting nuclear disaster in Japan and the European debt crisis.
Gross cruise revenues increased $1.3 billion, or 9.4%, to $15.5 billion in 2011 from $14.2 billion in 2010 for largely the same reasons as discussed above.
