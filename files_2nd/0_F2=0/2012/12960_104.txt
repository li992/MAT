Non-GAAP information Randgold has identied certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the performance of the business.
As the measures are not dened under IFRS they may not be directly comparable with other companies adjusted measures.
The non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key measures used within the business for assessing performance.
Previously, total cash cost and cash operating cost only included costs associated with activities at each operating mine.
The group has changed the treatment of total cash cost and cash operating cost, by including all costs and activities across the group after elimination of intra group transactions.
This does not impact the individual mines as the adjustment reects consolidation level adjustments.
All comparative periods have been restated accordingly.
These measures are explained further below: Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute.
The Gold Institute was a non-profit industry association comprising leading gold producers, reners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers.
This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as dened in the Gold Institutes guidance, include mine production, transport and renery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping where relevant and royalties.
Under the companys accounting policies, there are no transfers to and from deferred stripping.
Total cash cost per ounce is calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented.
As discussed above, the treatment of total cash costs and cash operating costs have been amended and all comparative periods have been adjusted accordingly.
Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures or an indicator of our performance.
The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
In particular depreciation and amortisation would be included in a measure of total costs of producing gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a denition for the calculation of total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold believes that total cash cost per ounce are useful indicators to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the companys operations mature, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties from total cash costs.
Cash operating costs per ounce are calculated by dividing cash operating costs by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Gold sales is a non-GAAP measure.
It represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains losses on hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date.
It excludes gains losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales.
This adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received paid in respect of these contracts.
profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all periods presented.
The group changed its accounting policy on production phase stripping costs with effect from 1 January 2012.
As a result, the 2011 results have been restated refer to pages 161 and 162 of this annual report for further details.
