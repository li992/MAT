Operating leases In the case of an operating lease entered into by BP as the operator of a jointly controlled asset, the amounts shown in the tables below represent the net operating lease expense and net future minimum lease payments.
These net amounts are after deducting amounts reimbursed, or to be reimbursed, by joint venture partners, whether the joint venture partners have co-signed the lease or not.
Where BP is not the operator of a jointly controlled asset, BPs share of the lease expense and future minimum lease payments is included in the amounts shown, whether BP has co-signed the lease or not.
The table below shows the expense for the year in respect of operating leases.

Typical durations of the leases are as follows: Years Ships up to 15 Plant and machinery up to 10 Commercial vehicles up to 15 Land and buildings up to 40 The group has entered into a number of structured operating leases for ships and in most cases the lease rental payments vary with market interest rates.
The variable portion of the lease payments above or below the amount based on the market interest rate prevailing at inception of the lease is treated as contingent rental expense.
The group also routinely enters into bareboat charters, time-charters and spot-charters for ships on standard industry terms.
The most significant items of plant and machinery hired under operating leases are drilling rigs used in the Upstream segment.
At 31 December 2012, the future minimum lease payments relating to drilling rigs amounted to $8,527 million 2011 $6,292 million.
Commercial vehicles hired under operating leases are primarily railcars.
Retail service station sites and office accommodation are the main items inthe land and buildings category.
The terms and conditions of these operating leases do not impose any significant financial restrictions on the group.
Some of the leases of ships and buildings allow for renewals at BPs option, and some of the groups operating leases contain escalation clauses.
