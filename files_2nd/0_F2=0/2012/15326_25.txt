Accounting Policies The Companys principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
Where an accounting policy is specic to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities.
The accounting policies adopted for specic financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Loans and other borrowings Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, and bank overdrafts.
These are initially measured at fair value which is equal to cost at inception, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, except where they are identied as a hedged item in a fair value hedge.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external nancing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.
Share-based payments The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Share-based payments issued by the Company to its subsidiary undertakings are treated as additions to investments based on the fair value of the grant, spread over the relevant vesting period, with corresponding credit to reserves.
Where the Company recharges the cost of share-based payments to its subsidiary undertaking the investment is reduced accordingly.
Further details are provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exception: Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis with the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The taxation liabilities of certain Group companies are reduced wholly or in part by the surrender of losses by fellow Group companies.
