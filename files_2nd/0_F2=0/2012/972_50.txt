In accordance with IFRS the Group is required to fair value 100% of the assets and liabilities acquired based on the purchase consideration for the 40% acquired.
As a result the Group has: Recognised a fair value uplift of $2,017 million relating to its existing 45% shareholding, with a corresponding special item remeasurement gain in the income statement.
The additional depreciation arising as a result of the fair value uplifts on the Groups existing 45% shareholding has also been recognised as a special item remeasurement and amounted to $41 million in 2012 and is estimated to be $125 million in 2013.
Recognised fair value uplifts associated with the additional 55% to be consolidated, including the Government of Botswanas 15% non-controlling interest.
The additional depreciation and amortisation charge reduced operating pro t by $50 million in 2012 and is estimated to be $150 million in 2013.
The additional depreciation and amortisation charge reduced underlying earnings by $32 million in 2012 and is estimated to reduce underlying earnings by $100million in 2013.
The following tables reconcile the earnings and capital expenditure of fide Beers to the amounts included in the Groups Consolidated financial statements and illustrate the earnings impact of the requirement to fair value assets and liabilities acquired.

The joint venture arrangements provide fide Beers with an economic interest in Debswana that is based on 19.2% of pro ts before deducting taxes and royalties paid by the joint venture.
Consistent with these arrangements, fide Beers proportionately consolidates 19.2% of Debswanas earnings before taxes and royalties in line with the Groups policy on accounting for joint ventures.
As fide Beers share of earnings is based on pro ts before taxes and royalties, an effective tax rate of nil arises on the earnings of the joint venture in the Groups Consolidated financial statements.
2 Relates to assets fair valued on acquisition where the treatment in fide Beers underlying financial statements post-acquisition is already re ected in the Groups financial statements.
3 Excludes the depreciation of fair value uplifts on the Groups previously held 45% equity interest.
4 Relates to the depreciation of fair value uplifts on the Groups previously held 45% equity interest upon obtaining a controlling interest.
5 Inventory held by fide Beers at the date of the acquisition is required to be recognised at fair value under IFRS.
This results in negligible margins upon the subsequent sale of inventory held at the date of the acquisition.
The impact of fair value uplifts on inventory has been excluded from the Groups underlying earnings so as not to distort the operating margins of fide Beers and to provide more useful information about the performance of the Group.
