The Group recognises the benefit of tax losses only to the extent of anticipated future taxable income or gains in relevant jurisdictions.
The gross amount of tax losses carried forward that have not been tax effected expire as follows: Australia UK Rest of world Total losses Year of expiry US$M US$M US$M US$M Income tax losses Not later than one year 2 2 Later than one year and not later than two years 2 2 Later than two years and not later than five years 1,553 1,553 Later than five years and not later than ten years 149 149 Later than ten years and not later than twenty years 187 187 Unlimited 88 52 140 88 1,945 2,033 Capital tax losses Later than two years and not later than five years 7 7 Unlimited 2,893 6 24 2,923 Gross amount of tax losses not recognised 2,893 94 1,976 4,963 Tax effect of total losses not recognised 868 22 258 1,148 Tax credits At 30 June 2012, the Group had US$397 million of tax credits that have not been recognised 2011: US$344 million.
Temporary differences relating to MRRT and PRRT At 30 June 2012, the Group had US$19,338 million of unrecognised deductible temporary differences 2011: US$ nil that arose due to the enactment of the Australian MRRT and PRRT extension legislation in March 2012.
Recognition of a deferred tax asset for MRRT and PRRT depends on benefits expected to be obtained from deduction against MRRT and PRRT liabilities based on the 1 May 2010 market value of Australian coal, iron ore and petroleum assets.
Recognition of a deferred tax asset associated with MRRT and PRRT of US$19,338 million 2011: US$ nil would result in a corresponding additional deferred tax liability for income tax purposes of US$5,801 million 2011: US$ nil.
Other deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2012, the Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$3,192 million 2011: US$3,119 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2012, deferred tax liabilities of US$1,997 million 2011: US$2,096 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.

b Diluted earnings are calculated after adding back dividend equivalent payments of US$ nil 2011: US$ nil: 2010: US$21 million that would not be made if potential ordinary shares were converted to fully paid.
As permitted by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, from 1 July 2010 the Group has elected to incorporate the value of dividend equivalent payment entitlements into the grant date fair value of the associated equity-settled share-based payment awards.
Previously, the Group elected to measure and recognise the dividend equivalent payment as a separate cash-settled share-based payment.
Comparative amounts have not been restated.
c The calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings per share is the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc outstanding during the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton share repurchase scheme, the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust, and the BHP Bonus Equity Plan Trust and adjusting for the BHP Billiton Limited bonus share issue.
Included in the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share are shares contingently issuable under Employee Share Ownership Plans.
d Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes 2,943,856 of instruments 2011: 2,210,433: 2010: 5,372,381 which are considered antidilutive.
