Financial statements and other information The British Land Company PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 110 OVERVIEW UNDERSTANDING STRATEGY OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 9 STAFF COSTS continued Staff costs The Groups equity-settled share-based payments comprise the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Matching Share Plan MSP, the Fund Managers Performance Plan FMPP, the Share Incentive Plan SIP, various Sharesave Plans and four recruitment schemes relating to Executive Board members.
The Company expenses an estimate of how many shares are likely to vest based on the market price at the date of grant, taking account of expected performance against the relevant performance targets and service periods.
Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP Under the LTIP the Company may award employees a combination of performance shares and options.
Both components have the same performance targets based on Net Asset Value per share growth and a three-year service period.
For both LTIP components the Company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that estimate over the relevant period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends, see table below.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price over a four-year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
No other features of the option grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

The Company expenses the estimated number of shares likely to vest over the three-year period based on the market price at the date of grant.
Fund Managers Performance Plan FMPP Under the FMPP the Company may award employees a combination of cash 20% of the award and shares based on a maximum of 30% of the annual performance fee earned by the Unit Trusts and, as agreed by shareholders in 2008, in respect of a comparative notional pool for British Land-owned portfolios.
The cash is awarded following the performance year under review with the shares released over the following three years subject to clawback due to subsequent property underperformance.
The Company expenses an estimate of the fair value of the award over the period to full vesting.
Other share plans Under the SIP the Company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,000 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,500 a year that are matched two for one by the Company.
The free and matching shares are either purchased at fair value in the market or allotted and expensed at the time of allocation.
Under the Sharesave Plans eligible employees can save up to 250 a month over a threeor five-year period and use the savings to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20% discount to the then prevailing share price.
The fair value of the various options is expensed over the service period, based on a Black-Scholes model.
Awards under the four recruitment schemes are valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and expensed over the period to vesting.
Movements in shares and options are given in note 21.
The British Land Company PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements and other information 111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 10 PENSIONS The British Land Group of Companies Pension Scheme the scheme is the principal pension scheme in the Group.
It is a defined benefit scheme which is externally funded and not contracted out of SERPS.
The assets of the scheme are held in a trustee-administered fund and kept separate from those of the Company.
It is not planned to admit new employees to the scheme.
Existing entitlements will be retained by the members, with freedom to transfer to a new Defined Contribution Scheme.
Contributions to this scheme are at a flat rate of 15% of salary and paid by the Company.
In certain circumstances it may be necessary to pay higher contributions when recruiting senior executives.
The Group has three other small pension schemes.
The total net pension cost charged for the year was 5m 2011: 5m, of which 2m 2011: 2m relates to defined contribution plans.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2009 by consulting actuaries, AON Hewitt Associates Ltd.
The employers contributions will be paid in the future at the rate recommended by the actuary of 45.2% per annum of basic salaries.
The best estimate of employer contributions expected to be paid during the year to 31 March 2013 is 3m.
The major assumptions used for the actuarial valuation were: 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 4.6 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 Salary inflation 4.7 5.2 5.4 4.4 3.4 Pensions increase 3.1 3.7 3.9 2.9 3.4 Price inflation 3.2 3.7 3.9 2.9 5.6 The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 60 will live on average to age 90 if they are male and to age 91 if they are female.
For a member who is currently 40 and retires in 2032 at age 60, the assumptions are that they will live on average for a further 33.2 years after retirement to age 93 if they are male and forafurther 33.9 years after retirement to age 94 if they are female.

Historicalmarkets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over their allocation for the Scheme at 31 March 2012.

The historical cost of properties was 4,264m 2011: 3,816m.
The property valuation does not include any investment properties held under operating leases 2011: nil.
At 31 March 2012, 47m of investment properties were reclassified to trading properties as it was determined that the Groups intention was to redevelop and sell these properties.
Properties valued at 1,827m 2011: 2,850m were subject to a security interest and other properties of non-recourse companies amounted to 49m 2011: nil.
Included within the property valuation is 86m 2011: 76m in respect of accrued contracted rental uplift income, against which the Group holds a provision of 5m 2011: 5m.
The balance arises through the IFRS treatment of leases containing such arrangements, which requires the recognition of rental income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the difference between this and the cash receipt changing the carrying value of the property against which revaluations are measured.
Cumulative interest capitalised against investment properties amounts to 78m 2011: 73m.
Included in investment properties are 444m of properties which are in the course of development 2011: 149m.

Financial statements and other information The British Land Company PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 124 OVERVIEW UNDERSTANDING STRATEGY OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 18 NET DEBT continued Capital risk management The Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are set out in the financial policies on pages 65 to 67.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt and equity attributable to the equity holders of The British Land Company PLC, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
Interest rate risk management The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to the variability in cash flows on floating rate debt, such as revolving bank facilities and floating rate bonds caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2012 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39, is a net liability of 87m 2011: liability of 38m.
The cross currency swap, which fully hedges the foreign exchange exposure on the 2015 US Private Placement, has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
The market value of this is nil 2011: asset of 1m.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement on cash flow hedges in the year ended 31 March 2012 was nil 2011: nil.
The cash flows occur and enter into the determination of profit and loss until the maturity of the hedged debt.
The table below summarises foreign currency denominated debt and variable rate debt hedged at 31 March 2012.
Cash flow hedged debt 2012 2011 m m Outstanding: at one year 1,269 680 at two years 1,123 680 at five years 44 at ten years 250 250 The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge exposure on fixed rate financial liabilities caused by movements in market rates of interest.
At 31 March 2012 the market value of these derivatives, which have been designated as fair value hedges under IAS 39, is a net asset of 72m 2011: 4m.
The cross currency swaps of the 2018 2021 2023 2026 US Private Placements fully hedge the foreign exchange exposure at an average floating rate of 146 basis points above LIBOR.
These have been designated as fair value hedges of the US Private Placements.

At 31 March 2012 the weighted average interest rate of the Sterling fixed rate debt is 5.27% 2011: 5.65%.
The weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 12.1 years 2011: 16.3 years.
The weighted average interest rate for the Euro fixed rate debt is 4.44% 2011: 4.46% and the weighted average period for which the rate is fixed is 4.2 years 2011: 5.2 years.
The floating rate debt is set for periods of the Companys choosing at the relevant LIBOR or similar rate.
The proportion of net debt at fixed or capped rates of interest was 86% at 31 March 2012.
Based on the Groups interest rate profile at the balance sheet date a 576 bps increase in interest rates would decrease annual profits by 19m 2011: 27m decrease.
Similarly, a 103 bps reduction would increase profits by 3m 2011: 4m increase.
The change in interest rates used for this sensitivity analysis is based on the largest annual change in three month Sterling LIBOR over the last ten years.
Upward movements in mediumand long-term interest rates, associated with higher interest rate expectations, increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps that provide protection against such moves.
The converse is true for downward movements in the yield curve.
The majority of the Groups interest rate swaps qualify as effective hedges under IAS 39 therefore movements in their fair value are recognised directly in equity rather than the income statement.
A 204 bps shift represents the largest annual change in the The British Land Company PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements and other information 125 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 18 NET DEBT continued seven year Sterling swap rate over the last ten years.
At 31 March 2012 a 204 bps parallel upward shift in swap rates would increase the value of the Groups interest rate swaps by 24m 2011: 24m.
A 204 bps downward shift in swap rates would reduce the value of the interest rate swap portfolio by 28m 2011: 51m.
Because the interest rate swaps are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flows of such movements is minimal.
Foreign currency risk management Group policy is to have no material unhedged net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas investments is hedged via foreign currency denominated borrowings and derivatives.
The Group has adopted net investment hedging in accordance with IAS 39 and therefore the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The table below shows the carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Provided contingent tax on overseas investments is not expected to occur it will be ignored for hedging purposes, as will the requirement to fair value interest rate swaps.
This explains the excess of Euro denominated liabilities over assets.
Based on the 31 March 2012 position a 33% appreciation largest annual change over the last ten years in the Euro relative to Sterling would result in a 5m reduction 2011: 3m reduction in reported profits.

Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2012 amounted to 137m 2011: 60m.
Deposits were placed with financial institutions with A or better credit ratings.
At 31 March 2012, the fair value of all interest rate derivatives which had a positive value was 73m 2011: 11m.
At 31 March 2012, the fair value of liquid investments was 200m 2011: 203m.
At 31 March 2012, prior to taking into account any offset arrangements, the largest combined credit exposure to a single counterparty arising from money market deposits, liquid investments and interest rate swaps was 230m 2011: 123m.
This represents 2.8% 2011: 1.7% of gross assets.
The deposits and liquid investments exposures are with UK high street banks.
The Groups exposure to credit risk in respect of its trade receivables is analysed in note 14.
Included within trade and other debtors is deferred consideration of 22m, of which 4m may fall due after one year.
Management has made due consideration of the credit risk associated with this, resulting in no impairment for credit risk being made.
Provisions are made taking account historic credit losses and the credit worthiness of debtors.

The table below presents a maturity profile of the contracted undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal flows.
Where the interest payable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest rates implied by yield curves at the reporting date.
For derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis e. g. interest rate swaps the undiscounted net cash flows are shown and for derivatives that require gross settlement e. g. cross currency swaps the undiscounted gross cash flows are presented.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.
Trade creditors and amounts owed to joint ventures, which are repayable within one year, have been excluded from the analysis.
The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources, including a secure rental income profile, asset sales, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the longer term, debt refinancings.
The Group leases out all its investment properties under operating leases with a weighted average lease length of 12 years.
This secure income profile is generated from upward only rent reviews, long leases and high occupancy rates.
The future aggregate minimum rentals receivable under non-cancellable operating leases is also shown in the table below.
Income from joint ventures and funds is not included below.
Additional liquidity will arise from letting space in properties under construction as well as from distributions received from joint ventures and funds.
