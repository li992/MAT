The dened benefit section of the DB Section and the Britvic Executive Top-Up Scheme BETUS were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011.
Most active members transferred to the dened contribution section of the DB Section, but the two executive directors opted to cease tax-relievable pension provision at the point of closure and instead now receive a cash sum in lieu of pension contributions.
The cash sum received by Paul Moody equates to 24.6% of basic salary and that received by John Gibney equates to 22% of basic salary.
The accrued pensions and transfer values listed above are calculated on the basis of entitlements accrued to 10 April 2011, but calculated where relevant in line with market conditions at 30 September 2012.
The entitlements shown also include increases to accrued pensions since date of leaving dened benefit service for deferred members which are required under the rules of the DB Plan and the BETUS, the aim of which are to increase the benets in line with price ination between the date of leaving pensionable service in the DB Section and the BETUS and the date when benets are drawn.
The increase due on 1 October 2012 has been included in the above gures.
The transfer values shown have been calculated in accordance with relevant regulations, which are before allowances for any discretionary options available.
In line with normal application of the EERF policy for legacy DB pension members, the committee agreed to apply its discretion to allow Paul Moody to use the EERF upon completion of the proposed merger.
The cost to the company of EERF is approximately 1.1M.
The associated total liabilities of the BETUS in relation to Paul Moody are approximately 3.6M on an IAS19 basis in the company accounts.
In order to reduce the BETUS related company balance sheet exposure sooner, the committee agreed to a one off payment to Paul Moody of 2.85M which eliminates all current and future entitlements under BETUS for him.
Taking into account employer NIC costs, this represents a saving of 10% to the company.
Following conrmation from the takeover panel, the committee also agreed to adopt this approach on a discretionary basis as an ongoing policy that could be applied to all BETUS members.
