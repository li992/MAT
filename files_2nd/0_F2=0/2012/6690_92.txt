In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation.
Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into four reportable segments, Deregulated Bus, Regulated Bus, Rail and Go-Ahead North America.
Operating segments within those reportable divisions are combined on the basis of their long term characteristics and similar nature of their products and services, as follows: The Deregulated Bus division comprises bus operations outside London.
The Regulated Bus division comprises bus operations in London under control of Transport for London TfL.
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London Midland.
The Go-Ahead North America division comprises a 50% investment in a US school bus operation.
The Groups share of the profit of this division is currently nil 2011: nil, and it is therefore not included within the tables below.
The information reported to the Group Chief Executive in his capacity as Chief Operating Decision Maker does not include an analysis of assets and liabilities and accordingly IFRS 8 does not require this information to be presented.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.
The following tables present information regarding the Groups reportable segments for the year ended 30 June 2012 and the year ended 2 July 2011.
