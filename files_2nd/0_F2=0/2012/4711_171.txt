Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information For the main plans in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States, the salary increase assumptions include an allowance for age related promotional salary increases.
For example in the United Kingdom salary increase assumptions comprise one percentage point above RPI inflation and 0.1 of a percentage point 2011 and 2010 0.3 of a percentage point for age related promotional salary increases.
The assumption for medical inflation in the United States reduces by 0.5% per year until it reaches 5%.
In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the UK Scheme is based on the CMI birth year tables with scaling factors based on the experience of the plan and with suitable future improvements.
The mortality assumption for the Irish Scheme is also based on the mortality experience of that plan with suitable future improvements.
The mortality assumptions for the other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables and standard mortality improvements in each country.
