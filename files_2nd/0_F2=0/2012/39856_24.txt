GENERAL INFORMATION GROUP AND COMPANY INFORMATION The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 30 September 2012 comprise the results of the Company, its subsidiaries and joint venture and were approved by the Board for issue on 29 November 2012.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review on pages 14 to 17.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is given on page 49.
BASIS OF PREPARATION These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and the measurement of derivative financial instruments at fair value through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently in all periods presented in these financial statements.
The Company has not presented its own Statement of Comprehensive Income, as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Company made a profit of 0.1 million 2011: loss 1.3 million in the year.
GOING CONCERN The Group adopts the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements as explained in the Business Review on pages 14 to 17.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES The preparation of these financial statements requires the Board to make judgements, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and Balance Sheets.
Such decisions are made at the time the financial statements are prepared and adopted based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time.
Actual outcomes may be different from initial estimates and are reflected in the financial statements as soon as they become apparent.
The measurement of fair value constitutes a significant estimate by the Board in the preparation of these financial statements.
Thefair valuations of investment properties, derivative financial instruments and share based payments are carried out by external advisors whom the Board considers to be suitably qualified to carry out such valuations.
In the case of share based payments, assumptions regarding the option vesting assumptions are made by the directors.

SUBSIDIARIES Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the financial and operating activities of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision in respect of any permanent impairment loss.
JOINT VENTURES Joint ventures are those entities over which the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the proportional consolidation method permitted under IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures.
The Groups Balance Sheet includes its share of the assets and liabilities of the joint venture entity and the Groups Statement of Comprehensive Income includes its share of the entitys income and expenditure.
The profit or loss arising on transactions with the joint venture entity are recognised only to the extent of that attributable to the interest of the other joint venture party unless any loss represents a permanent impairment loss, in which case it is provided in full.
In the Companys Balance Sheet, investments in joint ventures are stated at cost less any provisions for permanent impairment loss.
Amounts capitalised comprise costs incurred which are directly attributable to the formation of a specific joint venture entity.
ACQUISITIONS Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions and there are no significant assets, other than investment property and liabilities, and without a business being acquired, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In all other cases, the acquisition is treated as a business combination.
INVESTMENT PROPERTIES Investment properties are properties owned or leased by the Group which are held to generate rental income or long term capital appreciation or both.
All of the Groups leases to its tenants fall within the definition of operating leases, as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group as lessor.
Investment properties are initially recognised on acquisition at cost, including related acquisition costs and are revalued semiannually to reflect Fair Value.
Fair Value is determined either by external professional valuers or by the directors in the case of properties sold shortly after the period end.
The Fair Value as determined by the valuers is reduced for any unamortised lease incentives held at the Balance Sheet date.
SHAFTESBURY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 page 77 notes to the financial statements notes to the financial statements continued In the case of investment properties which are leasehold interests, such leases are accounted for as head leases and recognised as an asset and an obligation to pay future minimum lease payments.
The investment property asset is held in the Balance Sheet at Fair Value, gross of the head lease liability.
Lease payments are allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant period rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investment properties are included in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the accounting period in which they arise.
Depreciation is not provided in respect of investment properties or any plant or equipment.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
Expenditure is classified as capital when it results in identifiable future economic benefits which are expected to accrue to the Group.
All other property expenditure is written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Amounts received by way of dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the Group has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements on the date at which there is a legally binding and unconditional contract.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value based on market prices, estimated future cash flows and forward interest rates.
Movements in fair value are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income within net finance costs.
Amounts payable or receivable under such arrangements are included within finance costs or income, recognised on an accruals basis.
BORROWINGS AND COSTS OF RAISING FINANCE Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Expenses and discounts relating to the issue of long term debt are deducted from the proceeds and written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective yield method.
Any premium arising on the issue of long term debt is added to the proceeds and credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income over the life of the debt instrument using an effective interest rate method.
The costs of arranging long and medium term bank facilities are written off in the Statement of Comprehensive Income at a rate which results in a constant charge over the unexpired term of the facilities.
TRADE RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES Trade receivables and trade payables are recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost.
In the case of trade receivables a provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on-demand bank deposits.
Where such deposits can be offset against any amounts owing to the same bank in accordance with its loan agreement, and in the event of settlement the Group intends to settle as a net liability, they are deducted from that loan liability.
ORDINARY SHARES Ordinary shares are classified as equity when there is no obligation to transfer cash or other assets.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from retained earnings.
REVENUE Revenue comprises rents receivable from tenants under operating leases recognised on an accruals basis, lease incentives and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants.
Rents are recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Value added tax is excluded from all amounts.
Income arising as a result of rent reviews is recognised when agreement of new terms is reasonably certain.
Premiums receivable from tenants to surrender their lease obligations are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a capital project in which case they are deducted from project costs.
The cost of any incentives given to lessees to enter into leases is spread over the period from the lease commencement date to its expiry date or to the date of the first break on a straight-line basis.
Lease incentives are usually in the form of rent free periods.
PROPERTY CHARGES Irrecoverable operating costs attributable to properties are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when they arise.
Premiums payable to tenants in connection with the surrender of their lease obligations are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, unless they arise in connection with a capital project in which case they are capitalised.
page 78 SHAFTESBURY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 notes to the financial statements OVERVIEW PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL S FINANCIAL ST TA ATEMENTS TEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION notes to the financial statements continued EMPLOYEE BENEFITS i Share based remuneration The cost of granting share options and other share based remuneration to employees is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income based on the fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is calculated using an option pricing model and charged over the relevant vesting period.
At the end of each reporting period, the directors review their estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The amount charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share based payments reserve.
Following the exercise of share options, the charges previously recognised in respect of these options are released from the share based payments reserve to retained earnings.
ii Pension contributions Payments to defined contribution plans are charged as an expense to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as they fall due.
LEASES i The Group as a lessor Operating leases - all of the Groups leases to its tenants fall within the definition of operating leases, as substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the Group.
Long leaseholds - the Group grants residential long leaseholds to tenants.
As substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the tenant the property is not recognised as an investment property.
ii The Group as a lessee Operating leases - the lease under which the Group occupies office accommodation for its own administration is accounted for as an operating lease, with rents payable charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Head leases - where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group they are accounted for as head leases.
Head leases are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of the Fair Value of the property and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to the long-term liabilities.
On payment of ground rent all of the cost is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
CURRENT AND DEFERRED CORPORATION TAX The tax expense or credit in a given year comprises current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the corporation tax payable on taxable income for the current year adjusted for prior years under or over provisions.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of all temporary timing differences between the values at which assets and liabilities are recorded in the financial statements and their base cost for corporation tax purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income unless the items to which it relates have been accounted for in equity, in which case the related deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
In the case of deferred tax in relation to investment property revaluation surpluses, the base cost used is historical book cost and ignores any allowances or deductions which may be available to reduce the actual tax liability which would crystallise in the event of a disposal of the asset.
The Group expects to recover the value of its investment property assets through future rental income streams.
Deferred tax liabilities or assets are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax balance is realised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and the allocation of resources.
The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
SHAFTESBURY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 page 79 notes to the financial statements notes to the financial statements continued For the purposes of IFRS 8, each village is considered to be a separate operating segment.
However, in view of the similar characteristics of each village, and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable operating segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable operating segment using measures of net property income and investment property valuation.
All financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements and, as the Group has only one reportable segment, the measures used in assessing the business are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps.
The weighted average maturity of the swaps at the Balance Sheet date is set out in note 21.
The 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 and the Groups share of its joint ventures 4.43% secured term loan are held at amortised cost in the Balance Sheet.
The fair value of liability in excess of book value which is not recognised in the reported results for the year is 18.5 million 2011: 11.4 million.
The fair values have been calculated based on a discounted cash flow model using the relevant reference gilt and appropriate market spread.
The Company is not obliged to redeem the 61.0 million nominal of Debenture Stock in issue in advance of its redemption date of 31 March 2024, when repayment will be at par value.
The Company also has no obligation to repay its share of the secured term loan in advance of its maturity on 21 December 2026.
The Groups interest rate swaps and Debenture are fair valued by J. C. Rathbone Associates Limited and the secured term loan is valued by the directors, using the following fair value hierarchy: Hierarchy Description Instrument Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the Interest rate swaps asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, Debentures and secured term unobservable inputs.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine fair values of loan these instruments.
Other financial instruments The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings other than the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024 and its share of the secured term loan, head leases and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.

MANAGEMENT OF FINANCIAL RISK CREDIT RISK Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 18.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups bankers are set out on page ??.
The Group tends to hold minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day to day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Finance Report on pages 34 to 36.
SHAFTESBURY PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2012 page 92 notes to the financial statements OVERVIEW PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL S FINANCIAL ST TA ATEMENTS TEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION notes to the financial statements continued MARKET RISK Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long-term fixed rate debt, long-term committed bank facilities and the use of long-term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Finance Report on pages 34 to 36, the Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
Details of the Groups interest and hedging arrangements are set out in note 21.
INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates on its unhedged LIBOR-linked borrowings and a change in the long-term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated at the Balance Sheet date.
It represents the directors assessment of possible changes in interest rates and the potential impacts on the Groups results and equity.

CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposits.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings is set out in note 21 and the Groups equity structure is set out in the Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity.
The Groups capital management objectives are to continue as a going concern and to provide enhanced shareholder returns whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The Groups capital structure such as levels of gearing and loan-to-value ratios are discussed in the Finance Report on pages 34 to 36.

RESERVES The Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity is set out on page 75.
The following describes the nature and purpose of each of the reserves within shareholders equity.
Reserve Description and purpose Merger reserve The merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received from ordinary shares exceeds the nominal value of shares issued, net of expenses.
Share based payments The share based payment expense charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the reserve share based payments reserve over the vesting period of performance-based shares options.
Upon exercise of options, the expense previously recognised is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings Cumulative gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transfers from the share based payments reserve and merger reserve are also credited to this account.
The Companys retained earnings at 30 September 2012 include amounts distributable of 250.2 million 2011: 250.1 million.

SHARE BASED REMUNERATION The fair value of option grants is measured by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Actuaries & Consultants, using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and modified binomial models, and taking into account the terms and conditions upon which awards were granted.
The fair value is recognised over the expected vesting period.
For the grants made during the year, the main inputs and assumptions of the models, and the resulting fair values, are as follows: LTIP LTIP Grant date 7 December 2011 17 January 2012 Share price at date of grant 4.86 4.79 Exercise price Nil Nil Expected life years 33 Performance condition NAV and TSR NAV and TSR Assumed return volatility per annum 37% 36% Assumed dividend yield per annum 2.31% 2.35% Risk free discount rate per annum 0.41% 0.49% Assumed index return volatility - TSR performance condition 35% 35% Assumed correlation between the Companys shares and those in the index 0.79 0.85 Basis of option pricing: NAV performance condition Modified binomial Modified binomial TSR performance condition Monte Carlo Monte Carlo Fair values: NAV 4.54 4.46 TSR 2.82 2.89 The index is the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index.
