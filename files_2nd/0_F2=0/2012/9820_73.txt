For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Underlying earnings per share gures are presented to exclude the effect of exceptional items.
The Directors consider that the supplementary gures are a useful indicator of performance.
