Performance summary Business description Business review Governance Financial statements Additional information b Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk, arising principally on changes in US dollar, euro and sterling interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to floating rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing fixed and floating rate borrowing and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate derivatives.
These practices aim to minimise the groups net finance charges with acceptable year on year volatility.
To facilitate operational efficiency and effective hedge accounting, the groups policy is to maintain fixed rate borrowings within a band of 40% to 60% of forecast net borrowings.
Due to the exceptionally low interest rate environment experienced during 2012, the board has approved an exception to this policy, permitting fixed rate debt to reach up to 100% of forecast net debt.
For these calculations, net borrowings exclude interest rate related fair value adjustments.
The majority of Diageos existing interest rate derivatives are legacy fair value hedges that have locked in positive market values.
These instruments are no longer involved in hedge relationships and the fair value change is recognised in the income statement which is partially offset by the net interest earned on these derivatives.
c Commodity price risk The group is exposed to commodity price risk.
Commodity price risk is managed in line with principles approved by the board either through long term purchase contracts with suppliers or, where appropriate, derivative contracts.
Where derivative contracts are used the group manages exposures principally through exchange-traded futures, forwards, swaps and options.
d Market risk sensitivity analysis The group is using a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated impacts on the consolidated income statement and other comprehensive income of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 0.5% 50 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies, from the rates applicable at 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011, for each class of financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on the net post employment benefit liability and corporate tax payable.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice interest and foreign exchange rates rarely change in isolation.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the following: r 'JOBODJBM JOTUSVNFOUT BSF WBMVFE BU UIF CBMBODF TIFFU EBUF VTJOH EJTDPVOUFE DBTI PX UFDIOJRVFT r $IBOHFT JO JOUFSFTU SBUFT BFDU UIF JOUFSFTU JODPNF PS FYQFOTF PG WBSJBCMF JOUFSFTU OBODJBM JOTUSVNFOUT r $IBOHFT JO JOUFSFTU SBUFT POMZ BFDU JOUFSFTU JODPNF PS FYQFOTF JO SFMBUJPO UP OBODJBM JOTUSVNFOUT XJUI YFE JOUFSFTU SBUFT if these are recognised at fair value.

Actual results in the future may differ from these results materially due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered as projections of likely future events, gains or losses.
Reasonably possible hypothetical changes in other risk variables would not significantly affect the fair value of financial instruments at 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011.
