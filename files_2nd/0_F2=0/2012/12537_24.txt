72 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements REMUNERATION REPORT continued Pension schemes The company operates a group personal pension plan in the UK together with a funded, registered, defined benefit pension scheme, the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme which was closed to new members in 1997.
The Scheme provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation, or five per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
In the Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2012, this was set at 129,600, and will increase to 137,400 for the year to 31 December 2013.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the cap.
The value of this target pension provision is made available at each directors option in the form of an enhanced level of pension contributions and or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
Regular reviews are carried out to assess the extent to which the payments already made to each director are projected to be sufficient to provide the accrued component of their target pension: where such reviews indicate a shortfall, the company provides an additional, non-pensionable target funding payment.
In respect of 2012, Messrs A R C Durrant and N Hawkings elected to receive a salary supplement, whilst Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and A G Lodge elected to receive a combination of pension contributions and a salary supplement.
