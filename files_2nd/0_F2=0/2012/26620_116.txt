The aim of the prize, which receives worldwide press attention, is to promote excellence in fiction by recognising the best full-length novel the annual Man Booker Prize for Fiction published by a citizen of the Commonwealth, or the Republic of Ireland, in and the biennial Man Booker the year of the prize.
The novel must be an original, non-self published, work in English.
Winning the Man Booker Prize is considered the ultimate accolade bymany writers.
As former prize-winner Graham Swift commented: Prizes dont make writers and writers dont write to win prizes, but in the near-glut of literary awards now on offer its the one which, if were completely honest, we most covet.
Last years winner, Hilary Mantel for Bring Up the Bodies, made Man Booker history as the first woman and the first Briton to receive the prize twice, having also won for Wolf Hall in 2009.
Receiving the prize, Mantel joked: You wait 20 years for a prize and then two come along at once.
The pressure is certainly on for the third instalment of the trilogy charting the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell.
The Man Booker International prize is awarded every two years to a living author who has published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in translation in English.
It differs from the annual Man Booker Prize in that it highlights one writers overall contribution to fiction on the world stage, rather than a single work.
The 2011 prize went to US author Philip Roth.
The 2013 prize will be awarded in May.
