notes to the financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation Burberry Group plc and its subsidiaries the Group is a global luxury goods manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer.
The Group also licenses third parties to manufacture and distribute products using the Burberry trade marks.
All of the companies which comprise the Group are owned by Burberry Group plc the Company directly or indirectly.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
There have been no new standards, amendments and interpretations issued and made effective for the financial period commencing on 1 April 2011 that have had a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
As at 31 March 2012, the following new and revised standards, amendments and interpretations, which may be relevant to the Groups results, were issued but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial instruments This standard is the first step in the process to replace IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement, and introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU.
Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer to the date of adoption.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements This standard establishes the principles for the presentation and preparation of consolidated financial statements and replaces similar principles set out in IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements.
The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 and has not currently been endorsed by the EU.
Any potential impact of this new standard will be quantified closer to the date of adoption, but it is not considered likely to have a material impact.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 11 updates the approach currently set out in IAS 28 Investments in associates by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement rather than its legal form.
The adoption of this new standard is not considered likely to have a material impact on the financial position or financial performance of the Group.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities This standard requires disclosure of information about the nature of, and risks associated with, the Groups interests in other entities, as well as the impact of these interests on the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
Any potential impact of this new standard will be limited to disclosure which will be assessed closer to the date of adoption.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement This standard aims to provide a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to be used across all IFRSs.
Basis of consolidation The Groups annual financial statements comprise those of Burberry Group plc the parent Company and its subsidiaries, presented as a single economic entity.
The results of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies across the Group.
Subsidiaries are all entities including special purpose entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
Where there is a loss of control of a subsidiary, the consolidated financial statements include the results for the portion of the reporting period during which the Group had control.
Intra-group transactions, balances and unrealised profits on transactions between Group companies are eliminated in preparing the Group financial statements.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 101 Notes to the financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation continued Key sources of estimation and judgement Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires that management make certain judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimate and assumptions will be updated as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas where the estimates and assumptions applied have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Refer to note 10 for further details of goodwill balances.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Refer to note 11 for further details of property, plant and equipment.
Income and deferred taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory.
There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions and assets in the period in which such determination is made.
Refer to notes 7 and 13 for further details of income and deferred tax balances.
Put option liability over non-controlling interest The calculation of the fair value of the put option over the non-controlling interest in the Groups business in China is based on the contractual agreement and requires the application of key assumptions around both the future performance of the Groups business in China and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise and the risk free rate in China.
Refer to notes 18 and 24 for further details of the put option liability.
Inventory provisioning The Group manufactures and sells luxury goods and is subject to changing consumer demands and fashion trends.
As a result it is necessary to consider the recoverability of the cost of inventories and the associated provisioning required.
When calculating the inventory provision, management considers the nature and condition of the inventory, as well as applying assumptions around anticipated saleability.
Refer to note 15 for further details of the carrying value of inventory.
Impairment of trade receivables The Group is required to make an estimate of the recoverable value of trade receivables.
When assessing impairment of trade receivables, management considers factors including the ageing profile of debtors as well as any specific known problems or risks.
Given global economic conditions and the range of countries the Group trades in, unanticipated future events may occur that could impact the appropriateness of the assessment made as to the recoverability of the Groups trade receivables.
Refer to notes 14 and 24 for further details on the net carrying value and credit quality of trade receivables.
102 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies The principal accounting policies of the Group are: a Revenue Revenue, which is stated excluding Value Added Tax and other sales related taxes, is the amount receivable for goods supplied less returns, trade discounts and allowances and royalties receivable.
Wholesale sales are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer, with provisions made for expected returns and allowances.
Retail sales, returns and allowances are reflected at the dates of transactions with customers.
Provisions for returns on retail and wholesale sales are calculated based on historical return levels.
Royalties receivable from licensees are accrued as earned on the basis of the terms of the relevant royalty agreement, which is typically on the basis of production volumes.
In arrangements where the Group acts as a purchasing agent to facilitate the procurement of Burberry branded products on behalf of its licensees, the purchases and sales from the supplier to the licensee are not recorded as transactions by the Group.
Any costs incurred by the Group are recorded as operating expenses and any agency fees receivable are recorded as operating income.
b Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
c Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Contingent payments are remeasured at fair value through the Income Statement.
All transaction costs are expensed to the Income Statement.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the Income Statement.
d Share schemes The cost of the share based incentives received by employees including executive directors is measured with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments awarded at the date of grant.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model is used to determine the fair value of the award made.
The impact of performance conditions is not considered in determining the fair value on the date of grant, except for conditions linked to the price of Burberry Group plc shares i. e. market conditions.
Vesting conditions which relate to non-market conditions are allowed for in the assumptions used for the number of options expected to vest.
The estimate of the number of options expected to vest is revised at each balance sheet date.
The cost of the share based incentives is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the awards, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The proceeds received from the exercise of the equity instruments awarded, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital and share premium.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 103 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued e Leases The Group is both a lessor and lessee of property, plant and equipment.
Determining whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement.
Leases in which substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Gross rental expenditure income in respect of operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the leases.
Certain rental expenses are determined on the basis of revenue achieved in specific retail locations and are accrued for on that basis.
Amounts paid to received from the landlord to acquire or transfer the rights to a lease are treated as prepayments accrued income on the lease contract.
Lease incentives, typically rent free periods and capital contributions, are held on the Balance Sheet in accruals and deferred income and recognised over the term of the lease.
Finance leases where the Group is a lessee are capitalised at the commencement of the lease at the lower of fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Interest is charged to the Income Statement and credited to the lease liability using the effective interest rate method.
Lease liabilities are held in other creditors on the Balance Sheet.
The capitalised leased assets are held in property, plant and equipment on the Balance Sheet, and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the useful life of the leased asset.
f Dividend distributions Dividend distributions to Burberry Group plcs shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividend becomes a committed obligation.
Final dividends are recognised when they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
g Pension costs Defined contribution schemes Eligible employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, the principal one being in the UK with its assets held in an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benefits to participating employees is recognised in the Income Statement and comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Defined benefit schemes Eligible employees of the Group participate in defined benefit schemes in France and Taiwan.
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit schemes represents the Groups share of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the Projected Unit Credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
h Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill on acquisition is recorded as an intangible fixed asset.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are also made to align the accounting policies of acquired businesses with those of the Group.
Goodwill is assigned an indefinite useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are performed annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment losses recognised on goodwill are not reversed in future periods.
Trade marks and other intangible assets The cost of securing and renewing trade marks and the cost of acquiring other intangible assets such as key money is capitalised at purchase price and amortised by equal annual instalments over the period in which benefits are expected to accrue, typically ten years for trade marks, or the term of the lease.
The useful economic life of trade marks and other intangible assets is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreement and the nature of the asset.
Computer software The cost of acquiring computer software including licences and separately identifiable external development costs is capitalised as an intangible asset at purchase price, plus any directly attributable cost of preparing that asset for its intended use.
Software costs are amortised by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives, which are up to five years.
104 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued i Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, with the exception of assets under the course of construction, is stated at cost or deemed cost, based on historical revalued amounts, less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.
Assets in the course of construction are stated at cost less any provision for impairment and transferred to completed assets when substantially all of the activities necessary for the asset to be ready for use have occurred.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated to write off the cost or deemed cost, less residual value, of the assets in equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Land Not depreciated Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leaseholds less than 50 years expired Over the unexpired term of the lease Plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 3 8 years Retail fixtures and fittings 2 5 years Office equipment 5 years Computer equipment Up to 5 years Assets in the course of construction Not depreciated Profit loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment Profits and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and net book value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when the relevant transaction becomes unconditional.
j Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful economic life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
k Investment properties Investment properties are freehold properties held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision to reflect any impairment in value.
Cost includes the original purchase price plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Investment properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of up to 50 years.
l Discontinued operations and assets classified as held for sale A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of, has been abandoned or meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale.
Discontinued operations are presented on the Income Statement as a separate line and are shown net of tax.
Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continued use, and a sale within the next twelve months is considered to be highly probable.
Assets classified as held for sale cease to be depreciated and they are stated as the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 105 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued m Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued on a first-in-first-out basis at the lower of cost including an appropriate proportion of production overhead and net realisable value.
Where necessary, provision is made to reduce cost to no more than net realisable value having regard to the nature and condition of inventory, as well as its anticipated saleability.
n Taxation Tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense which are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items which are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the temporary difference arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, no deferred tax will be recognised.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
o Provisions Provisions are recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
When the effect of the time value of money is material, provision amounts are calculated based on the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
The present value is calculated using forward market interest rates as measured at the balance sheet reporting date, which have been adjusted for risks reflected in future cash flow estimates.
Property obligations A provision for the present value of future property reinstatement costs is recognised where there is an obligation to return the leased property to its original condition at the end of an operating lease.
Where a leased property is no longer expected to be fully occupied or where the costs exceed the future expected benefits, an onerous lease provision will be recognised for that portion of the lease excess to the Groups requirements and not fully recovered through sub-leasing, or through value-in-use.
Restructuring costs Provisions for costs associated with restructuring programmes are recognised when a detailed formal restructuring plan has been approved and communicated.
Examples of restructuring related costs include employee termination payments, contract termination penalties and onerous contract payments.
p Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
106 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued q Financial instruments A financial instrument is initially recognised at fair value on the Balance Sheet when the entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial asset is derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flow expire or substantially all risks and rewards of the asset are transferred.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method except for derivatives, which are classified as held for trading, except where they qualify for hedge accounting and are held at fair value.
Financial liabilities held at amortised cost include trade payables, accruals and borrowings.
The Group classifies its instruments in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Derivatives are classified as held for trading, unless in a hedging relationship, and are held at fair value.
Financial instrument category Note Classification Measurement Cash and cash equivalents 17 Loans and receivables Amortised cost Trade and other receivables 14 Loans and receivables Amortised cost Trade and other payables 18 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost Borrowings 20 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost Put option over non-controlling interest 18 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss 1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 16 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss Equity swap contracts 16 Derivative instrument Fair value through profit and loss Onerous lease 19 Other financial liabilities Amortised cost 1 Hedge accounting is applied to cash flow hedges to the extent it is achievable.
The Groups primary categories of financial instruments are listed below: Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months or less, held with banks and liquidity funds.
Bank overdrafts are recorded under current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are included in current assets, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except for maturities greater than twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, inclusive of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost and the difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
Put option liabilities over non-controlling interest Put options over shares in subsidiaries held by non-controlling interests are recognised initially at fair value through equity when granted.
They are subsequently re-measured at fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in the Income Statement as other finance expenses and income.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 107 Notes to the financial statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued q Financial instruments continued Derivative instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates arising on certain trading transactions.
The principal derivative instruments used are forward foreign exchange contracts taken out to hedge highly probable cash flows in relation to future sales, royalty receivables and product purchases.
To manage interest rate risk the Group manages its proportion of fixed and floating rate borrowings to within limits approved by the Board using interest rate swap derivatives.
It designates foreign currency borrowings in a net investment hedge of the assets of overseas subsidiaries.
When hedge accounting is applied the Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : or 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges : or 3 classified as held for trading.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the Income Statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is deferred in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Amounts deferred in other comprehensive income are recycled in the Income Statement in the periods when the hedged item affects the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the Income Statement within other gains losses - net.
If a derivative instrument is not designated as a hedge, the subsequent change to the fair value is recognised in the Income Statement within operating expenses or interest depending upon the nature of the instrument.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign operations through foreign currency borrowings, the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in other comprehensive income and will be reclassified to the Income Statement when the foreign operation that was hedged is disposed of.

Accounting policies continued r Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies within each entity in the Group are translated into the functional currency at the monthly average exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, which are held at the year end, are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise, except where these exchange differences form part of a net investment in overseas subsidiaries of the Group, in which case such differences are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Translation of the results of overseas businesses The results of overseas subsidiaries are translated into the Groups presentation currency of Sterling each month at the weighted average exchange rate for the month according to the phasing of the Groups trading results.
The weighted average exchange rate is used, as it is considered to approximate the actual exchange rates on the date of the transactions.
The assets and liabilities of such undertakings are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies, and on the translation of their results, are taken directly to the foreign currency translation reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate.
The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Average rate Closing rate Year to Year to As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 Euro 1.16 1.18 1.20 1.13 US Dollar 1.60 1.56 1.60 1.61 Chinese Yuan Renminbi 10.15 10.51 10.07 10.52 Hong Kong Dollar 12.38 12.11 12.41 12.49 Korean Won 1,775 1,786 1,811 1,763 The average exchange rate achieved by the Group on its Yen royalty income, taking into account its use of Yen forward foreign exchange contracts on a monthly basis approximately twelve months in advance of royalty receipts, was Yen 133.1: 1 in the year to 31 March 2012 2011: Yen 143.7: 1. s Adjusted profit before taxation and exceptional items Exceptional items include those items that are largely one-off and material in nature.
The Group presents these items in note 5 to the accounts in profit before taxation.
Fair value movements on options held over equity interests, which are held for the purpose of future business developments, rather than speculative purposes, are also considered to be exceptional items and are separately presented in the Income Statement.
These items are added back deducted from profit loss before taxation to arrive at adjusted profit loss before taxation.
These items and their related tax impacts are added back deducted from profit attributable to equity holders of the Company to arrive at adjusted earnings per share.
These measures are disclosed in order to provide additional consideration of the underlying performance of the Groups ongoing business.

Segmental analysis The Chief Operating Decision Maker has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports used by the Board.
The Board considers Burberrys business through its two channels to market, being Retail Wholesale and Licensing.
Retail Wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of luxury goods through Burberry mainline stores, concessions, outlets and digital commerce as well as Burberry franchisees, prestige department stores globally and multi-brand specialty accounts.
The flow of global product between Retail and Wholesale channels and across our regions is monitored and optimised at a corporate level and implemented via the Groups inventory hubs situated in Asia, Europe and the US.
Licensing revenues are generated through the receipt of royalties from Burberrys partners in Japan and global licensees of fragrances, eyewear, timepieces and European childrenswear.
The Board assesses channel performance based on a measure of adjusted operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items.
The measure of earnings for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board includes an allocation of corporate and central costs.
Interest income and charges are not included in the result for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Board.

Intangible assets continued Impairment testing of goodwill The carrying value of the goodwill allocated to cash generating units: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m China 41.9 38.9 Korea 22.8 23.4 Other 16.5 10.8 Total 81.2 73.1 The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually or where there is an indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of all cash generating units has been determined on a value-in-use basis.
Value-in-use calculations for each cash generating unit are based on projected three year pre-tax discounted cash flows together with a discounted terminal value.
The cash flows have been discounted at pre-tax rates reflecting the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country specific tax rates and risks.
Where the cash generating unit has a non-controlling interest which was recognised as its proportionate interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date, the carrying amount of the goodwill has been grossed up, to include the goodwill attributable to the non-controlling interest, for the purpose of impairment testing the goodwill attributable to the cash generating unit.
The key assumptions contained in the value-in-use calculations include the future revenues, the margins achieved, the assumed life of the business and the discount rates applied.
The value-in-use calculations for the initial review have been prepared using managements approved financial plans for the year ending 31 March 2013 as the source for the first year cash flow.
These plans contain managements best view of the expected performance for the year ended 31 March 2013, based on the performance achieved in the current year and managements knowledge of the market environment and future business plans.
In China and Korea, which contain the most material goodwill balances, the cash flows included in the value-in-use calculation for the following two years and for the terminal value have assumed no growth beyond that contained within the financial plan for the year ending 31 March 2013.
The Group carries out an initial review for indication of impairment using conservative growth assumptions beyond the first year cash flow.
Should this initial review indicate that impairment may have arisen, a further review will be carried out, using more detailed assumptions, to confirm and then quantify any potential impairment.
This approach is considered appropriate by management due to the amount of headroom between recoverable amount and carrying value of goodwill at present.
The adjusted weighted average cost of capital rates for China and Korea were 14.4% and 12.5% respectively 2011: 13.5%: 14.1%.
No impairment has been recognised in respect of the carrying value of the goodwill balance in the year as, for each cash generating unit, the recoverable amount of goodwill exceeds its carrying value.
As the initial review using conservative assumptions does not indicate that impairment may have arisen, management do not consider it appropriate to conduct a further sensitivity analysis because a reasonably possible change in assumptions would not result in an impairment.

2 During the current year, 18.6m of assets have been reclassified from fixtures and fittings to leasehold improvements as this is more representative of the nature of these assets.
There is no impact on the depreciation charge for the year as a result of this reclassification.
During the year to 31 March 2012, a net impairment charge of 3.8m 2011: nil was identified as part of the annual impairment review.
Where indicators of impairment were identified, the impairment review compared the value-in-use of the assets to the carrying values at 31 March 2012.
The pre-tax cash flow projections were based on financial plans approved by management and extrapolated beyond the budget year to the lease exit dates using growth rates and inflation rates appropriate to each countrys economic conditions.
The pre-tax discount rates used in these calculations were between 10.8% and 16.7% 2011: between 12.2% and 18.5%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for country-specific tax rates and risks.

Derivative financial instruments The Group Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts.
These transactions are recorded as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow hedges The Groups foreign currency denominated transactions arise principally from royalty income, sales and purchases.
The Group manages these exposures through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.

Put and call options exist over this interest stake which are exercisable after 5 years from acquisition date in the case of the call option, and 10 years from acquisition date in the case of the put option.
The net present value of the put option has been recognised as a non-current financial liability under IAS 39.
The key assumptions in arriving at the fair value of the put option are the future performance of both the Groups business in China and the future performance of the Group, the Burberry Group plc market capitalisation at the date of exercise and the risk free rate in China.
The maturity of the other non-current creditors, accruals and deferred income, all of which do not bear interest, is as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Between one and two years 3.7 3.2 Between two and three years 3.8 3.3 Between three and four years 1.8 2.5 Between four and five years 4.3 2.7 Over five years 33.5 25.4 Total 47.1 37.1 The fair value of trade and other payables approximate their carrying amounts and are unsecured.

Financial commitments The Group leases various retail stores, offices, warehouses and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
The leases have varying terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
The Group has commitments relating to future minimum lease payments under these non-cancellable operating leases as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Amounts falling due: Within one year 118.6 94.6 Between two and five years 330.6 244.5 After five years 191.1 196.2 Total 640.3 535.3 The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of revenue revenue leases have been based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease.
Under certain revenue leases, there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above.
As a result, the amounts charged to the Income Statement may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.
The total of future minimum payments to be received under non-cancellable leases on investment properties and subleases on land and buildings is as follows: Leases Subleases As at As at As at As at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Amounts falling due: Within one year 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.8 Between two and five years 2.8 2.9 1.6 2.3 After five years 2.0 2.8 0.4 0.4 Total 5.5 6.4 2.7 3.5 23.

Financial risk management Other than derivatives, the Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, external borrowings, trade receivables, and trade and other payables arising directly from operations.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks including foreign exchange risk, share price risk and interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
Risk management is carried out by Group Treasury to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably.
This is done in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
The policies of the Group treasury department are reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
The Groups Income Statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, the Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward foreign exchange contracts see note 16.
The Groups accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments is set out in note 2.
The Groups treasury risk management policy is to hedge anticipated cash flows in each major foreign currency that qualify as highly probable forecast transactions for hedge accounting purposes within the current or previous year.
The Group monitors the desirability of hedging the net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose within the current or previous year.
At 31 March 2012, the Group has performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of non-Sterling currencies strengthening weakening by 20% 2011: 20% against Sterling with all other variables held constant.
The effect on translating foreign currency denominated net debt, receivables, payables and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss would have been to increase decrease post-tax profit for the year by 3.0m 2011: decrease increase 0.1m.
The effect on translating forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and Sterling denominated loans held in overseas subsidiaries would have been to increase decrease equity by 12.1m 2011: 11.4m.
The following table shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities at the year end in currencies other than the local currency of operation, after accounting for the effect of any specific forward foreign exchange contracts used to manage currency exposure.
Monetary assets and liabilities refer to cash, deposits, borrowings and amounts to be received or paid in cash.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are recognised in the Income Statement.
Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities held in currencies other than the local currency of operation: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Sterling 0.3 US Dollar 4.4 0.7 Euro 27.6 1.5 Other currencies 0.5 0.3 Total 22.7 0.8 128 Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 Notes to the financial statements continued 24.
Financial risk management continued Share price risk The Group is exposed to employers national insurance liability due to the implementation of various employee share based incentive schemes.
To reduce exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability due to movements in the Groups share price, the Group has a policy of entering into equity swaps at the time of granting share options and awards.
The Group does not seek hedge accounting treatment for equity swaps.
The Group monitors its exposure to fluctuations in the employers national insurance liability on an ongoing basis.
An increase decrease in the share price of 50.0p would have resulted in an increase decrease in profit after tax of 0.8m.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to cash, short-term deposits and external borrowings.
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short-term borrowings are affected by local market rates around the Group.
The borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group has no outstanding interest rate swaps at 31 March 2012.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups floating rate financial liabilities by currency is as follows: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Sterling 0.2 Other currencies 3.9 2.1 Total financial liabilities 3.9 2.3 The floating rate financial liabilities at 31 March 2012 and 2011 exclude cash pool overdraft balances of 204.7m 2011: 166.1m which are offset by cash balances for the purpose of interest calculations.
At 31 March 2012, if interest rates on borrowings had been 100 basis points higher lower 2011: 200 basis points with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been nil 2011: nil lower higher, as a result of higher lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings.
The fixed rate financial liabilities consist of amounts owed under a finance lease of 1.8m 2011: 2.3m.
The floating rate financial assets, being short-term deposits, are 284.3m as at 31 March 2012 2011: 231.2m.
At 31 March 2012, if interest rates on short-term deposits had been 100 basis points higher lower 2011: 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 2.8m 2011: 2.3m higher lower, as a result of higher lower interest income on short-term deposits.
The Group has no other significant floating rate foreign currency borrowings and therefore is not exposed to movements in foreign currency interest rates.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The trade receivables balance is spread across a large number of different customers with no single debtor representing more than 8% of the total balance due.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant and default rates have historically been very low.
An ageing of overdue receivables is included in note 14.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure to the Group.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short-term deposits and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counterparty with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution and only deposits funds with independently rated financial institutions with a minimum rating of A.
The Group has deposited 0.2m 2011: 1.1m, CHF 0.3m 2011: CHF 0.3m, BRL 0.6m 2011: BRL 0.6m, INR 0.2m 2011: INR 0.2m and TWD nil 2011: TWD 10.0m which is held as collateral at a number of European banks.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report 2011 12 129 Notes to the financial statements continued 24.
Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Groups financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
For further details of this, see note 20.
All short-term trade creditors, accruals, bank overdrafts and borrowings mature within one year or less.
The carrying value of all financial liabilities due in less than one year is equal to their contractual undiscounted cash flows.
The maturity profile of the contractual undiscounted cash flows of the Groups non-current financial liabilities is as follows: As at As at 31 31 March March 2012 2011 m m In more than one year, but not more than two years 3.8 2.6 In more than two years, but not more than three years 2.7 2.0 In more than three years, but not more than four years 4.2 1.0 In more than four years, but not more than five years 1.2 0.6 In more than five years 184.0 151.2 Total financial liabilities 195.9 157.4 Other non-current financial liabilities relate to lease liabilities, property-related accruals and the put option liability over non-controlling interests.
The put option liability is subject to a contractual cap of 200m.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital defined as net cash plus equity excluding non-controlling interest to ensure that entities in the Group are able to operate as going concerns and optimise returns to shareholders.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had net cash of 338.3m 2011: 297.9m and total equity excluding non-controlling interest of 867.3m 2011: 713.6m.
The Group has access to a facility of 300m which was undrawn at 31 March 2012 and a facility of Yen 145m, of which Yen 100.8m was drawn down at 31 March 2012.
For further details refer to note 20.
Cash is used to fund the continued investment in the Group and growth of the global brand.
It is also used to make routine outflows of capital expenditure, tax and dividends.
The Group's dividend policy sets its payout target as 40% of adjusted diluted EPS.
The Board reviews the Groups dividend policy and funding requirements annually.
The Group is in compliance with the financial and other covenants within its committed bank credit facilities, and has been in compliance throughout the financial year.
Employee costs Staff costs, including the cost of directors, incurred during the year are as shown below.
Directors remuneration, which is separately disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 83 to 92 and forms part of these financial statements, includes the notional gains arising on the exercise of share options and awards but excludes the charge in respect of these share options and awards recognised in the Group Income Statement.

Share options granted to directors and employees The Group has a number of share options and share awards schemes for its directors and employees.
Details of each of these schemes are set out in this note.
The share option and award schemes have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The Senior Executive Restricted Share Plan and the Exceptional Performance Share Plan, both of which have market-based performance conditions attached, have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with a discount applied to this value, based on information obtained by running a Monte Carlo simulation model on the scheme.
Where applicable, equity swaps have been entered into to cover future employers national insurance liability or overseas equivalent that may arise in respect of these schemes refer to note 24.
Savings-Related Share Option Scheme In the financial year ended 31 March 2007, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave offering Burberry Group plc ordinary shares was introduced for employees.
On 24 June 2011, further options were granted under this scheme with a three-year and five-year vesting period offered to employees.
The savings contract commencement date for this grant was 1 September 2011.
These options are exercisable for a period of up to six months from 1 September 2014 and 1 September 2016 for the three-year and five-year schemes respectively, with vesting dependent on continued employment, as well as a saving obligation over the vesting period.
The exercise price for these options is calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding the invitation date.
Three day averages are calculated by taking middle market quotations of a Burberry Group plc share from the London Stock Exchange.
The fair value per option for the grant was determined as 2.85.
The key factors used in determining the fair value were as follows: Share price at contract commencement date 13.83 Exercise price 10.49 Life of award Equivalent to vesting period Dividend yield 2.20% Expected volatility 44.8% Risk free interest rate 1.23% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical annualised standard deviation of the market price of the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted Weighted average Year to average Year to exercise 31 March exercise 31 March price 2012 price 2011 Outstanding at 1 April 430.6p 863,271 383.5p 800,937 Granted during the year 1,049.0p 436,609 557.0p 356,026 Lapsed during the year 550.6p 107,857 424.3p 88,892 Withdrawn during the year 599.0p 16,534 456.2p 48,153 Exercised during the year 408.4p 152,761 472.3p 156,647 Outstanding at 31 March 682.5p 1,022,728 430.6p 863,271 Exercisable at 31 March 399.0p 1,365 505.0p 18,383 The weighted average share price at the respective exercise dates in the year was 13.15 2011: 9.83.
