Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements e Interests in unconsolidated structured entities As noted above, the Group holds financial investments in certain pooled vehicles which are typically sub-funds of umbrella structures.
These sub-funds meet the definition of structured entities under IFRS 10 as voting and similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity.
Decision-making at the sub-fund level is typically restricted to administrative tasks only, and instead it is the voting rights at the umbrella level which determines the control of the sub-funds.
The investments which meet the definition of structured entities are the Groups investments in pooled vehicles liquidity funds and pooled vehicles bonds and LIBOR plus funds, as listed in note 3.2.
The funds under management with each of the fund managers in these pooled vehicles are also included within the same note.
These amounts are recorded within financial assets on the Groups balance sheet.
The maximum exposure to loss from the Groups interests in unconsolidated structured entities is 100% of the funds invested in those entities, should the fair value of the assets held deteriorate to nil.
The Group has provided no financial or other support to any unconsolidated structured entities in the period outside of transactions in the ordinary course of investment management, and has no current intentions to do so.
