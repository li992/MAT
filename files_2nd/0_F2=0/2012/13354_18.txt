The Finance Act 2012 introduced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 and this rate is required to be used in calculating deferred tax provisions at the balance sheet date.
This has resulted in a deferred tax credit in the income statement of 1.4m.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact a further reduction in the main corporation tax rate of 1% reducing the main tax rate to 22% from April 2014.
The future 1% main tax rate reduction is expected to have a proportionally similar impact on the underlying trading tax rate as the current year 2% reduction from the previously announced rate of 25%, however the actual impact will be dependent on the Groups deferred tax position at the time.

50 Annual Report 2012 The Restaurant Group plc Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 10 Intangible assets 000 Cost and carrying amount At 3 January 2011, 1 and 2 January 2012 and 30 December 2012 26,433 Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is subject to a bi-annual impairment review, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Therefore, goodwill arising on acquisition is monitored and an impairment test is carried out which compares the value in use of each cash generating unit CGU to the carrying value.
The goodwill represents amounts arising on the acquisition of Blubeckers Limited and Brunning and Price Limited, which now trade as Pub restaurants.
Value in use calculations are based on cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and three year business plans approved by the Board.
Cash ows are then extrapolated in perpetuity with an annual growth rate of 2%.
Perpetuity is believed to be reasonable due to the significant proportion of freeholds in the estate and the nature of the leasehold properties.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash ow projections is 8.6% 2011: 8.4% which is the rate believed by the Directors to reect the risks associated with the CGU.
Since 1 January 1989 the cumulative amount of goodwill written off against realised reserves is 50.4m 2011: 50.4m.
Records for periods prior to this date are not readily available.

Long-Term Incentive Plan The Group operates the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, details of which are provided in the Directors remuneration report on pages 28 to 33.
Awards under the LTIP are granted to executive Directors and senior management.
Conditional Award share options and Matching Award share options are granted to Directors and selected employees.
In respect of the Matching Award share options, the respective Director or employee is required to acquire a number of shares by a specified date, known as deposited shares, and retain these shares until the Matching Award share options vest, for these Matching Award share options to be valid.
The table below summarises the dates of awards under the LTIP and the dates by which Directors and employees were required to acquire their deposited shares.
Date of Award Date by which Deposited Shares must be acquired 4 March 2010 30 June 2010 16 March 2011 30 June 2011 1 March 2012 30 June 2012 Vesting of share options under the LTIP is dependent on continuing employment or in accordance with good leaver properties as set out in the scheme rules.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise options before the normal period in which they are exercisable.
The Conditional and Matching Awards granted on 5 March 2009 became exercisable on the publication of the 2011 results.
The performance criteria was based on TSR and The Restaurant Group plc was the highest ranked company for TSR in its comparator sector and consequently the award vested in full.
For those awards granted on 4 March 2010 that vest in 2013, the performance criteria were based on TSR and EPS.
For the TSR element of the award, The Restaurant Group plc was the highest ranked company against its comparator group for the second year running and consequently the TSR element of the award will vest in full.
In respect of the EPS element of the award the growth in EPS was between RPI 4% and RPI 10% and 71.9% of this part of the award will vest.
The options from the LTIP scheme will be satisfied through share purchases via a trust.
Options are granted with a xed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the five days prior to invitation.
Employees pay a xed amount from their salary into a savings account each month for the three-year savings period.
At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the funds saved.
If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw their funds saved and the options expire.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group.
In exceptional circumstances, employees may be permitted to exercise these options before the end of the three-year savings period.
Options were valued using the Stochastic share pricing model.

In February 2011, the Directors took advantage of the benign and stable interest rate environment and the Groups falling level of debt, and terminated the Groups remaining interest rate swap for a payment of 0.4m.
This resulted in a 0.2m non-trading credit in the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012.
Management pay rigorous attention to treasury management requirements and continue to: ensure sufficient committed loan facilities are in place to support anticipated business requirements: ensure the Groups debt service will be supported by anticipated cash ows and that covenants will be complied with: and manage interest rate exposure with a combination of oating rate debt and interest rate swaps when deemed appropriate.
The Board closely monitors the Groups treasury strategy and the management of treasury risk.

Interest is payable at oating interest rates which uctuate and are dependent on LIBOR and base rate.
The average weighted year end interest rate for these borrowings was 1.75% 2011: 2.02%.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2012 59 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued In October 2011, the Group agreed a new five year 140m loan facility which replaced the previous 120m facility.
This facility provides the Group with medium-term security of funding, additional capacity to take advantage of business opportunities as they become available and the exibility to optimise the Groups funding structure.
The covenants and obligations of the new facility remain the same as the previous agreement and interest remains payable on the amount drawn down at LIBOR plus mandatory cost and the banks margin, which is dependent on the debt to EBITDA ratio.
As a result of termination of the old loan facility arrangement, the Group recorded a non-trading charge of 0.2m for the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2012.
The Group has a 10m overdraft facility, which is repayable on demand, on which interest is payable at the banks overdraft rate.
At 30 December 2012 the Group has 90.0m of committed borrowing facilities in excess of gross borrowings 1 January 2012: 87.0m and 10.0m of undrawn overdraft 1 January 2012: 10.0m of undrawn overdraft.
The maturity prole of anticipated gross future cash ows, including interest, relating to the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis, are set out below: At 30 December 2012 Trade and other payables Floating Finance excluding tax rate loan lease debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 76,589 19,796 328 96,713 Within two to five years 34,653 1,310 35,963 After five years 11,651 11,651 76,589 54,449 13,289 144,327 Less: Future interest payments 5,596 10,117 15,713 76,589 48,853 3,172 128,614 At 1 January 2012 Trade and other payables Floating Finance excluding tax rate loan lease debt Total 000 000 000 000 Within one year 72,359 18,292 326 90,977 Within two to five years 40,340 1,303 41,643 After five years 11,593 11,593 72,359 58,632 13,222 144,213 Less: Future interest payments 6,797 10,090 16,887 72,359 51,835 3,132 127,326 Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for two years.
The xed rate for the duration of the two years was 2.70%.
On 17 January 2011 the interest rate swap expired.
Effective from 16 January 2009 the Group entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of 20m for three years.
The xed rate for the duration of the three years was 2.975%.
On 9 February 2011 the interest rate swap was terminated on payment of 0.4m.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities At 30 December 2012 and 1 January 2012, the Group had no derivative financial instruments relating to interest rate swaps.
All financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at cost and the Directors consider the carrying value to approximate their fair value.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial losses to the Group.
Counterparties for cash and derivative balances are with large established financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by the financial institutions but does not expect them to fail to meet their obligations.
60 Annual Report 2012 The Restaurant Group plc Introduction Business review Governance Financial statements 23 Financial instruments and derivatives continued As a retail business with trading receipts settled either by cash or credit and debit cards, there is very limited exposure from customer transactions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of retrospective discounts receivable from suppliers but the Directors believe adequate provision has been made in respect of doubtful debts and there are no material amounts past due that have not been provided against.
The Group has an outstanding long-term receivable of 10.4m plus interest due from LV Finance Limited, a subsidiary of the Groups associate company Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited.
This debt is secured on the assets of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, but is subject to a prior ranking behind LV Finance Limiteds bank.
In 2007, following a detailed review of the carrying value of the business including the loan note receivable, the Board made full provision against the loan note due further details are provided in note 12.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
c Liquidity risk The Group has built an appropriate mechanism to manage liquidity risk of the short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
Liquidity risk is managed through the maintenance of adequate cash reserves and bank facility by monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups loan facility, which matures in October 2016 as set out in note a above ensures continuity of funding, provided the Group continues to meet its covenant requirements as detailed in the report of the Directors on pages 16 to 23. d Foreign currency risk The Group is not materially exposed to changes in foreign currency rates and does not use foreign exchange forward contracts.
Following the closure of the Groups three restaurants in Spain in 2011, any transactional or translational exposure to changes in foreign exchange rate is marginal and relates to the outstanding transactions in relation to the termination of the Spanish business.
e Interest rate risk Exposure to interest rate movements has been controlled historically through the use of oating rate debt and interest rate swaps to achieve a balanced interest rate prole.
The Group does not currently have any interest rate swaps in place following the early repayment of the swap scheduled to terminate in 2012, as the reduction in the level of debt combined with current market conditions results in a low level of exposure.
The Groups exposure will continue to be monitored and the use of interest rate swaps may be considered in the future.
24 Lease commitments Future lease payments in respect of finance leases are due as follows: Present value of Minimum lease payments minimum lease payments 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Within one year 328 326 328 326 Within two to five years 1,310 1,303 1,004 998 After five years 11,651 11,593 1,840 1,808 13,289 13,222 Less: Future interest payments 10,117 10,090 Present value of lease obligations 3,172 3,132 3,172 3,132 Analysed as: Amount due for settlement within one year 328 326 Amount due for settlement after one year 2,844 2,806 Present value of lease obligations 3,172 3,132 Lease commitments are in respect of property leases where the initial term of the lease is in excess of 25 years and the conditions of the lease are in keeping with a finance lease.
There are no finance leases where the Group itself is the lessor.
The interest rate applied in calculating the present value of the payments is the incremental borrowing cost of the Group in relation to each lease.
The fair value of the lease payments is estimated as 3.2m 2011: 3.1m.
The Restaurant Group plc Annual Report 2012 61 Notes to the accounts continued 24 Lease commitments continued The total future minimum rentals payable and receivable under operating leases over the remaining lives of the leases are: Payable Receivable Payable Receivable 2012 2012 2011 2011 Payments due: 000 000 000 000 Within one year 53,695 3,101 51,558 3,401 Within two to five years 183,809 9,974 179,517 10,248 After five years 398,112 25,511 384,059 26,673 635,616 38,586 615,134 40,322 The Group has entered into a number of property leases on standard commercial terms, both as lessee and lessor.
There are no restrictions imposed by the Groups operating lease arrangements, either in the current or prior year.
Included within the minimum rentals are amounts payable on properties where the rental payment is based on turnover.
For these properties, primarily in the Groups Concession business, the amount included above is the minimum guaranteed rent as detailed in the concession agreement.
Where there is no minimum guaranteed rent, the amount included is based on the estimated amount payable.
25 Capital commitments 2012 2011 000 000 Authorised and contracted for: 27,015 13,975 26 Contingent liabilities The Group has assigned a number of leases to third parties that were originally completed prior to 1 January 1996 and are therefore unaffected by the Landlord and Tenant Covenants Act 1995 and also a number of leases completed after this date that were the subject of an Authorised Guarantee Agreement.
Consequently, should the current tenant default, the landlord has a right of recourse to The Restaurant Group plc, or its subsidiaries, for future rental payments.
As and when any liability arises, the Group will take whatever steps necessary to mitigate the costs.
27 Related party transactions Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited is a related party to The Restaurant Group plc through the Groups 38% holding.
A loan note of 10.4m is due from LV Finance, a subsidiary of Living Ventures Restaurants Group Limited, which attracts interest at the rate of LIBOR.
During the year ended 30 December 2012, 0.2m of interest accrued of which the Group recognised 0.2m 2011: 0.2m of which the Group recognised 0.1m.
Consequently, in addition to the loan note of 10.4m at that date, 0.1m 2011: 0.5m of interest receivable was still outstanding, of which, under the terms of the agreement, all was overdue.
