Derivatives continued Other derivatives At 31 March 2012, the company held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with FRS 26.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts were hedging the groups bond portfolio but became ineffective on first adoption of FRS 26.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the profit and loss account but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
