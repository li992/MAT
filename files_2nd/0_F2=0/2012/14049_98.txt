At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2012 2011 m m Within one year 110.5 137.0 Between one and five years 189.9 198.3 After five years 133.7 131.2 434.1 466.5 Principal lease commitments are within the UK & Europe segment, with future minimum lease payments totalling 219.6m 2011 restated: 205.3m.
These leases relate primarily to administrative and operational buildings, track and rolling stock within the train operating companies.
The length of the leases is concurrent with the period of the franchises and the terms of the leases are xed during this period.
Share-based payment expense The Group recognised the following expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions: 2012 2011 m m Executive Option Plan 0.1 Long Term Incentive Scheme and Plan 0.8 0.9 Sharesave 0.2 0.7 Transformational Share Scheme 0.1 0.1 Performance Share Plan 9.9 8.5 Deferred Bonus Plan 1.1 0.9 12.1 11.2 Executive Option Plan EOP Options granted under the EOP may be exercised after the third anniversary of grant, dependent upon the achievement of a financial performance target over three years.
The options are granted at market value and awards made to eligible employees are based on between 50% and 100% of salary as at 31 December prior to grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Furthermore, options may be forfeited if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Details of the movement in all EOP options are as follows: Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 2012 2012 2011 2011 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 3,389 2.49 3,957 2.63 Granted during the year Exercised during the year 759 2.29 294 3.37 Lapsed during the year 158 2.22 274 3.62 Outstanding at 31 December 2,472 2.56 3,389 2.49 Of these options 2,471,696 2011: 3,300,690 were exercisable at the end of the year, with a weighted average exercise price of 2.56 2011: 2.34.

Share-based payment expense continued Executive Option Plan EOP continued The exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 December 2012 ranged from 1.39 to 4.55 2011: 1.39 to 4.55.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise approximates to the weighted average share price during the year, which was 5.50 2011: 5.34.
The fair value of options granted under the EOP is measured by use of the Binomial Lattice model.
The Binomial Lattice model is considered to be most appropriate for valuing options granted under this scheme as it allows exercise over a longer period of time between the vesting date and the expiry date.
There were no new options granted under Executive Option Plans during the year.
Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards made to eligible employees under the above schemes are structured as options with a zero exercise price.
The extent to which an award vests and therefore becomes exercisable is measured by reference to the growth in the Groups earnings per share EPS or total shareholder return TSR over the performance period or service period conditions.
Details of the movement in all LTIS and LTIP options are as follows: Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 2012 2012 2011 2011 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 2,638 Nil 3,691 Nil Granted during the year 218 Nil 23 Nil Exercised during the year 247 Nil 411 Nil Lapsed during the year 1,692 Nil 665 Nil Outstanding at 31 December 917 Nil 2,638 Nil Of these options 521,459 2011: 2,169,500 were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2012 had a weighted average contractual life of 3.9 years 2011: 5.8 years.
There were four grants of LTIP options during the year.
The fair value is considered to be their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not paid over the vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under this scheme in the year is 5.25.
Transformational Share Scheme Awards made to eligible employees under the Transformational Share Scheme are structured as options with a nil exercise price and are exercisable after the third anniversary of the grant.
The employee must exercise the options no later than 30 days after the vesting date.
Furthermore, if the eligible employee leaves the Group before the options vest, the options may be forfeited.

Share-based payment expense continued Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, eligible employees have been granted options with an exercise price of two pence.
Awards vest after the performance period of three years and are subject to the achievement of two performance measures.
The primary performance measure is TSR and the second performance measure is based on EPS growth.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2012 had a weighted average contractual life of 8.5 years 2011: 8.7 years.
In the year, four grants were made with 50% of the options granted subject to TSR performance conditions and 50% subject to EPS growth performance conditions.
The options subject to TSR performance conditions were valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation model.
The options subject to EPS growth performance conditions were deemed to have fair values equal to their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
The Monte Carlo Simulation model is considered to be the most appropriate for valuing options granted under schemes where there are changes in performance conditions by which the options are measured, such as for the TSR-based awards.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo Simulation model for options granted during the year with TSR performance conditions are: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price 540p 558p Weighted average exercise price 2p 2p Expected volatility 22.7% 28.1% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 0.3% 1.8% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The assumptions for options granted during the year with EPS growth performance conditions are: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price 540p 558p Weighted average exercise price 2p 2p Expected volatility N A N A Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate N A N A The weighted average fair value of options granted under this scheme in the year is 4.38.

Share-based payment expense continued Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, eligible employees are entitled to use up to 50% of their earned annual bonus to purchase shares in the Group at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for a specified period, the shares are retained for that period and the two performance measures which are the same as the PSP scheme, being TSR and EPS growth have been met, the Group will make a matching share award.
For shares purchased by employees in 2011, the match was on a basis of two times the gross bonus deferred.

In the year, one grant was made with 100% of the deferred bonus subject to EPS growth performance conditions.
The portion subject to EPS growth performance conditions was deemed to have a fair value equal to their face value less the present value of any dividend payments not received over the vesting period.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Share-based payment expense continued Sharesave 2008 The Sharesave 2008 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 10%.
The options can be exercised for a period of six months following their vesting.
Details of the movement in Sharesave 2008 options are as follows: Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average options exercise price options exercise price 2012 2012 2011 2011 Thousands Thousands Outstanding at 1 January 1,108 4.0 5,479 4.0 Granted during the year 4.0 4.0 Exercised during the year 807 4.0 3,981 4.0 Lapsed during the year 301 4.0 390 4.0 Outstanding at 31 December 4.0 1,108 4.0 Of these options none 2011: 1,101,183 were exercisable at the end of the year.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2012 had a weighted average contractual life of nil 2011: 0.2 years.
Given that options granted under the Sharesave scheme can be exercised at any time after vesting, management consider the Binomial Lattice model to be appropriate to value the options granted under this scheme.
The Binomial Lattice model allows exercise over a window in time, from vesting date to expiry date and assumes option holders make economically rational exercise decisions.
Sharesave 2012 The Sharesave 2012 scheme provides for a purchase price equal to the daily average market price on the date of grant less 10%.
