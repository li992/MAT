Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benets.
The Group operates a number of dened benefit schemes and dened contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2012, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, was 112.5m 2011: 112.3m.
30 a Dened benefit schemes The Group operates dened benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and Europe.
In addition, the Group has interests in joint ventures, which operate dened benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the funded schemes are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The Groups major schemes are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.
This reects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benets, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different dened benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one scheme to settle obligations in the other scheme and intends to exercise this right.
i Balance sheet values The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specic Virtually certain costs reimbursed The Group has an obligation to contribute to the pension scheme over the term of the contract.
At rebid, any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
Throughout the contract, it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed the expenditure required to settle the dened benefit obligation.
The Groups share of the dened benefit obligation less its share of the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract, has been recognised as a liability.
The Group has recognised the right to reimbursement as a separate asset.
In the income statement, the expense relating to this dened benefit plan has been presented net of the amount recognised for the reimbursement, resulting in a nil charge to the income statement.
Contract specic Not certain costs reimbursed These are pre-funded dened benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
The Group has recognised as a liability the dened benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the SOCI.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
Non contract specic These consist of a pre-funded dened benefit scheme which does not relate to any specic contract the funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis and an unfunded dened benefit scheme, both of which do not relate to any specic contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.

Retirement benefit schemes continued 30 a Dened benefit schemes continued ii Triennial funding valuation Among our non contract specic schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of this scheme was undertaken as at 6 April 2009 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 141m.
Following this review, the Group agreed with the Trustees to make cash contributions of 30% of members pensionable salaries until 2019, plus lump sum payments of 20m, which was paid in December 2010 and 40m, which was paid in January 2011.
The Group continues to review the level of benets and contributions under the scheme in light of our business needs and changes to pension legislation.

Certain of the Groups non contract specic schemes have a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities.
The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with ination and interest swap overlays.
The assumed expected rate of return is taken to be gilts 0.8% 2011: gilts 0.8%.
In some schemes, employee contributions vary over time to meet a specified proportion of the overall costs, including a proportion of any deficit.
The liabilities recognised in the balance sheet for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
In addition, the amounts charged to the income statement for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
The amounts attributed to employees are shown separately in the reconciliation of changes in the fair value of scheme assets and liabilities.

Assumptions in respect of the expected return on scheme assets are based on market expectations of returns over the life of the related obligation.
Due consideration has been given to current market conditions as at 31 December 2012 in respect to ination, interest, bond yields and equity performance when selecting the expected return on assets assumptions.
The expected yield on bond investments with xed interest rates is derived from their market value.
The yield on equity investments contains an additional premium an equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional anticipated risks of holding this type of investment, when compared to bond yields.
Management have concluded that an appropriate equity risk premium is 4.6% 2011: 4.6%.

Pre-funded dened benefit schemes treated as dened contribution Serco accounts for certain pre-funded dened benefit schemes relating to contracts as dened contribution schemes because the contributions are xed until the end of the current concession and at rebid any surplus or deficit would transfer to the next contractor.
Cash contributions are recognised as pension costs and no asset or liability is shown on the balance sheet.
