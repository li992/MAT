Notes to the Financial Statements For the financial year ended 1 September 2012 1 General information Introduction Debenhams plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Company No.
The address of the registered office is 1 Welbeck Street, London W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The principal activities of the Group and its subsidiaries together the Group or the Debenhams Group is the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group trades from department stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its financial statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
Consequently the financial year ended 1 September 2012 is a 52 week financial year, with the comparative financial year ended 3 September 2011 being a 53 week financial year.
The principal companies within the Group during the financial year ended 1 September 2012 are disclosed in note 33.
2 Accounting policies The Groups principal accounting policies, as described below, have been consistently applied to all financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The consolidated financial statements for the financial years ended 1 September 2012 and 3 September 2011 have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates see note 5.
Consolidation The financial statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where these have a significant impact on the Groups income statement or balance sheet to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession and consignment sales is recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Internet sales are recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer.
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group is recognised on the redemption of the gift card or gift voucher.
Revenue from sales to franchisees is recognised when the goods are despatched.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Segmental reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented based on what is reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identified the executive committee as its Chief Operating Decision Maker and has identified two operating segments, UK and international.
Interest recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
Finance charges are calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend distribution A final dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys and Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
82 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview 2 Strategy review 10 Finance and risk review 32 Sustainability 46 Governance 52 Accounts 75 2 Accounting policies continued Retirement benefit costs The liability or asset recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined obligation at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets include various equities, bonds and alternative strategies and are managed separately by investment managers.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations are determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark and a stakeholder scheme in the UK and Hong Kong.
Contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award.
These are either a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new shares or utilise shares held as treasury shares.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital at nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Foreign exchange a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentation currency.
b Group companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction Resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity c Transactions and balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on exchange are taken to the income statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as available-for-sale are included in the fair value reserve in equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and the translation of inter company loans are presented in the income statement within finance income or charges.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within cost of sales.
Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other financial years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased assets a Finance leases Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are classified as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating leases All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed fixed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Business combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
All costs directly attributable to an acquisition are expensed to the income statement.
Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, provided they meet the conditions set out in IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations.
The excess of cost over the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If, after reassessment, the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of assets acquired, the excess is immediately recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units on a regional basis for the purpose of impairment testing.
b Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
Included within intangible assets are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise primarily web development projects including directly attributable costs to bring the assets into use.
Amortisation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the costs of other intangible assets, less residual value, on a straight line basis from the date on which they are brought into use.
Acquired licences and trademarks Up to 10% Internally generated software 12.5% to 33.3% Purchased software 12.5% to 33.3% 84 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview 2 Strategy review 10 Finance and risk review 32 Sustainability 46 Governance 52 Accounts 75 2 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1% Long leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings 1% or life of lease if shorter Short leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings Life of lease Retail fixtures and fittings 4% 25% Office equipment 10% 12.5% Computer equipment 12.5% 33.3% Vehicles 25% or life of lease The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores, which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
Impairment testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Available-for-sale investments The Group classifies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in equity.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
This method intrinsically takes into account any stock loss or mark down to goods sold below cost.
Concession inventories are not included within inventory held by the Group.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 85 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities using the effective interest rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debt repurchase The nominal value of debt repurchased has been accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Trade payables Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Other payables Included within other payables are lease incentives received from landlords either through developers contributions or rent-free periods.
These incentives are being credited to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Promotional activities Provisions for promotional activities such as the cosmetics loyalty scheme are recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to provide a customer with goods or services.
Restructuring Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where the Company purchases its own ordinary shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled or reissued.
Where such ordinary shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs together with the related income tax effects, are included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Derivatives Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
i Cash flow hedges The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the income statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are fide-designated and subsequently classified as held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is recognised in the financial statements.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the balance sheet or in the income statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the relevant line of the income statement which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii Derivatives That Do Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement within finance costs.
86 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview 2 Strategy review 10 Finance and risk review 32 Sustainability 46 Governance 52 Accounts 75 2 Accounting policies continued New standards and interpretations New or revised standards or interpretations which were mandatory for the first time in the financial year beginning 4 September 2011 did not have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits was in issue, but not yet effective.
Other standards and interpretations in issue, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material effect on the Groups net assets or results.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits, in the financial year starting 1 September 2013, will potentially have a material impact, dependent upon market conditions, on the financial statements of the Group.
The revised standard is expected to increase net finance costs and reduce operating profit.
The extent of this impact is currently being assessed.
3 Segmental reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosure of the operating segments which are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the executive committee, which includes the executive directors and other key management.
It is the executive committee that has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Groups reportable segments have been identified as the UK and international.
These have been re-stated from the previous financial year to better reflect the way in which financial performance is managed.
The segments are reported to the CODM to operating profit level, using the same accounting policies as applied to the Group accounts.
The Group does not review the assets and liabilities by operating segment as these are reviewed on a group-wide basis given their transposable nature.
As a result, no such analysis has been provided.

Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, consignments, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the overall activity of the Group.
1 September 3 September 2012 2011 m m Gross transaction value 2,708.0 2,679.3 A reconciliation of gross transaction value to external revenue is included in note 3.
5 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash flows.
Actual outcomes could vary, see note 13 for further details.
Taxation and deferred taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, Denmark and Hong Kong.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Significant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developers contributions, fair value losses and gains, retirement benefit assets and liabilities and other provisions.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best estimate at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The final outcome of some of these tax items may give rise to material profit or loss and or cash flow movements.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 28.
Retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit schemes pension liability asset, which is assessed each period by actuaries, are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inflation, future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 23.
Estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.

A further reduction to the main rate is proposed to reduce the rate to 22% by 1 April 2014.
This further change has not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and is therefore not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the Finance Act 2012 has been to reduce the net deferred tax asset recognised at 3 September 2011 by approximately 0.1 million.
This 0.1 million decrease has been recognised in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax asset.
The proposed reduction of the main rate of corporation tax to 22% from 1 April 2014 is expected to be enacted separately next year.
The overall effect of the further change from 23% to 22%, if applied to the deferred tax balances at 1 September 2012, would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately 0.8 million.

12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, excluding any shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the financial year.

Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
This allocation was primarily undertaken subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc.
The CGUs are set out below: North Midlands South-East South-West South Other Total m m m m m m m Goodwill 159.3 184.3180.1185.3102.8 6.7 818.5 For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates.
The five year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of 2% growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value-in-use was 8.2% 2011: 8.9% and reflects the specific risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region by region basis and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 1 September 2012 no impairment of goodwill has been required 2011: nil.

The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving Treasury Policy to the Audit Committee.
Reports are prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Chief Financial Officer.
The board and Audit Committee receive regular reporting covering treasury activities and policy compliance.
Group Treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, available-for-sale assets, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups financing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: Funding and liquidity risk Credit risk Foreign exchange risk Interest rate risk Other price risk The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
The objective is to ensure that there is a sufficient cash or working capital facility to meet the cash flow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the Groups net contractual undiscounted cash flows in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
The Groups policy requires that cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit rating of Aor A3 or higher as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys respectively.
Exceptions to this policy require board approval.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements net of any provision for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
iii Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the euro, the Chinese yuan and to a lesser extent the Danish krone.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of up to two years.
Forecast cash flows are hedged to the extent that those cash flows are deemed highly probable.
The Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
A gain of 1.9 million 2011: loss of 1.8 million was reclassified from equity to the income statement within cost of sales during the year in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign exchange contracts at 1 September 2012 was 503.7 million 2011: 461.1 million.
The net fair value gains on open forward foreign exchange contracts at 1 September 2012 are 5.0 million 2011: losses of 4.2 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next two years.
During the current and prior financial years there were no contracts reclassified to held for trading due to cash flow hedges being ineffective.
iv Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target fixed percentage of 75%, with a 15% tolerance 60%-90%.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specific loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the floating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end the Groups hedged borrowings amounted to 330.0 million 2011: 327.5 million, being 78.3% 2011: 78.4% of the Groups total borrowings.

The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is summarised as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 330.0 0.84% - 1.865% 31 October 2015 The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 1 September 2012 was 330.0 million 2011: 327.5 million.
The net gains and losses on these swaps, which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the income statement over the life of the swaps.
During the financial year a loss of 2.0 million 2011: 4.7 million was reclassified and reported in the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
Financial liabilities and assets The interest rate profiles of financial liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from floating to fixed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 1 September 2012 3 September 2011 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Financial liabilities 1 Sterling 336.7 84.4 421.1 330.3 93.7 424.0 1 Debt issue costs of 8.4 million 2011: 11.3 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above Fixed sterling financial liabilities comprise the hedged portion of the debt facility of 330.0 million and finance lease liabilities of 6.7 million at 1 September 2012.
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings as at 1 September 2012 was 3.3% 2011: 3.6%, with the weighted average time for which rates are fixed being 3.2 years 2011: 4.2 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the floating rate interest for more than one year.
The interest rate profiles of financial assets were as follows: 1 September 2012 3 September 2011 Non-interest Non-interest Floating bearing Total Floating bearing Total m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 13.5 23.7 37.2 0.5 20.7 21.2 Euros 1.3 1.9 3.2 0.8 1.2 2.0 US dollars 0.3 0.5 0.8 0.9 0.9 Danish kroner 1.9 1.9 3.1 1.8 4.9 Chinese yuan 0.3 0.3 Other 0.6 0.6 Total financial assets 15.4 28.6 44.0 5.3 23.7 29.0 v Other price risk The Group is exposed to price risk arising from equity investments.

At the year end, if the market value had been 10% higher lower, based on the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to the value of the equity investments, when all other variables were held constant: Net profit would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classified as available-for-sale investments: and Other reserves would decrease increase by 0.2 million 2011: 0.3 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments.
Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 103 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Financial risk management continued b Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
The Group defines capital as debt and equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares: or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing standards, maintaining suitable headroom to bank facility fixed charge and leverage covenants together with credit market requirements to ensure financing requirements continue to be serviceable.
c Fair value estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities to their fair values at the year end.
d Sensitivity analysis The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1% movement in the interest rate or 5% movement in sterling when compared to US dollar, Chinese yuan, Danish krone and euro, reflects the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments that are expressed in currencies different to that of the functional currency.

106 Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview 2 Strategy review 10 Finance and risk review 32 Sustainability 46 Governance 52 Accounts 75 23 Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates defined benefit type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan DEPP and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme DRS together the Groups pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not affect the pensions of those who have retired or the deferred benefits of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
Future pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan in the UK and Hong Kong or a defined contribution scheme for the employees in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
In accordance with the recovery plan for the Groups pension schemes, which is intended to restore the schemes to a fully funded position on an ongoing basis, the Group agreed to contribute 5.8 million per annum from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011 increasing by annual Retail Price Index RPI from the year to 31 December 2009 to fund past service benefits.
The Group agreed to increase its contributions to the Groups pension schemes to 7.0 million per annum from 1 April 2011 until 31 August 2021, increasing by annual RPI from the year to the previous December.
The Group has also agreed to make a further increase in its contributions to the pension schemes to 8.9 million per annum for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 August 2022 increasing by the percentage increase in the RPI over the year to the previous December.
Additionally, the Group has agreed to cover the non-investment expenses and levies of the pension schemes, including those payable to the Pension Protection Fund.
If the Company had paid or declared a dividend during the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, the Group would have made further contributions of 3.1% and 1.9% of the total amount of the ordinary dividend to the DRS and DEPP respectively.
No dividends were declared by the Company during this period.
The investment strategy for the Groups pension schemes was changed during the year ended 3 September 2011.
Investment of the schemes assets is now arranged by AON Hewitt Limited under a delegated consulting service agreement.
As at 1 September 2012 most of the schemes assets are invested in a delegated liability fund or a delegated growth fund, with some legacy holdings from the former investment strategy due to be transferred to the delegated consulting service arrangement in the future.
Actuarial valuations of the Groups pension schemes using the projected unit basis were carried out at 31 March 2011, and updated as at each relevant year end for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits by Towers Watson Limited, a qualified independent actuary.
The 31 March 2011 actuarial valuation has been used when calculating the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation at 1 September 2012.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 1 September 3 September 28 August 2012 2011 2010 per annum per annum per annum % % % Inflation assumption 2.90 3.30 3.20 General salary and wage increase 2.90 3.30 3.20 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred payments 2.90 3.30 3.20 Pension increase rate 2.80 3.20 3.10 Discount rate 4.70 5.75 5.00 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for return over the entire life of the defined benefit obligation.
The inflation assumption is based on the RPI rate as pension increases both in payment and deferment within the schemes are set out with reference to this measure.

Grants under the PSP, SIP and DBMP all comprise a right to acquire shares for no or nominal consideration.
An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP comprises a right to receive free shares or a nil cost option with performance conditions attached.
Awards granted on 24 November 2009 and 23 May 2011 The vesting of the shares granted under these PSP awards is dependent on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
Where growth is less than 6% per annum over the three year period, the awards lapse.
Where growth is 6% per annum, 30% of the shares awarded vest, where growth is 10% per annum, awards vest in full.
Between these two points, awards vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
Awards granted on 1 November 2011 and 1 May 2012 The vesting of the shares granted under these awards is dependent upon the growth of both EPS and Return on Capital Employed ROCE.
75% of the awards is based upon EPS growth.
Where growth is less than 6% per annum over the three year period, this element of the awards lapse.
Where growth is 6% per annum, 30% of the shares awarded vest, where growth is 12% per annum, the EPS element of the awards vest in full.
The remaining 25% of the awards is dependent upon ROCE.
If average ROCE is below the cost of capital over the three year period, this element of the awards lapse.
If average ROCE is equal to the cost of capital over the three year period, then 30% of the shares awarded vest.
If average ROCE is equal to the cost of capital plus 5% then the ROCE element of the awards vest in full.
Debenhams plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 113 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 28 Share-based payments continued i The Debenhams Performance Share Plan continued Awards granted on 1 November 2011 and 1 May 2012 continued In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments, the vesting conditions attached to the PSP are classified as non-market conditions and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value with a discount to take into account the non-entitlement to dividends in the vesting period where relevant.
The fair value of these PSP awards is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown in the table below: 1 May 1 November 23 May 24 November Grant date 2012 2011 2011 2009 Number of shares under award number 391,987 5,137,864 191,250 1,755,784 Expected term years 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Share price at grant pence 84.0 64.0 72.0 83.3 Exercise price pence Risk free rate 0% 0% 0% 2.3% Expected volatility 40% 40% N A 70.0% Expected dividend yield 3.5% 7.4% 5.0% 0% Fair value of award pence 75.0 59.0 62.0 83.3 Where volatility has been used in the calculation of fair value it has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price.
ii Executive Share Option Plan The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options will normally become exercisable following a three year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
Once the options have vested, the employees have a seven year period in which to exercise.
Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options granted on 24 November 2009 The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on the Companys ROCE exceeding the cost of capital.
Where the ROCE is less than or equal to the cost of capital over a three year period, no options will vest.
Where the ROCE is greater than the cost of capital, 30% will vest, where the ROCE is greater than the cost of capital plus 5%, 100% will vest.
Between these two points the options will vest on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%.
The fair value of the share options has been calculated using a Black-Scholes model.
The key assumptions are set out in the table below.
24 November Grant date 2009 Number of shares under option number 831,623 Expected term years 3.0 Share price at grant pence 85.5 Exercise price pence 85.5 Risk free rate 2.3% Expected volatility 70.0% Expected dividend yield 0% Fair value of option pence 40.7 Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price.
The weighted average exercise price of the ESOP at 1 September 2012 was 85.5 pence 2011: 85.5 pence.
iii Share incentive plan The SIP allows the Company to grant options to key senior managers below board level, whom the Company wishes to retain and incentivise in the short to medium term.
Once the options have vested the employee has six months in which to exercise.

The fair value of the SIP options granted is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 21 May 16 November Grant date 2012 2010 Number of shares under option number 200,000 250,000 Expected term years 2.5 2.0 Share price at grant pence 80.0 70.0 Exercise price pence Risk free rate 0% 0% Expected volatility 40.0% 100.0% Expected dividend yield 3.8% 5.0% Fair value of option pence 73.0 63.3 The option over 150,000 shares granted under the SIP on 23 May 2011 was forfeited.
iv Deferred Bonus Matching Plan The DBMP allows the Company to invite eligible employees to invest up to 100% of their net annual bonus earned into shares invested shares.
If the participant remains in service for three years and retains the beneficial ownership of all the invested shares s he will, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions be entitled to a matching share award equal to the amount of the pre-tax bonus that has been invested.
Once the options have vested they will be released to the employee within one month of the vesting date.

The entitlement to the matching award is subject to the participant retaining beneficial ownership of their invested shares during the performance period and to the achievement of the following performance conditions.
The Groups ROCE must exceed the cost of capital by 2% over this period otherwise the options will not vest.
The Groups EPS growth must then exceed 6% per annum over the three year period or the options will not vest.
If the Groups EPS growth is 6% or more per annum over the three year period 30% of the options will vest: if the growth is 12% or more per annum over the three year period, 100% of the options will vest.

The Group establishes provisions in connection with litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely that not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Since these provisions, which are reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements, represent estimates, the final resolution of any such matters could have a material effect on the Groups operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period.
