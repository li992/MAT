share based payment Rexam PLC operates various equity settled share option schemes.
The services received from employees are measured by reference to thefair value of the share options.
The fair value is calculated at grant date and recognised in the profit and loss account, together with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
Equity settled share options granted directly to subsidiary company employees are treated as a capital contribution to the subsidiary.
The capital contribution is measured by reference to the fair value of the share options and recognised as an increase in the cost of investment with a corresponding increase in shareholders funds.
The recognition of the fair value is based on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of options that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, which comprise service conditions and non market performance conditions, are not taken into account when estimating the fair value.
Allmarket and non vesting conditions are included in fair value.
The Rexam Employee Share Trust holds shares in Rexam PLC which are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from shareholders funds.
tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provision for depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of tangible fixed assets over their expected lives by equal annual instalments.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets.
Assumed lives vary according to the class of asset as follows: Computer hardware and software UP ZFBST Fixtures and fittings UP ZFBST investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment where appropriate.
dividends Under FRS21, final ordinary dividends payable to the shareholders of Rexam PLC are recognised in the period that they are approved by the shareholders.
Interim ordinary dividends payable are recognised in the period that they are paid.
Dividends receivable are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
149 1 principal accounting policies continued financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments used by the Company include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and forward aluminium commodity contracts.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Companys risk management policies.
Hedges are classified as follows: i fair value hedges where they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
ii cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with arecognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the profit and loss account.
For cash flow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in reserves, with any ineffective portion recognised in the profit and loss account.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in reserves are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in reserves are transferred to the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the profit and loss account.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Borrowings are measured at amortised cost except where they are hedged by an effective fair value hedge, in which case the carrying value is adjusted to reflect the fair value movements associated with the hedged risk.
Up front fees paid on the establishment of loan and bond facilities are initially capitalised as transaction costs of the loan and bond and amortised in interest over the expected term of the loan and bond.
Ongoing commitment fees are expensed in interest as incurred.
Debtors are measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
Debtors are discounted when the time value of money isconsidered material.
