Our business Governance Financial statements Other information Notes to the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 1Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation European law requires that the Groups consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
This will also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company including all of its subsidiary entities after eliminating internal transactions.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the acquisition method of accounting.
The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date of control.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are of a nonrecurring nature to the results for the period and are therefore presented separately.
External transaction costs External transaction costs are of a nonrecurring nature to the results for the period and are therefore presented separately.
They relate wholly to external costs incurred by the Group.
Prearranged funeral plan trusts The three prearranged funeral plan trusts were not consolidated during the period as they were not controlled by the Group.
Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Regulated Activities Order 2001 requires a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group.
Furthermore, the Group did not direct their financial and operating policies, nor did it have substantially all of the risks and rewards of their ownership.
Revenue Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Revenues include amounts receivable from the prearranged funeral plan trusts for funerals performed by the Group for prearranged funeral plan members.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied.
Costs of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
The accounting policies for recognising turnover for prearranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers fees and doctors fees on behalf of its clients.
These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process.
However, these amounts are not included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
The Group views the United Kingdom as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long term characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 59 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 1Accounting policies continued Prearranged funeral plans Trust plans The Group markets and sells prearranged funeral plans, monies received from selling funeral plans being held and controlled by independent prearranged funeral plan trusts the Trusts.
The responsibility for the ultimate performance of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan and some of whom are not owned by the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions: A marketing and administration allowance in respect of each plan sold.
The marketing element is only refundable in the event that the plan is subsequently cancelled.
A provision is made for cancellations based on historical experiences, where material, to cover the estimated marketing element refundable to the Trusts.
Marketing and administration allowances are included in Group revenue when the related plan is sold less the provision for refunds arising on cancellations: and Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative services supplied to the Trusts.
These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the prearranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trusts deed, which have been assessed by the trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities in respect of current members Recoveries.
All Recoveries are recognised as other operating income in the period in which the trustees approve their payment.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to members of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to third party funeral directors when the funeral is ultimately performed.
All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Trusts deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the Group when a prearranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a prearranged funeral plan that i if the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all monies paid in respect thereof less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing company : ii the funeral directors services as selected by the customer will be provided regardless of price rises in the future: and iii for certain plans sold, specific disbursements will be provided regardless of price rises in the future.
Insurance plans The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral including some disbursements of the plan holder at no further charge.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group.
As this commission is fully refundable if the Group does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a receivable and expensed when the funeral is performed.
In the event of death of the policyholder, the Group makes an agreed payment to the nominated funeral director and a receivable is recognised.
At this time a commission fee is recognised as turnover.
All monies are reclaimed in full from the life insurance company.
Sharebased payments The Group issues equity settled sharebased payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include BlackScholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The valuations take into account factors such as nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straightline basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
When the options are exercised the Company issues new shares.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 60 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information 1Accounting policies continued Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by the effects of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares primarily share options.
Underlying Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the underlying profit after tax by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration for subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cashgenerating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The business and subsidiaries acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition, or the year thereafter and are therefore only considered to be separate cashgenerating units during this time.
Intangible assets trade names Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are carried at historical cost less provisions for amortisation and impairment.
When acquired as part of a business combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by virtue of the trade name being wellestablished.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to writeoff the asset on a straightline basis over the term of its useful life.
Where there are indicators that a trade name has an indefinite life then these assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
The factors that indicate an indefinite life of trade names acquired include the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a wellestablished market with inelastic demand, the conservative nature of the UK funeral industry that acts as a barrier to entry for new trade names, and the Groups track record for actively monitoring and relocating trade names to combat shifting demographics.
In addition, when allocating a useful life to acquired trade names, the following matters are considered: The strength of the trade name in its local environment which is assessed by reference to relative market share and anticipated profitability: The likelihood that market based factors could truncate a trade names life such as competition and shifting demographics and the Groups ability to combat these: The length of time, prior to acquisition, for which trade has been conducted under the name acquired: and The likely support the Group will give to the name in its local environment through marketing and promotion, maintaining community awareness etc.
The useful lives of all capitalised trade names are considered to be indefinite and are reviewed on an annual basis.
Intangible assets noncompete contracts Noncompete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at the fair value, which is calculated as the present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Groups cost of capital.
All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straightline basis.
Intangible assets software Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development of computer systems including websites is recognised if and only if the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
All other costs incurred in research or development are expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs will include, where appropriate, directly attributable payroll costs and a portion of direct overheads.
Costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives three to eight years using the straightline method.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 61 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 1Accounting policies continued Intangible assets use of third party brand name The Group has a marketing agreement with Age UK Enterprises Limited, giving rights to market prearranged funeral plans under the Age UK brand.
The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over twenty years on a straightline basis, recognising that each years additional marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following twenty years.
Property, plant and equipment Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and condition.
Depreciation is charged excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction so as to write off the cost of assets to their residual value, over their expected useful lives using the straightline method.
The bases and annual depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% 10% Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease Motor vehicles 11% 20% Computers 20% Other plant and equipment 5% 33% Fixtures and fittings 15% Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an unlimited life.
Where the historical cost of land and buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third based on historical data of the original cost of acquiring the land and buildings.
This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Groups trading premises and crematory relinings are depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator relining, whichever is sooner.
Asset lives and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs If the construction phase of property, plant or equipment extends over a long period, the interest incurred on borrowed capital up to the date of completion is capitalised as part of cost of construction in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.
Repairs and renewals All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included as an obligation under finance leases.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned assets.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement.
Profit on sale of fixed assets Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within profit on sale of fixed assets in the income statement.
Impairment of assets The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life e. g. goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
For goodwill this is considered at a business segment level as that is the level at which the return on assets acquired is monitored.
For other intangibles principally trade names this is considered at a regional level for each business segment as this is the level where cash inflows are largely independent.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 62 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information 1Accounting policies continued In assessing value in use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cashgenerating unit are estimated, based on latest management expectations for the following year and an annual growth rate in subsequent years.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset.
Any impairment in the value of an asset below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax charge represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset to generate a net asset or liability.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value of an asset is greater than its associated tax basis or where the carrying value of a liability is less than its associated tax basis.
Deferred tax is provided for any differences that exist between the tax base and accounting base of intangibles arising from a business combination that does not involve the acquisition of a subsidiary.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Pensions The cost of defined contribution retirement schemes is charged as an expense as the costs become payable.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short term asset or liability.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straightline basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit.
The expected return on plan assets less the interest arising on the pension liabilities is presented within net finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the consolidated income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension plan.
The rate of return is determined by identifying an appropriate rate of return for each class of asset held in conjunction with the Groups professional adviser.
The retirement benefit net asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of any relevant scheme assets net of the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost.
The discount rate applied in arriving at the present value represents yields on high quality corporate bonds in a similar economic environment with lives similar to the maturity of the pension liabilities.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company or the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 63 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 1Accounting policies continued Provisions other than deferred tax are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to the undiscounted value.
The unwinding of discounts is included within finance costs.
Employee share trust The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the Directors consider that Dignity plc has fide facto control.
In accordance with IFRS 2, sharebased payment, the trusts assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet within share capital and reserves.
Dividends Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when paid.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions recognised in the income statement are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate on the date the transaction took place.
Financial instruments Borrowings All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs.
The transaction costs, interest payable and premium on debt finance are charged credited to the income statement, as finance costs income, on a constantyield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will require earlier repayment using the effective interest method.
Early termination costs on borrowings Premiums and discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are writtenoff to the income statement as incurred.
Interest rate swaps The Group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy.
It does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest rate risk associated with net debt is managed by using a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings and financial liabilities.
The cash flows from, and losses arising on terminations of, these contracts are recognised as cash flows from operating activities.
See note 16 c for further information.
Trade receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience.
When a trade receivable is not collectable it is writtenoff against the allowance account.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously writtenoff are credited against administration expenses in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Critical accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables, postretirement benefits, the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets.
Provision for doubtful trade receivables Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired.
Within each division, assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the type of services provided.
The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 64 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information 1Accounting policies continued Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the inflation rate.
See note 28 for further details.
"Goodwill The Group tests annually whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 1 ""Impairment of assets""."
The recoverable amounts of cashgenerating units have been determined based on valueinuse calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of these cash flows.
Actual outcomes could vary from those calculated.
See note 9 for further details.
"Other intangible assets The decision process to ascertain whether trade names will have an indefinite life are detailed in note 1 ""Intangible assets trade names""."
These assets with an indefinite life are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on valueinuse calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2012 There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 January 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 28 December 2012 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IAS 1, Financial statement presentation, regarding other comprehensive income.
This amendment requires entities to group items presented in other comprehensive income on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassifiable to profit or loss subsequently reclassification adjustments.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the amendment.
IAS 19, Employee benefits was amended in June 2011, effective 1 January 2013.
The impact on the Group will be as follows: to immediately recognise all past service costs and to replace interest costs and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit asset.
This is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.
IAS 27 revised 2011, Separate financial statements, effective 1 January 2013.
This revision includes the requirements relating to separate financial statements.
This is not expected to have any impact on the Group.
IAS 32 amendment, Financial instruments: Presentation and IFRS 7, Financial instruments disclosure on asset and liability offsetting, effective 1 January 2014.
These amendments are to the application guidance in IAS 32 and clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments to replace IAS 39, Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement.
This standard introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial assets and is likely to affect the Groups accounting for financial assets.
The standard is not applicable until 1 January 2015 subject to endorsement by the EU.
The impact of this standard is currently being assessed.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, effective 1 January 2014, builds on existing principals by identifying the concept on control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
IFRS 12, Disclosure of interests in other entities, effective 1 January 2014.
This standard includes disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of this standard but it is not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 65 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 1Accounting policies continued IFRS 13, Fair value measurement, effective 1 January 2014.
This standard aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurements and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS13s full impact.
These annual improvements address six issues in the 20092011 reporting cycle.
It includes changes to: IFRS 1, First time adoption, IAS1, Financial statement presentation, IAS 16, Property plant and equipment and IAS 34, Interim financial reporting.
There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
2 Financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders funds, Secured Notes and bank borrowings.
This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value through efficient leveraging of the Groups balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cashgenerative nature of the business.
It is not the Groups policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk Currency risk All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
The Group purchases minimal amounts from overseas.
Accordingly, exposure to currency fluctuations are not significant and therefore not actively managed.
Interest rate risk and other price risk The Groups main borrowings consist of Class A and B Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a predetermined repayment profile.
The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and yield spreads based on the markets current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes.
Consequently, the fair value of these instruments will fluctuate.
Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding strategy and repay the Secured Notes early.
The Group also has a 10 million Crematoria Acquisition Facility the Crematoria Acquisition Facility.
7.4 million carries interest at 5.59 per cent per annum.
The remaining 2.6 million carries interest at a rate relative to three month LIBOR, with such rate being capped at 5.59 per cent.
Consequently, the Group carries limited risk to increases in LIBOR on this facility.
The Crematoria Acquisition Facility was refinanced in February 2013 as described in the Financial Review.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions rated at least A1 by Standard and Poors.
These balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate.
If interest rates reduced by one per cent at the beginning of 2012 then the Group would receive 0.1 million less interest income on an annualised basis for each 10.0 million held.
None of the Groups other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group.
However, this risk is minimised as much as possible through wellestablished credit control procedures.
Quantitative disclosures regarding the aging of these receivables are included in note 21 c. Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities and regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances.
In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5 times.
This ratio was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid.
This covenant test has been satisfied on each quarterly testing date in the period.
At 28 December 2012 the actual ratio was 2.43 times 2011: 2.27 times.
Capital risk management The Groups objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and repay holders of Class A and B Secured Notes.
It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
The Groups capital comprises equity and net debt as set out in note 24.
The Groups principal source of long term debt financing is the Class A and B Secured Notes, rated A and BBB respectively by Standards & Poors and A and BBB respectively by Fitch.
Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 66 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information 2 Financial risk management continued The Group monitors its capital structure based on gross debt, as summarised in note 24, to underlying earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation.
In order to achieve these objectives, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants under the terms of the Groups secured borrowings see Liquidity risk above.
3 Revenue and segmental analysis Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
The chief operating decision maker of the Group has been identified as the four Executive Directors.
The Group has three reporting segments, funeral services, crematoria and prearranged funeral plans.
The Group also reports central overheads, which comprise unallocated central expenses.
Funeral services relate to the provision of funerals and ancillary items, such as memorials and floral tributes.
Crematoria services relate to cremation services and the sale of memorials and burial plots at the Groups crematoria and cemeteries.
Prearranged funeral plans represent the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make their own funeral arrangements and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.
Substantially all Group revenue is derived from, and substantially all of the Groups net assets are located in, the United Kingdom and Channel Islands and relates to services provided.
Overseas transactions are not material.
Underlying profit is stated before profit on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs and exceptional items.
Underlying operating profit is included as it is felt that adjusting operating profit for these items provides a useful indication of the Groups performance.
The operating profit which includes Recoveries within prearranged funeral plans of 1.5 million in both periods, by segment, was as follows: Profit on sale of fixed assets, Underlying external

The differences are explained below: 52 week period 52 week period ended ended 28 December 30 December 2012 2011 m m Profit before taxation 45.4 40.3 Profit before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% 11.1 10.7 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior period 0.3 Exceptional adjustment in respect of closing deferred tax rate change 25% to 23% 2011: 27% to 25% 2.0 1.8 Exceptional adjustment for recognition of brought forward losses 3.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.3 0.5 Total taxation 9.7 6.0 Under IFRS the tax rate is lower 2011: lower than the standard UK tax rate of 24.5 per cent 2011: 26.5 per cent principally due to the exceptional adjustments in both periods.
Without these exceptional adjustments the rate would be higher 2011: higher due to a combination of the impact of disallowable trading expenses and expenditure on the Groups premises that does not attract any deductions for tax purposes.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 26 per cent to 24 per cent with effect from 1 April 2012.
Accordingly the Groups profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 25.5 per cent 2011: 27.5 per cent.
As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax income of 2.0 million 2011: 1.8 million through its income statement to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Groups deferred tax position.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and so the deferred tax balance has been calculated at 23 per cent.
Further rate changes are anticipated, if these are subsequently enacted in the form expected then the corporation tax rate will reduce by a further two per cent in 2014 when it will be 21 per cent.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.
Each percentage point reduction in corporation tax rate is expected to reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 1 million.
These impacts will be recognised in the period in which substantive enactment occurs.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 71 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 7 Dividends continued The final dividend represents the final dividend that was approved and paid in the period relating to the earnings generated in the previous period.
Consequently, total dividends recognised in the period were 8.3 million, 15.13 pence per share 2011: 7.5 million, 13.75 pence per share.
A final dividend of 10.75 pence per share, in respect of 2012, has been proposed by the Board.
This will be paid on 28 June 2013 provided that approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2013 and will be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 24 May 2013.
8 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees under the Groups SAYE Scheme and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups LTIP Schemes.
At the balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not been met and these contingently issuable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before profit on sale of fixed assets, external transaction costs, exceptional items and after taxation is a useful indication of the Groups performance, as it excludes significant non recurring items.
This reporting measure is defined as Underlying profit after taxation.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance.
Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Weighted average number of Per share Earnings shares amount m millions pence 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 35.7 54.8 65.1 Deduct: Exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and external transaction costs net of taxation of nil million 1.3 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 34.4 54.8 62.8 52 week period ended 30 December 2011 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 34.3 54.8 62.6 Deduct: Exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and external transaction costs net of taxation of 0.2 million 4.1 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 30.2 54.8 55.1 In 2012 and 2011, the potential issue of new shares pursuant to the Groups share option plans would have no impact on the calculation of earnings per share.

For the purpose of impairment testing: i Goodwill is tested at a business segment level.
ii Other intangible assets are allocated to the Groups cashgenerating units CGUs which are considered to be on a regional basis.
The segmental allocation is shown below: Intangible assets Goodwill Total At 28 December 2012 m m m Funeral services 51.0 106.1 157.1 Crematoria 40.3 40.3 Prearranged funeral plans 2.3 4.7 7.0 Central overheads 0.1 0.1 53.4 151.1 204.5 At 30 December 2011 Funeral services 43.6 103.0 146.6 Crematoria 40.3 40.3 Prearranged funeral plans 2.6 4.7 7.3 Central overheads 0.1 0.1 46.3 148.0 194.3 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 73 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of a CGU is based on a valueinuse calculation.
However, the assets allocated to central overheads are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The valueinuse calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest management expectations.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates based on historical death rates supplied by ONS, anticipated market share based on actual experience and anticipated price increases based on actual experience.
Cash flows beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.25 per cent 2011: 2.25 per cent.
The cash flows are discounted at a pretax rate of 10.2 per cent 2011: 10.2 per cent.
This rate is used to analyse each CGU because they all have similar risk profiles.
Based on these calculations, the discount rate would have to increase to at least 21 per cent 2011: 20 per cent, or the growth rate would have to reduce to at least minus 10 per cent 2011: minus 9 per cent to result in any impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and working capital.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment 2011: nil.
Included within plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings net book value is 7.8 million 2011: 7.3 million relating to assets held in the course of construction.
In 2012, borrowing costs of 0.2 million 2011: 0.6 million were capitalised as components of the cost of construction of qualifying assets, applying an annualised average capitalisation rate of 6.8 per cent 2011: 6.9 per cent.
Details of any securities over assets are disclosed in note 30.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 77 | Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2012 16 Financial liabilities continued c Other financial liabilities On 20 December 2002, Dignity 2002 Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan into fixed rate.
Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16 a, the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest.
These notes replaced the bank loan.
Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the Secured Notes.
As a result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the Group makes fixed and determinable biannual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement.
This master agreement forces the swaps to be viewed and settled on a net basis only: a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability.
The fair value represents the discounted net present value of future cash flows.
Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has been accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance with IAS 39. d Crematoria Acquisition Facility The Group also has a 10 million Crematoria Acquisition Facility the Crematoria Acquisition Facility.
The Crematoria Acquisition Facility is fully drawn and will be repayable in one payment in November 2013.
The transaction costs incurred on the Crematoria Acquisition Facility were 0.2 million.

c Cancellation provision As described in note 1, the Group receives monies from certain prearranged funeral plan Trusts in respect of the marketing of prearranged funeral plans, which are refundable to the Trust in the event of cancellation.
The provision covers the expected cost of such cancellations anticipated to occur in future years relating to plans sold before the balance sheet date and is anticipated to be utilised over the next five years.

Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 80 | Our business Governance Financial statements Other information 20 Deferred tax continued During 2011, a deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of previously unrecognised losses within the Group.
These amounted to 3.4 million net, of which 0.7 million has been utilised in the period 2011: 2.7 million.
Accordingly these have now been fully utilised.
There are no further unrecognised deferred tax losses within the Group.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable recoverable within one year.
However, the Directors consider that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.

These amounts do not represent sources of funding for the Group and are therefore excluded from the calculation of net debt.
The Groups primary financial covenant in respect of the Secured Notes requires EBITDA to total debt service to be at least 1.5 times.
At 28 December 2012, the actual ratio was 2.43 times 2011: 2.27 times.
These ratios are calculated for EBITDA and total debt service on a 12 month rolling basis and reported quarterly.
In addition, both terms are specifically defined in the legal agreement relating to the Secured Notes.
As such, they cannot be accurately calculated from the contents of this report.

These transactions were either acquisitions of trade and assets or acquisitions of the entire issued share capital of a limited company.
All these acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method.
None were individually material and consequently have been aggregated.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
This represents the value to the Group of the funeral locations.
The fair value adjustments contain provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2013.
These adjustments reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation, and adjustments to reflect the fair value of other working capital movements such as receivables, inventories and accruals which are immaterial.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and as such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the post acquisition results.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.

These companies have sold prearranged funeral plans to their clients in the past.
All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age UK Funeral Plans respectively.
Further details of the transactions can be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from 4 King Edwards Court, King Edwards Square, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B73 6AP.
The Group has given commitments to certain of these clients to perform their funeral.
The agreed amounts payable to either the Group or to third party funeral directors will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
It is the view of the Directors that none of the commitments given to these clients are onerous to the Group.
b Prearranged funeral plan trust assets The market value of the assets of the prearranged funeral plan trusts was 511.2 million at 28 December 2012 2011: 446.8 million in respect of 238,000 2011: 220,000 unfulfilled prearranged funeral plans.
The remaining 52,000 2011: 45,000 unfulfilled prearranged funeral plans related to those backed by Insurance Plans, as described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
The majority of the trustees of the prearranged funeral plan trusts are unconnected to the Group, as required by current UK legislation.
The trustees are required to have the Trusts liabilities actuarially valued once a year.
The latest valuations were performed as at 28 September 2012 2011: 30 September 2011 using assumptions determined by the trustees.
These valuations showed the Trusts to have liabilities in respect of the pre arranged funeral plan trusts of 465.4 million as at 28 September 2012 2011: 373.3 million.
The corresponding market value of the assets of the prearranged funeral plan trusts was 479.4 million 2011: 415.7 million as at the same date.
Consequently the actuarial valuation recorded total surpluses of 14.0 million at 28 September 2012 2011: 42.4 million.
c Accounting reporting date The end of the reporting period of the financial statements of the Trusts may be different to the reporting period of the financial statements of Dignity plc, but by no more than 7 days.
