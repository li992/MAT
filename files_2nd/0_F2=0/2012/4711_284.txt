Taxation This section provides a descriptive summary of certain US federal income tax and UK tax consequences that are likely to be material to the holders of the ordinary shares or ADSs, but only those who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes.
It does not purport to be a complete technical analysis or a listing of all potential tax effects relevant to the ownership of the ordinary shares and ADSs.

It assumes that holders of ADSs will be treated as holders of the underlying ordinary shares.
In addition to those persons mentioned above, this section does not apply to holders that are banks, regulated investment companies, other financial institutions or to persons who have or are deemed to have acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs in the course of an employment or trade.
This summary does not apply to persons who are treated as non-domiciled and resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for the purposes of UK tax law.
This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings and court decisions, the laws of the United Kingdom and the practice of Her Majestys Revenue and Customs, all as currently in effect, as well as on the Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Tax on Income and Capital Gains the Treaty.
These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis.
In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
In general, and taking into account this assumption, for US federal income tax purposes and for the purposes of the Treaty, holders of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those ADSs.
Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to US federal income tax or to UK tax on profits or gains.

This section is not intended to provide specific advice and no action should be taken or omitted in reliance upon it.
This section addresses only certain aspects of US federal income tax and UK income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax and stamp taxes.
Holders of the ordinary shares or ADSs are urged to consult their own tax adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, and UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of the shares or ADSs in their respective circumstances.
In particular, holders are encouraged to confirm with their adviser whether they are a US holder eligible for the benefits of the Treaty.
Dividends UK taxation There is no UK withholding tax on dividends.
A shareholder who is an individual resident for UK tax purposes in the United Kingdom that receives a dividend from the company will generally be entitled to a tax credit equal to one-ninth of the dividend.
The individual will be taxable on the total of the dividend and the related credit, known as the gross dividend, which will be regarded as the top slice of the individuals income.
In the case of a shareholder who is liable to income tax at the basic rate, the tax credit will be treated as discharging the individuals liability to income tax in respect of the gross dividend.
In the case of a shareholder who is liable to income tax at the higher rate, the individual will be subject to tax on the gross dividend at the rate of 32.5%, to the extent that the gross dividend falls above the threshold for the higher rate of income tax when it is treated as mentioned above as the top slice of the individuals income.
This means that the tax credit will satisfy only part of the individuals liability to income tax on the gross dividend, so that the individual will have to account for income tax equal to 22.5% of the gross dividend.
In the case of a shareholder who is liable to income tax at the additional rate, the individual will be subject to tax on the gross dividend at the rate of 42.5%, to the extent that the gross dividend falls above the threshold for the additional rate of income tax when it is treated as mentioned above as the top slice of the individuals income.
This means that the tax credit will satisfy only part of the individuals liability to income tax on the gross dividend, so that the individual will have to account for income tax equal to 32.5% of the gross dividend.
Shareholders within the charge to UK corporation tax which are small companies for the purposes of the UK taxation of dividends will not generally be subject Additional information for shareholders 189
