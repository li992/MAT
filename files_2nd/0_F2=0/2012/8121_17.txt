2012 Operations Governance Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
General information Inmarsat plc the Company or together with its subsidiaries, the Group is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and domiciled in England and Wales.
The address of its registered office is 99 City Road, London EC1Y 1AX, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5.
The Companys ticker symbol on the London Stock Exchange is ISAT LSE: ISAT.
Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31December2012 and 2011 the consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Groups financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU International Accounting Standards IAS regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities, as described later in these accounting policies.
The Group has a robust and resilient business model, strong free cash flow generation and is compliant with all covenants.
As a consequence and despite the continuing uncertain economic climate, the Directors believe that the Group is well-placed to manage its business risks successfully.
After considering current financial projections and facilities available and after making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, Inmarsat plc continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The Groups business activities, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business Model, the Executive Chairmans Review, the Chief Executives Strategic and Business Reviews and the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 2 to 31.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Chief Financial Officers Review on pages 20 to 31.
In addition, notes 3, 31 and 32 to the financial statements include the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its financial risk management objectives, its capital, details of its financial instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of accounting The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best estimate of the amounts, events or actions, the actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
The following Standards and Interpretations, as adopted by the EU, are effective for the first time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated results or financial position: IFRS 7 as amended Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments enhancing disclosures about transfers of financial assets effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2011 : and IAS 12 as amended Income Taxes Limited scope amendment recovery of underlying assets effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2012.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 7 as amended Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments to facilitate comparison between financial statements prepared under IFRS and under US GAAP effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2013 : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Classification and Measurement effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2015 : IFRS 10 as amended Consolidated Financial Statements effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IFRS 11 as amended Joint Arrangements effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IFRS 12 as amended Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IAS 1 as amended Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to revise the way other comprehensive income is presented effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2012 : IAS 19 as amended Employee Benefits Amended standard resulting from the Post-Employment Benefits and Termination Benefits projects effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2013 : IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Reissued as IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements as amended in 2011 effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IAS 28 Investments in Associates Reissued as IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as amended in 2011 effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013 : IAS 32 as amended Financial Instruments: Presentation Amended application guidance to clarify offsetting of financial assets and liabilities on the balance sheet effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2014 : Inmarsat plc 65 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January2013 : and Amendments resulting from the Annual Improvements 2009-2011 cycle paper issued in May 2012 effective for financial years beginning on or after 1January 2013.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its domestic and overseas subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
The results of subsidiary undertakings established or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of establishment or acquisition of control.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the period are included until the date of disposal.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All transactions, balances, income and expenses with and between subsidiary undertakings have been eliminated on consolidation.
On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the total consideration, both paid and deferred, exceeds the fair value of the identifiable separable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Fees and similar incremental costs incurred directly in making the acquisition are recorded in the Income Statement as incurred, in line with IFRS 3.
Where the deferred consideration is payable in cash, the liability is discounted to its present value.
Where the deferred consideration is contingent upon future trading performance, an estimate of the present value of the deferred consideration payable is made.
The contingent deferred consideration is reassessed annually and any gain or loss on remeasurement is recorded in the IncomeStatement.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the noncontrolling interests share of changes in equity since the date of the original combination.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency The functional currency of the Company and all of the Groups subsidiaries and the presentation currency of the Group is the USDollar, as the majority of operational transactions are denominated in US Dollars.
The hedged rate between US Dollar and Pound Sterling for 2012 for Inmarsat Globals Sterling operating expenditure was US$1.48 1.00 2011: US$1.51 1.00. b Transactions and balances Transactions not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertakings of the Group during the year have been translated using the spot rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising on the settlement of the transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in the IncomeStatement.
Monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiary undertaking of the Group have been translated at the spot rates of exchange ruling at the end of each month.
Differences on exchange arising from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currency are recognised in equity to the extent that the foreign exchange exposure is hedged while the remaining differences are recognised in the Income Statement.
Financial instruments and hedging activities Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Financial instruments are initially measured at fair value.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as trade receivables, other receivables, accrued income, short-term deposits or cash and cash equivalents.
They are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, subject to reduction for allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
For interest-bearing assets, their carrying value includes accrued interest receivable.
In the Cash Flow Statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Nonderivative financial liabilities are classified as borrowings, trade payables, other liabilities and accruals and stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs.
66 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised and measured at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and subsequently measured at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the Income Statement except where the derivative is a designated cash flow hedging instrument.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument.
The Group is also required to demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.
This effectiveness testing is reperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Gains or losses on cash flow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity.
Where the forecast transaction results in a financial asset or liability, gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to the Income Statement in the same period as the asset or liability impacts income.
If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure.
The ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the IncomeStatement.
Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the Income Statement when the committed or forecasted transaction is recognised in the Income Statement.
However, where the Group has applied cash flow hedge accounting for a forecasted or committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Income Statement.
Revenue recognition Mobile satellite communications services revenue results from utilisation charges that are recognised as revenue in the period during which the services are provided.
Deferred income attributable to mobile satellite communications services or subscription fees represents the unearned balances remaining from amounts received from customers pursuant to prepaid contracts.
Mobile satellite communications services lease revenues are recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract concerned, which is typically between one and 12 months, unless another systematic basis is deemed more appropriate.
Revenue also includes income from spectrum coordination agreements, services contracts, other communications services and income from the sale of terminals and other communication equipment.
Revenue from spectrum coordination agreements is recognised using the percentage of completion or straight-line approach depending on the underlying terms of the agreement see note 4 d. Revenue from service contracts is recognised as the service is provided.
Sales of terminals and other communication equipment are recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the purchaser.
The Company offers certain products and services as part of multiple deliverable arrangements.
Multi-deliverable arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting provided, 1 the deliverable has a standalone value to the customer if it is sold separately, and 2 the fair value of the item can be objectively and reliably determined.
Consideration for these items is measured and allocated to each separate unit based on their relative fair values and the Companys relevant revenue recognition policies are applied to them.
Employee benefits Wages, salaries, social security contributions, accumulating annual leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which the associated services are performed by the employees of the Group.
Termination benefits are payable whenever an employees employment is terminated before the normal retirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The Group recognises termination benefits when it has demonstrably committed to either terminate the employment of current employees or to provide termination benefits, as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
The Group recognises liabilities relating to defined benefit pension plans and post-employment benefits in respect of employees.
The Groups net obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans and post-employment benefits are calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets are immediately recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
Pension costs for the defined contribution schemes are charged to the Income Statement when the related employee service is rendered.
The Group issues equity-settled share options and awards to employees.
Equity-settled share option awards are measured at fair value at the date of the grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Inmarsat plc 67 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary deductible differences or tax loss carry forwards can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Research and development Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
Development expenditure is expensed when incurred unless it meets criteria for capitalisation.
Development costs are only capitalised once the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a business case has been demonstrated and they can be measured reliably.
Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life.
Property, plant and equipment Space segment assets Space segment assets comprise satellite construction, launch and other associated costs, including ground infrastructure.
Expenditure charged to space segment projects includes invoiced progress payments, amounts accrued appropriate to the stage of completion of contract milestones, external consultancy costs and direct internal costs.
Internal costs, comprising primarily staff costs, are only capitalised when they are directly attributable to the construction of an asset.
Progress payments are determined on milestones achieved to date together with agreed cost escalation indices.
Deferred satellite payments represent the net present value of future payments dependent on the future performance of each satellite and are recognised in space segment assets when the satellite becomes operational.
The associated liability is stated at its net present value and included within liabilities.
These space segment assets are depreciated over the life of the satellites from the date they become operational and are placed into service.
Borrowing costs attributable to the construction of assets which take a substantial period of time to get ready for intended use qualifying assets are added to the costs of those assets.
Assets in course of construction Assets in course of construction primarily relate to the Alphasat satellite, Inmarsat-5 satellites and Global Xpress service infrastructure.
These assets will be transferred to space segment assets and depreciated over the life of the satellites or services once they become operational and placed into service.
No depreciation has yet been charged on these assets.
Other fixed assets Other fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation Depreciation is calculated to write off the historical cost less residual values, if any, of fixed assets, except land, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The Group selects its depreciation rates and residual values carefully and reviews them annually to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
Asset retirement obligations The fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible property, plant and equipment is recognised in the financial statements in the period in which the liability is incurred.
Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, a corresponding asset retirement cost is added to the carrying amount of the related asset, which is subsequently amortised to income over the remaining useful life of the asset.
Following the initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the carrying amount of the liability is increased for the passage of time by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability with a corresponding accretion cost reflected in operating expenses.
Revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are recognised each period as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset retirement obligation.
68 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements Government grants Government grants have been received in relation to the purchase and construction of certain assets.
Government grants are deducted from the cost of the relevant assets to arrive at the carrying amount.
The grants are therefore recognised as income over the lives of the assets by way of a reduced depreciation charge.
Gains and losses on disposals of tangible and intangible assets Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing net proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill, patents, trademarks, software, terminal development costs, spectrum rights, orbital slots and licences, customer relationships and intellectual property.
Intangible assets arise from separate purchases and acquisitions as part of business combinations.
In addition, internally-generated intangible assets are recognised only if all the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Development costs directly relating to the development of new services are capitalised as intangible assets.
Costs are capitalised once a business case has been demonstrated as to technical feasibility and commercial viability.
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the asset and the amortisation period and method are reviewed each financial year.
Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are reviewed annually for impairment.
Impairment of non-financial assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, an impairment review is conducted.
Intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Impairment testing involves a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Fair value less costs to sell is calculated by reference to the amount at which the asset could be disposed of.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market-based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
CGUs are identified as groups of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate cash flows that are largely independent of other cash flow streams.
The assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the cash flows and an appropriate proportion of corporate assets.
An impairment loss is recognised in the Income Statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The carrying amount will only be increased where an impairment loss recognised in a previous period for an asset other than goodwill either no longer exists or has decreased, up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
Any impairment to goodwill recognised in a previous period is not reversed.
Investments Investments in equity instruments that do not have quoted market prices in active markets are recorded at cost.
Investments are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value and reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in other operating costs when there is objective evidence that trade receivables are impaired.
Larger accounts are specifically reviewed to assess a customers ability to make payments.
Leases Leases where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases by the lessee.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of thelease.
Interest and finance costs Interest on borrowings and other financial liabilities is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest method.
The accretion of the discount on the principal on the Convertible Bonds is accounted for as an interest expense.
Borrowing costs attributable to qualifying assets are subsequently added to the costs of those assets.
Inmarsat plc 69 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Principal accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined by the weighted average cost method and net realisable value.
Allowances for obsolescence are recognised in other operating costs when there is objective evidence that inventory is obsolete.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents, measured at fair value, include cash in hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown as current liabilities within borrowings on the Balance Sheet.
Provisions Provisions, other than in respect of pension and post-employment benefits, are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefits arising from past events and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are not recognised unless the outflow of economic benefits to settle the obligation is more likely than not to occur.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised as proceeds received, net of transaction and arrangement costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Transaction and arrangement costs of borrowings and the difference between the proceeds and the redemption value are recognised in the Income Statement over the life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.
Convertible bonds Convertible bonds that can be converted into share capital at the option of the holder are considered and accounted for as compound financial instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for a similar non-convertible debt instrument.
The embedded call and put options, since they are closely linked to the underlying instrument, are valued and recognised as part of the liability.
The total liability is recognised on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
The equity component initially brought to account is determined by deducting the amount of the liability component from the fair value of the compound instrument as a whole and represents the option for the holder to convert the bonds into equity of the company.
This conversion option is recognised and included directly in equity and is not subsequently remeasured.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components based on their respective carrying amounts at the date of issue.
On conversion, the liability is reclassified to equity and no gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement.
Where the convertible borrowing is redeemed early or repurchased in a way that does not alter the original conversion privileges, the consideration paid is allocated to the liability and equity components.
The consideration relating to the equity component is recognised in equity and the amount of gain or loss relating to the liability element is recognised in the Income Statement.
The finance costs recognised in respect of the convertible borrowings includes the accretion of the liability component to the amount that will be payable on redemption.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure used by analysts and investors, and is defined as profit before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation, loss on disposal of assets, acquisition-related adjustments, impairment losses and share of profit of associates.
Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups operations and significant debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using forward exchange contracts to limit exposure to foreign currency risk and interest rate swaps to reduce the impact of fluctuating interest rates on its floating rate long-term debt.
The Board of Directors has delegated to a sub-committee, the Treasury Review Committee, the responsibility for setting the financial risk management policies applied by the Group.
The policies are implemented by the treasury department which receives regular reports from the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The treasury department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines for managing foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk see note 32.
The management of the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.
70 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The functional currency of Inmarsat plc is the US Dollar.
The Groups long-term borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, the majority of its revenue is earned in US Dollars and the vast majority of capital expenditure is denominated in US Dollars, which are therefore not subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign currency rates of exchange.
However, approximately 50% 2011: 50% of Inmarsat Globals operating costs are denominated in Pounds Sterling.
Inmarsat Solutions operates internationally, resulting in approximately 9% and 16% of revenue and expenditure, respectively, being denominated in currencies other than the US Dollar.
The Groups exposures therefore need to be carefully managed to avoid variability in future cash flows and earnings caused by volatile foreign exchange rates.
The foreign currency hedging policy of the Group is to economically hedge a minimum of 50% of anticipated foreign currency exposure in operating expenses for the next 12 months and up to a maximum of 100% for the next three years on a rolling basis.
As at 31December2012 it is estimated that: A hypothetical 1% inflation of the hedged US Dollar Sterling exchange rate US$1.48 1.00 to US$1.49 1.00 would have decreased the 2012 profit before tax by approximately US$0.9m 2011: US$1.1m : A hypothetical 1% inflation of the US Dollar Sterling foreign currency spot rate at 31December2012, would have reduced the 2012 profit before tax by approximately US$0.2m 2011: US$0.2m, primarily as a result of the translation of Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
This analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts the translation of these items at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates: and A hypothetical 1% deflation in the US Dollar Sterling and a 1% deflation in the US Dollar Euro foreign currency spot rates at 31December2012, would have decreased equity by US$1.0m and US0.6m, respectively 2011: US$1.0m and US$1.0m, respectively primarily as a result of the changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
Management believes that a 1% sensitivity rate provides a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in foreign exchange rates.
ii Price risk The Group is not exposed to significant equity securities price risk or commodity price risk.
b Interest rate risk Given the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets except cash and cash equivalents, income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The EIB Facility is at a variable rate whilst the Senior Notes due 2017, the Convertible Bonds and the Ex-Im Facility are at fixed rates.
The policy of the Group is to ensure certainty of the interest charge by fixing interest rates on 60%100% of forecast net debt for the next two years on a rolling basis.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specific intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
As at 31December2012, if interest rates on net borrowings changed by 1%, with all other variables held constant, the Groups profit after tax for the year would have been impacted by US$2.7m 2011: US$2.1m.
This is primarily due to the Groups exposure to movements on interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the liability outstanding at each balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
Management believes that a 1% sensitivity rate provides a reasonable basis upon which to assess expected changes in interest rates.
c Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables, other receivables, accrued income and derivative financial instruments.
The credit risk on liquid funds cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are highly rated financial institutions.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is: As at As at 31 December 31 December US$ in millions Note 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 16 332.1 183.5 Trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income 17 262.6 231.0 Derivative financial instruments 32 6.4 7.9 Total credit risk 601.1 422.4 Inmarsat plc 71 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3.
Financial risk management continued The Groups average age of trade receivables as at 31December2012 excluding the impact of LightSquared was approximately 58days as at 31December2011: 50 days.
At 31 December 2012, US$156.5m 2011: US$139.3m of trade receivables were not yet due for payment.
No interest is charged on trade receivables until the receivables become overdue for payment.
Thereafter, interest may be charged at varying rates depending on the terms of the individual agreements.
The Group has credit evaluation, approval and monitoring processes intended to mitigate potential credit risks, and utilises both internal and third party collection processes for overdue accounts.
The Group maintains provisions for potential credit losses that are assessed on an ongoing basis.
The following table sets out the Groups provision for uncollectable trade receivables and revenue adjustments: US$ in millions 2012 2011 As at 1 January: 11.2 11.2 Charged to the provision in respect of the current year 13.8 10.3 Utilised in the year 6.5 9.6 Provision released in the year 0.2 0.7 a As at 31 December 18.3 11.2 a The maturity of the Groups provision for uncollectable trade receivables and revenue adjustments for the year ended 31December 2012 is US$2.1m current, US$2.9m between 1 and 30 days overdue, US$6.5m between 31 and 120 days overdue and US$6.8m over 120 days overdue 2011: US$2.9m, US$2.5m, US$2.4m and US$3.4mrespectively.
For 2012, one 2011: one distribution partner, which is reported in the Inmarsat Global segment, comprised approximately 16.2% 2011: 16.7% of the Groups total revenues.
This same customer comprised 19.7% 2011: 24.0% of the Groups trade receivables balance as at 31December2012.
No other customer accounted for 10% or more of the Groups revenue and accounts receivable at 31December2012.
In addition, for 2012, revenue from our Cooperation Agreement with LightSquared made up approximately 4.5% 2011: 14.5% of the Groups total revenues.

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and short-term deposits and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the Balance Sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The more significant estimates are discussed below: a Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group annually undertakes tests to determine whether goodwill has suffered any impairment, in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 14.
72 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements For the purpose of testing for impairment, goodwill is specifically allocated to one of four CGUs which have been identified, being Inmarsat Global, Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip.
It has been determined that goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Inmarsat Ventures Limited represented goodwill of the Inmarsat Global CGU only.
Goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip has been allocated to the Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip CGU, respectively.
As at 31December2012, the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the Inmarsat Global, Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip CGUs was US$406.2m, US$76.8m, US$34.2m and US$33.5m, respectively 2011: US$406.2m, US$142.5m, US$27.2m and US$66.6m, respectively.
During 2012, the Stratos CGU sold its Stratos Government Services Inc. business to the Segovia CGU.
As a result, US$7.0m of goodwill was reallocated from the Stratos CGU to the Segovia CGU.
Goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the CGU with its value in use.
The key assumptions used in calculating the value in use are as follows: Recoverable amount The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on the value in use, which is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by management covering a five-year period.
They reflect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Growth rates Long-term growth rates of between 2.5%3.0% 2011: 2.5%3.0% have been applied to extrapolate the cash flows into perpetuity.
The growth rate has been determined using long-term historical growth rates of the CGU and managements conservative expectation of future growth.
Discount rates The pre-tax rates used to discount the cash flow projections in respect of the Group for 2012 were between 9.76% 12.72% 2011:11.6%17.2%.
The discount rates reflect the time value of money and are derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for the risk associated with each individual CGU.
An impairment charge of US$94.7m in respect of goodwill was recorded in the year ended 31December 2012 2011: US$120.0m.
This loss related to the partial impairment of the goodwill that was originally recognised when the Group acquired the Stratos and Ship Equip businesses impairment of US$58.7m and US$36.0m, respectively.
Operating profit forecasts for the Stratos and Ship Equip CGUs have been adjusted downwards due to both internal and external factors.
Internally, the Group has made certain business decisions during the year which will affect the future profitability of each CGU, but with offsetting benefits elsewhere in the Inmarsat Group.
In relation to the Stratos CGU, the Group has appointed a number of significant service providers as distribution partners of the Inmarsat Global segment for Global Xpress, therefore redirecting future revenues to the Inmarsat Global segment that would previously have been forecast as received in the Stratos CGU.
In addition, certain revenue development plans for value-added services are now expected to be progressed within the Inmarsat Global segment and therefore not contribute to the Stratos CGU.
For the Ship Equip CGU, the Group now intends for Ship Equip to become a Value-Added Reseller for Global Xpress, which carries lower margins at the CGU level than its historic standalone VSAT business.
Externally, the management has considered two further factors in its CGU forecasts.
Firstly, the Group has seen delays in purchase decision-making for maritime VSAT systems, impacting the Ship Equip CGU.
The management believes these delays are due to ship operators preferring to wait for the launch of our GX services in order to compare GX to existing VSAT alternatives.
Secondly, for the Stratos GCU there has been a decline in demand for certain products throughout 2012 resulting from reduced military activities in Afghanistan and reduced event-driven traffic and termination of some lease business.
The combination of these factors is expected to result in reduced operating profits at the Inmarsat Solutions level and have therefore been reflected in the revised forecasts, giving rise to the impairment of the Stratos and Ship Equip CGUs.
In Group terms, some of the factors that give rise to the impairment at the Inmarsat Solutions level have an offsetting positive benefit at the Inmarsat Global level and should not give rise to an equivalent gross impact at the Group level.
A long-term growth rate of 2.5% was applied to extrapolate the Stratos and Ship Equip CGU cash flow projections into perpetuity and a pre-tax discount rate of 12.72% was used to discount the cash flow projections.
The US$120.0m impairment charge in respect of the Stratos CGU in the year ended 31 December 2011 also related to operating profit forecasts for the Stratos CGU being adjusted downwards due to both internal and external factors.
The changes in prices between Inmarsat Global and the distribution channel were not passed onto the end customers of Stratos, resulting in reduced margins for the Stratos CGU.
In addition, commitments under our LightSquared Cooperation Agreement resulted in the expected discontinuance of certain customer leases for Inmarsat B, and certain other services which directly impacted the Stratos CGU.
While this business was expected to be partly retained through agreements using non-lease services, these are at a lower margin.
There was also a reduction in Inmarsat MSS revenues, changes in product mix and competitive pricing, all of which contributed to lower than expected revenues.
In 2011, a long-term growth rate of 2.5% was applied to extrapolate the Stratos CGU cash flow projections into perpetuity and a pre-tax discount rate of 13.8% was used to discount the cash flow projections.
b Pension arrangements and post-employment benefits assumptions The Group has applied a weighted average rate of return on assets of 6.68% p. a.
2011: 6.65% p. a. which represents the expected return on asset holdings in the future.
The weighted average discount rate used to calculate the pension and post-employment benefits liabilities was 4.60% 2011: 4.74% see note 28.
Inmarsat plc 73 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies continued c Income tax The Groups income tax balance is the sum of the total current and deferred tax balances.
The calculation of this, and of the Groups potential liabilities or assets, necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority, or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
Issues can, and often do, take a number of years to resolve.
The amounts recognised or disclosed are derived from the Groups best estimation and judgement.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these means eventual realisation could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and cash flows.
A contingent liability has been disclosed for the year ended 31 December 2012 in respect of the financing of a finance and operating leaseback transaction entered into in 2007 see note 34. d Revenue in respect of the LightSquared Cooperation Agreement In December 2007, Inmarsat and LightSquared LP, Skyterra Canada Inc. and LightSquared Inc. together LightSquared entered into a Cooperation Agreement for the efficient use of L-band spectrum over North America.
The Cooperation Agreement was segregated into phases and designed to enable and support the deployment of an ATC network by LightSquared in North America.
To date, LightSquared has made payments under the agreement totalling US$546.4m, of which US$85.8m has been received during 2012 2011: US$308.1m.
The Group has, thus far, recognised US$281.5m of revenue and US$19.9m of operating costs under all phases of the agreement.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group recognised US$60.2m of revenue and US$8.3m of operating costs, in respect of all phases year ended 31 December 2011: US$203.8m and US$11.2m, respectively.
On 20 April 2012, Inmarsat and LightSquared reached an agreement to suspend the Cooperation Agreement until 31 March 2014.
The period of suspension is designed to allow LightSquared time to secure certain regulatory consents and, during this period, LightSquared will not be required to make any further payments to Inmarsat.
On 1 April 2014, or any earlier date as may be required or elected by LightSquared, payments under the agreement will recommence from that date based on a restructured payment plan that will be dependent on certain future outcomes with regard to deployment of the LightSquared ATC network.
In connection with our accounting for different phases of the Cooperation Agreement, we have used the accounting method considered most appropriate to the individual phase, including the percentage of completion method and straight line method in the case of both revenues and costs.
Where the percentage of completion method was used, we have had to measure the number of man-hours undertaken against our estimate of the total man-hours required to complete the phase or activity.
Similarly, we have measured costs incurred against our estimate of the total costs required to complete the phase or activity.
The key area of estimation uncertainty relates to the Directors estimates of the total time costs that will be incurred and the Directors estimate of the percentage of completion of the time and costs that the Group has incurred.
Segmental information IFRS 8, Operating Segments, requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM to allocate resources and assess performance.
The CODM of Inmarsat plc is the Chief Executive Officer who is responsible for assessing the performance of the individual segments.
Information reported to the CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is specifically focused on the individual performance of each of the divisions within the Group, namely Inmarsat Global and Inmarsat Solutions.
The Groups reportable segments are therefore as follows: Inmarsat Global principally the supply of wholesale airtime, equipment and services to distribution partners and other wholesale partners of mobile satellite communications by the Inmarsat Global business, including entering into spectrum coordination agreements.
The segment also includes income from technical support to other operators, the provision of conference facilities and leasing surplus office space to external organisations, all of which are not material on a standalone basis and in aggregate: Inmarsat Solutions the supply of advanced mobile and fixed-site remote telecommunications services, the provision of customised turnkey remote telecommunications solutions, value-added services, equipment and engineering services to service providers and end-users: and Unallocated includes Group borrowings and the related interest expense, cash and cash equivalents and current and deferred tax balances, which are not allocated to each segment.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in note 2.
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of investment revenue, finance costs and income tax expense.

Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
At 31December 2012, the Directors believe the goodwill in relation to the Stratos and Ship Equip CGUs to be impaired and consequently have recorded impairment charges of US$58.7m 2011: US$120.0m and US$36.0m 2011: US$nil, respectively, in the Income Statement see note 4 a.
Patents and trademarks are being amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are seven years and between seven and 20 years, respectively.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, an impairment loss of US$21.5m was recognised in the Income Statement to reduce the carrying amount of the Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip trade names to US$nil.
During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group comprised Inmarsat, Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip, all acting as relatively independent business units.
From 1 January 2012, Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip were rebranded as Inmarsat and therefore the previous trade names are no longer used and were impaired.
The capitalised software relates to the Groups BGAN billing system and other internally developed operational systems and purchased software and is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three to 12 years.
Internally developed technology acquired as a result of the acquisition of Stratos is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of five years.
The Group capitalises development costs associated with the development of user terminals as intangible fixed assets.
Costs directly relating to the development of the user terminals for the BGAN and GSPS services are being amortised over the estimated sales life of the services which is five to 10 years.
Customer relationships acquired in connection with Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip are being amortised over the expected period of benefit of between 12 and 14 years, using the straight-line method.
Spectrum rights relate to the acquisition of ACeS and Stratos.
Spectrum rights acquired as a result of the ACeS collaboration in September 2006 are being amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful lives of two years.
Spectrum rights acquired as a result of the acquisition of Stratos are being amortised over their useful lives of three to 10 years.
Orbital slots and licences relate to the Global Xpress programme and other licences acquired.
Each individual asset is reviewed to determine whether it has a finite or indefinite useful life, amortisation of the Global Xpress programme finite life assets will commence when the Inmarsat-5 satellites are operational.
Indefinite life assets will be tested annually for impairment.
Intellectual property relates to the acquisition of ACeS and is now fully amortised.

c On 15 April 2010, the Group signed an eight-year facility agreement from the European Investment Bank the EIB Facility.
Under the agreement, the Group was able to borrow up to 225m at any time before 23December 2010.
The facility was available in Euros and US Dollars.
An initial drawdown of US$180.0m was made on 30April 2010 and a final drawdown of US$128.4m was made on 28 October 2010.
This facility matures on 30April 2018 and is repayable in equal annual instalments on both tranches beginning 30 April 2012.
Interest is equal to three-month USD LIBOR plus a margin, payable in April, July, October and January each year.
d On 16November2007, the Group issued US$287.7m in principal amount of 1.75% convertible bonds due 2017 the Convertible Bonds.
The bonds are convertible into ordinary shares of the Company and have a 1.75% per annum coupon payable semi-annually and a yield to maturity of 4.50%.
The bonds have an initial conversion premium of 32.5% over the reference share price of 4.6193 representing approximately 5% of the Companys current issued share capital.
The initial conversion price was US$12.694 and the total number of common shares to be issued if all bonds are converted was 22.7 million shares.
The conversion price is subject to periodic adjustment if dividends paid on ordinary shares exceed defined levels.
In 2012, the conversion price was adjusted to US$12.490 and the total number of shares to be issued if all bonds are converted to 23.0 million shares.
The Company will have an option to call the bonds after seven years at their accreted principal amount under certain circumstances.
In addition, the holder of each bond had the right to require the Company to redeem the bonds at the accreted principal amount on 16November 2012 and will have the right again on 16November 2014.
None of the bonds were redeemed on 16 November 2012: as a result management have revised the estimated maturity date to November 2014.
The amortised cost has been adjusted and as at 31 December 2012 the Convertible Bonds have been recorded as a long-term liability.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the Convertible Bonds were initially split into a liability component of US$224.3m and an equity component of US$56.9m.
The equity component represents the fair value of the option to convert the liability into equity of the Group as follows: US$ in millions Fair value of Convertible Bonds issued 287.7 Cost of issue 6.5 Net proceeds 281.2 1 Equity component 56.9 2 Liability component at date of issue 224.3 Cumulative interest charged to 31December2011 101.3 Cumulative amortisation of debt issue costs to 31December2011 3.8 Cumulative coupon interest accrued to 31December2011 20.6 Liability component at 31December2011 308.8 Interest charged 0.9 Amortisation of debt issue costs 0.7 Coupon interest accrued 5.0 Liability component at 31 December 2012 302.2 1 Net of capitalised issue costs of US$1.3m.

82 Inmarsat plc AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 2012 Operations Governance Financial statements The interest charged for the year is calculated by applying an effective interest rate of 9.88% to the liability component.
The total interest charge is split between the coupon interest charge of US$5.0m and accreted interest of US$29.3m, which has been adjusted in 2012 by US$30.2m following the revised maturity of the Convertible Bonds.
The coupon interest is paid semi-annually in May and November each year until maturity.
Similarly, the bonds accrete semi-annually in May and November each year until maturity.
e On 12November2009, the Group issued US$650.0m aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Notes due 1December 2017 Senior Notes due 2017.
The aggregate gross proceeds were US$645.2m, net of US$4.8m issuance discount and the Group capitalised US$12.5m of issuance costs.
On 11 April 2012, a further US$200.0m aggregate principal amount of the Groups Senior Notes due 2017 was issued.
The aggregate proceeds were US$212.0m, including US$12.0m premium on issuance and the Group capitalised US$3.8m of issuance costs.
f On 11 May 2011, the Group signed a 12.5-year US$700.0m direct financing agreement with the Export-Import Bank of the United States the Ex-Im Bank Facility.
The facility has a total availability period of four years and will then be repayable in equal instalments over a further 8.5 years.
Drawings under the facility incur interest at a fixed rate of 3.11% for the life of the loan.
g O n 30 June 2011, the Group signed a five-year US$750.0m Senior Credit Facility with a group of commercial banks as lenders.
Under the terms of the facility the full US$750.0m amount is available to draw in the form of a revolving credit facility and does not amortise during the five-year availability period.
Advances under the facility bear interest at a rate equal to the applicable USD LIBOR, plus a margin of between 1.00% and 2.50% determined by reference to the Groups ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
As at 31 December 2012 and 2011 there were no drawings on the Senior Credit Facility.
The maturity of non-current borrowings is as follows: As at As at 31 December 31 December US$ in millions 2012 2011 Between one and two years 360.3 47.0 Between two and five years 1,116.7 202.5 After five years 292.0 939.4 1,769.0 1,188.9 The borrowings of the Group are mostly at fixed rates.
The Senior Notes due 2017, Convertible Bonds and the Ex-Im Bank Facility are at fixed rates.
The Directors consider the carrying value of borrowings, other than the Senior Notes due 2017 and Convertible Bonds to approximate to their fair value see note 32.

The Trustee and the Company have agreed that to reduce the Pension Plan the Plan deficit additional annual contributions of 2.2m will be paid to the Plan starting in November 2009 and continuing annually thereafter, up to and including November 2015.
During 2012, the actual additional cash contribution the Group made to the Plan was 6.0m or US$9.6m 2011: US$5.4m.
As a result of the additional contributions in the year the Plan is no longer in a deficit position, therefore no further additional cash contributions are expected under the agreement.
Asset retirement obligations have been recognised in respect of the expected costs of removal of equipment from leased premises by Inmarsat Solutions.

Current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities The current income tax liability of US$32.7m 2011: US$52.3m represents the income tax payable in respect of current and prior periods less amounts paid.
Recognised deferred income tax assets and liabilities The movements in deferred income tax assets and liabilities prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12 during the year are shown below.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.

The unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries affected by such taxes is US$5.2m 2011:US$4.6m.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on these temporary differences as the Group is able to control the timing of reversal and it is probable that this will not take place in the foreseeable future.
On 22 June 2010, the UK government announced reductions in the main rate of corporation tax and rates of capital allowances.
Thestandard rate of corporation tax was reduced from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 and there will be further reductions until a rate of 21% is reached with effect from 1 April 2014.
The Finance Act 2012 received Royal Assent on 17 July 2012, with the rate reduction to 23% being substantively enacted from 3 July 2012.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are calculated at the substantively enacted rate of 23%.
Whilst detailed calculations have not been prepared at this stage, it is estimated that the impact of the remaining annual corporation tax rate reductions would reduce the value of the Groups deferred tax liabilities at the balance sheet date by approximately US$18.5m and reduce the value of the Groups deferred tax assets at the balance sheet date by approximately US$1.2m.

Employee share options and awards In line with IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, the Group recognised US$10.8m 2011: US$13.0m in total share compensation costs across all of its share plans for the 2012 financial year.
Total share-based compensation costs are recognised over the vesting period of the options and share awards ranging from one to four years.
All options granted under the Staff Value Participation Plan the 2004 Plan have now vested and are exercisable.
Whenever options are exercised under the 2004 Plan, the holder must pay a fide minimis charge of 1 for each tranche of options exercised.
The options expire 10 years from the date of grant.
Shares are transferred to the optionholders from the Inmarsat Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust resident in Guernsey.
No new shares have been issued to satisfy the exercise of these options.

The Company also operates a Bonus Share Plan BSP.
Awards have been made regularly under the BSP to the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management and details of the awards made to the Executive Directors in 2012 are provided in the Remuneration Report.
Awards are made in the form of a conditional allocation of shares.
The performance conditions attached to the BSP are non-market based performance conditions.
Dividends will accrue and be added as additional shares upon vesting.
Details of the operation of the BSP can be found in the Remuneration Report.
The rules of the BSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is, however, the intention of the Company to generally satisfy the awards using newly-issued shares.
As the BSP provides free share awards with no market-based performance conditions attached, and which carry an entitlement to dividends paid in cash or shares during the vesting period, the fair value of the awards is the value of the grant.
This is due to the fact that regardless of the market price at the time the award of shares is made, the total value of shares to be awarded excluding shares added in lieu of dividends will not change.
The Company also operates a Performance Share Plan PSP and regular annual awards are made to the Executive Directors and certain members of senior management.
Details of awards made to the Executive Directors under the PSP in 2012 are provided in the Remuneration Report.
Participants are entitled to receive the value of any dividends that are paid between the date of award to the date of vesting in the form of additional shares.
Any such additional shares are only added to the number of shares which will vest subject to performance conditions being satisfied.
The PSP shares will not normally be transferred to participants until the third anniversary of the award date.
The transfer of shares is dependent upon the performance conditions being satisfied over the three consecutive financial years starting in the financial year the award date falls.
The rules of the PSP provide that the Remuneration Committee has the discretion to satisfy the awards using cash instead of shares.
It is, however, the intention of the Company to satisfy the awards using newly-issued shares at the end of the relevant three-year period.
The performance conditions for the PSP are based on the Groups Total Shareholder Return TSR relative to constituents of the FTSE 350 Index excluding investment trusts and a non-market based condition, based on EBITDA measured over a three-year period.
The vesting schedule for PSP awards up to and including the award made in 2011 is determined by a combination of TSR and EBITDA performance.
For the award made in March 2012, the vesting schedule is structured so that 50% of the reward is linked to the performance of TSR and EBITDA as individual performance measures.

Earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share Basic earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share trust, which are treated as cancelled, and after taking account of the restructuring of the existing share capital.

Currently the underlying shares in relation to the share options and awards in relation to employee share plans are the only categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
A calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options and awards and value of related future employee services.

Pension arrangements and post-employment benefits The Group operates pension schemes in each of its principal locations.
The Groups pension plans are provided through both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution arrangements.
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Norway.
The Groups principal defined benefit pension scheme is the UK scheme for Inmarsat Global, which is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate fund administered by a corporate trustee: the scheme is closed to new employees.
The Inmarsat Global defined benefit plan was valued using the projected unit credit method with thevaluation undertaken by professionally qualified and independent actuaries as at 31December2011.
The results of the valuation have been updated for any material transactions and material changes in circumstances including changes in market prices and interest rates up to 31December2012.
The results of this updated valuation as at 31December2012, for the purposes of the additional disclosures required by IAS 19, are set out below.
The Group also provides post-employment benefits for some of its employees.
The Groups principal scheme is Inmarsat Globals post-retirement healthcare benefit scheme, which is the provision of healthcare to retired employees and their dependants who were employed before 1 January 1998.
Employees who have 10 years of service at the age of 58 and retire are eligible to participate in the post-retirement healthcare benefit plans.
Membership of this plan is multinational, although most staff are currently employed in the UK.
The plans are self-funded and there are no plan assets from which the costs are paid.
The cost of providing these benefits is actuarially determined and accrued over the service period of the active employee groups.
Schemes denominated in local currencies are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between US Dollars and local currencies.
The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the Groups pension and post-employment benefits liabilities under IAS19 are: As at 31 As at 31 December December 2012 2011 Weighted average actuarial assumptions used at 31 December: Discount rate 4.60% 4.74% Expected return on plan assets 6.68% 6.65% Future salary increases 3.05% 4.55% a Medical cost trend rate 3.60% 3.70% Future pension increases 2.93% 3.09% a With effect from 1 January 2012, an inflationary cap on premiums for the post-retirement healthcare benefits was introduced, set at CPI plus 1%.
The Group will pay the annual premium and any increase in percentage terms to the premium, up to a percentage amount capped at no more than CPI plus 1%.
Any increase to the annual premium above the inflationary cap will be payable by the members of the scheme.
Mortality assumptions have been updated to reflect experience and expected changes in future improvements in life expectancy.
The average life expectancy assumptions for the Companys pension and post-employment benefits liabilities are as follows: 2012 2011 Number Number of years of years Male current age 65 88.0 87.4 Female current age 65 89.9 90.3 Mortality assumptions used are consistent with those recommended by the individual scheme actuaries and reflect the latest available tables, adjusted for the experience of the Group where appropriate.
For the Inmarsat Global defined benefit pension scheme and the Inmarsat Global post-retirement healthcare benefits for 2012 and 2011, mortality has been assumed to follow the SAPS Series 1 Normal Health tables, with long cohort improvements from 2003 based on year of birth, subject to minimum funding improvements of 1% per annum.

Inmarsat plc 93 AnnuAl report And Accounts 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 28.
Pension arrangements and post-employment benefits continued The healthcare cost trend rate assumption for Inmarsat Globals post-retirement healthcare benefits has a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Income Statement in respect of the post-retirement medical benefits.
Increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31December2012 by US$3.5m 2011: US$3.5m and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by US$0.2m 2011: US$0.8m.
Decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have reduced the post-retirement medical benefit obligation as of 31December2012 by US$2.7m 2011: US$2.7m, and the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by US$0.2m 2011: US$0.6m.
Acquisitions Acquisition of NewWave Broadband Limited On 13 January 2012, the Group acquired all of the outstanding and issued common shares of NewWave Broadband Limited for a total consideration of US$7.7m net of cash acquired.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
Goodwill recognised on this acquisition amounts to US$2.9m.
Acquisition of Ship Equip On 28 April 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Ship Equip for a total cash consideration of US$113.2m net of cash acquired and after hedging the foreign exchange risk.
The allocation of the purchase consideration was finalised during the year ended 31 December 2011.
The revenue included in the Income Statement for the year ended 31December 2011, contributed by Ship Equip since the acquisition date, was US$42.1m.
Ship Equip also contributed a loss after tax of US$1.6m, during the year ended 31 December 2011.
Ship Equips contribution to revenue and profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2011, assuming the transaction had occurred on 1January 2011, would have been US$60.3m and a loss of US$4.6m, respectively.
Acquisition of Segovia In the year ending 31 December 2011, the Inmarsat plc Group comprised Inmarsat, Stratos, Segovia and Ship Equip all operating as relatively independent business units.
Effective from 1 January 2012, the Group has been operating with business units aligned to vertical market sectors as part of Inmarsat Solutions.
The original acquisition of Segovia on 12 January 2010 involved an element of deferred consideration.
To enable effective operation of the new Inmarsat Government US business unit, in December 2011, the majority of the remaining value of the contingent deferred consideration on the Segovia acquisition relating to the calendar years ending 31December 2011 and 2012 was settled ahead of the scheduled payout dates in 2012 and 2013.
As a result of accelerating the settlement of the deferred consideration, the Group recorded an additional charge of US$5.6m in the 2011 Income Statement, in line with IFRS 3.
US$2.1m of the charge represents the better than expected performance in 2011 and was recorded in the acquisition-related adjustments line in the Income Statement and US$3.5m was recorded in interest payable, representing the effect of the acceleration of the settlement of the liability ahead of schedule.
Acquisition of Blue Ocean Wireless In addition, in July 2011, the Group acquired most of the operational assets of Blue Ocean Wireless BOW for a total consideration of US$3.4m.

The Group continually evaluates sources of capital and may repurchase, refinance, exchange or retire current or future borrowings and or debt securities from time to time in private or open-market transactions, or by any other means permitted by the terms and conditions of borrowing facilities and debt securities.
Additionally, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group uses a maximum ratio of net borrowings to EBITDA as an internal planning parameter and in regular forecasting and monitoring activities.
In addition, movements in cash and borrowings as well as total available liquidity are monitored regularly.
The net borrowing gross of deferred finance costs to EBITDA ratio for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 2.19 2011: 1.63.
The Groups liquidity is disclosed in note 3 d. No changes were made in the Groups objectives, policies or processes for managing capital in the years ended 31December 2012 and 2011.
Financial instruments Treasury management and strategy The Groups treasury activities are managed by its corporate finance department under the direction of a Treasury Review Committee whose chairman is the Chief Financial Officer, and are consistent with Board-approved treasury policies and guidelines.
The overriding objective of treasury activities is to manage financial risk.
Key features of treasury management include: ensuring that the Group is in a position to fund its obligations in appropriate currencies as they fall due: maintaining adequate undrawn borrowing facilities: economically hedging both contracted and anticipated foreign currency cash flows on a minimum 12 months rolling basis with the option of covering exposures up to a maximum of three years forward: interest rate hedging: and maximising return on short-term investments based on counterparty limits and credit ratings.
Treasury activities are only transacted with counterparties who are approved relationship banks.
Treasury foreign exchange policy is implemented primarily through the use of forward purchases of foreign currencies.
The treasury department is, however, authorised to use purchased options, futures and other derivative instruments, but only to the extent that such instruments form part of the hedging policy so as to establish a known rate of exchange.
Having arranged the purchase of foreign currency in line with the anticipated requirement for that currency over each financial year, an average rate of exchange is calculated from the agreed currency transactions.

This carrying amount approximately equals fair value see note 19 : The Senior Notes due 2017 are reflected in the Balance Sheet as at 31December2012 net of unamortised arrangement costs and net issuance premium of US$11.0m and US$7.5m 2011: US$9.2m and US$3.6m of unamortised arrangement costs and net issuance discount, respectively, respectively see note 19.
