Although cash flows have been identified for certain individual plants for the purposes of assessing the recoverable amounts, the non-food systems business is principally managed as a network in the United States and Europe, with a large amount of interdependency between plants with plants servicing both the Speciality Food Ingredients and Bulk Ingredients segments.
As a result, except as noted, it is not possible to allocate goodwill to either the Bulk Ingredients or the Speciality Food Ingredients segments.
Therefore, goodwill is tested for impairment on a geographical basis except where goodwill can be allocated to an identifiable separate CGU.
Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in Notes 2 and 3 using cash flows based on the latest Board approved management projections with management determined budgeted gross margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and are based on the Groups WACC adjusted to reflect specific risks relating to the relevant operating segments.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The terminal value is based on the long term growth rate for the relevant geographical markets and is approximately 2% or lower per year.
a G oodwill within the Speciality Food Ingredients segment includes 45 million 2011 48 million relating to the acquisition of G. C. Hahn & Co. in June 2007, 17 million 2011 18 million relating to the acquisition of the Cesalpinia Foods group in December 2005 and 12 million 2011 12 million relating to the acquisition of Continental Custom Ingredients in January 2006 which are all within the Food Systems division.
These businesses have been tested for impairment using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.4% 2011 11% with cash flow projections based on the 5 year business plan.
A 2% growth was assumed in perpetuity based on the long term national average growth rates for the geographic markets these businesses operate in.
Management has concluded that no impairment is required.
The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management projections for five years, pre-tax discount rates of 10.4% 2011 11%, and a 2% growth assumed in perpetuity based on long-term national average growth rate for these markets.
Significant headroom exists and management has concluded that no impairment is required.
