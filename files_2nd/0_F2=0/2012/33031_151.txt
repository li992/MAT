Pensions The primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
With effect from 1 April 2010, BP closed its UK plan to new joiners other than some of those joining the North Sea business.
The plan remains open to those employees who joined BP on or before 31 March 2010.
The majority of new joiners in the UK have the option to join a defined contribution plan.
The obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2012.
The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main UK pension plan was as at 31 December 2011.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pensions at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2012 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2013.
Financial assumptions % 2012 2011 2010 Expected long-term rate of return 6.9 7.0 7.3 Discount rate for plan liabilities 4.4 4.8 5.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.9 5.1 5.4 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.1 3.2 3.5 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.1 3.2 3.5 Inflation 3.1 3.2 3.5 Our discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments.
The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds.
The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions.
Our assumption for the rate of increase in salaries is based on our inflation assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
This includes allowance for promotion-related salary growth of 0.7%.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
Mortality assumptions 2012 2011 2010 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 60 27.7 27.6 26.1 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.6 30.5 29.1 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.4 29.3 28.7 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 32.1 32.0 31.6 The market values of the various categories of asset held by the pension plan at 31 December are set out below.
