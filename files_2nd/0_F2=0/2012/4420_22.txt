These are depreciated over their estimated useful economic life of five years on a straight-line basis.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
The cost of awards is measured as the fair value of the award at grant date less employee contributions.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.

Retirement benets A dened contribution plan is a retirement benefit under which the Company pays xed contributions into a separate entity.
The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benets relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
A dened benefit plan is a retirement benefit that is not a dened contribution plan.
Typically, dened benefit plans define an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and salary.
In accordance with FRS 17, for dened benefit plans the liability recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for past-service costs which have not yet vested.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related retirement benefit liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised immediately in the profit and loss reserve.
For dened contribution plans, the Company pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
