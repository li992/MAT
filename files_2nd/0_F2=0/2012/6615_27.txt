Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 109 million have been made in respect of taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits retained by certain overseas subsidiaries.
No further provision is made, on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 18 billion 2011 28 billion.
The unprovided deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31 December 2012 is estimated to be 500 million 2011 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on REPATRIATION AND DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAXES LEVIED BY OVERSEAS TAX JURISDICTIONS 5 LEGISLATION RELATING TO COMPANY DISTRIBUTIONS PROVIDES for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years As a global organisation there are many factors which could affect the future effective tax rate of the Group.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, generally using five year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency specic risks.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these brands.

For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 589 million 2011 385 million, the increase primarily arising from additions and fair value adjustments.
Additions in the year include further investments in Theravance Inc. of 146 million.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

The purchase was completed in February 2013 and is discussed in Note 40, Post balance sheet events.
Customer return and rebate accruals are provided for by the Group at the point of sale in respect of the estimated rebates, discounts or allowances payable to customers, principally in the USA.
Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
Trade and other payables include 19 million 2011 16 million due to associates and joint ventures.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.

In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
The expected rate of return on equities represents the Groups long term view and includes a higher risk premium over bonds than in the past reecting current low bond yields.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the SAPS standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the CMI projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1% per year for both males and females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2032 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.4 29.6 24.8 26.4 Projected for 2032 29.0 31.2 26.7 27.5 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and the asset allocation for the UK plans has been adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The target asset allocation of the US plans is currently 50% return seeking assets and 50% liability matching assets.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
During 2012, the Group changed its policy towards granting discretionary pension increases in the Smithkline Beecham dened benefit schemes.
As a result of the change, discretionary pension increases for pensions accruing prior to 1997 will be based on increases in the Consumer Price Index instead of the Retail Price Index.
This change will also apply to revaluation of some of the deferred pensions of certain scheme participants who left service prior to 1991.
In the year, the Group has also introduced a limit for all UK dened benefit schemes of 2% per year on the rate at which pensionable pay may increase.
The consequence of this is that those benets which are related to final pensionable pay are now expected to be lower than was previously the case.
The combined impact of these two changes in 2012 is a credit to the income statement of 395 million and a similar reduction in the pension obligation.
The Group has applied the following financial assumptions in assessing the dened benefit liabilities: UK USA Rest of World 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 2.00 4.00 4.50 4.00 4.00 4.50 3.00 2.90 3.50 Discount rate 4.40 4.80 5.50 3.80 4.40 5.20 3.30 4.20 4.50 Expected pension increases 3.00 3.00 3.50 n a n a n a 1.90 1.90 2.20 Cash balance credit conversion rate n a n a n a 3.35 3.75 4.20 1.30 1.20 1.30 Ination rate 3.00 3.00 3.50 2.25 2.25 2.25 1.70 1.60 1.70 174 GSK Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued The amounts recorded in the income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the three years ended 31 December 2012 in relation to the dened benefit pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were as follows: Post-retirement benets Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2012 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 130 66 75 271 36 Past service credit cost 395 395 4 Expected return on pension scheme assets 445 131 51 627 Interest on scheme liabilities 412 123 65 600 66 Settlements and curtailments 4 4 294 58 89 147 106 Actuarial losses gains recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 448 14 228 662 119 Post-retirement benets Pensions UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2011 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 123 64 75 262 31 Past service credit 48 1 49 1 Expected return on pension scheme assets 465 136 52 653 Interest on scheme liabilities 437 134 64 635 71 Settlements and curtailments 5 1 4 5 52 61 86 199 96 Actuarial losses recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 637 97 102 836 133 Post-retirement Pensions benets UK USA Rest of World Group Group 2010 m m m m m Amounts charged to operating profit Current service cost 130 68 70 268 31 Past service cost 5 Expected return on pension scheme assets 427 134 51 612 Interest on scheme liabilities 425 151 64 640 73 Settlements and curtailments 30 30 3 57 47 158 115 80 353 156 Actuarial gains losses recorded in the statement of comprehensive income 73 43 37 79 80 The past service credit of 395 million in 2012 reects the adjustments related to the capping of future pensionable salary increases and a change in the basis of future discretionary pension increases from RPI to CPI in certain legacy plans.

In 2009, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identied at the 31 December 2008 actuarial funding valuation.
Based on the funding agreement following the 2008 valuation, the additional contributions are expected to be 368 million in 2013.
The contributions are based on a discount rate of 5.25% and an ination assumption of 2.8%.
The next review of contribution levels is in progress and will be based on the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2011.
Employer contributions for 2013, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 660 million in respect of dened benefit pension schemes and 70 million in respect of post-retirement benets.

The liability for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical ination of 7% 2011 7.5%, grading down to 5.0% in 2017 and thereafter.
During 2009, both the US pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were amended.
The changes resulted in a one-off gain of 37 million recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2012 the US post-retirement healthcare scheme obligation was 1,504 million 2011 1,446 million: 2010 1,288 million.
However, in accordance with IAS 19 the unvested part of a benefit improvement is not recognised immediately on the balance sheet but is recognised gradually through the income statement.
At 31 December 2012, for the Group, the unrecognised past service cost of 17 million 2011 21 million: 2010 34 million primarily relates to the effect of the change in the US post-retirement healthcare scheme, which amounted to 25 million 2011 31 million: 2010 36 million.
The dened benefit pension obligation is analysed as follows: 2012 2011 2010 m m m Funded 14,789 13,956 13,033 Unfunded 402 378 346 15,191 14,334 13,379 Post-retirement benets are unfunded.

Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to product liability principally relating to Avandia, Paxil and Poligrip, anti-trust principally relating to Wellbutrin, Flonase and Lamictal, government investigations principally relating to the Colorado investigation settlement, Avandia-related investigations, AWP and nominal price investigations and the Cidra, Puerto Rico manufacturing settlement, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The charge for the year of 449 million 435 million net of reversals and estimated insurance recoveries primarily related to provisions for product liability cases regarding Paxil, Poligrip and other products and various government investigations.
Various Federal government investigations were resolved in the year within the existing pre-tax provision and the after tax cost was approximately $150 million lower than provided.
As a result, a tax credit was recorded in the year.
However, due to the evolving state litigation environment, GSK utilised the tax benefit arising in recording an offsetting additional pre-tax provision of approximately $180 million equating to an after tax cost of $150 million related to these matters.
This was recorded as a legal charge in SG&A.
The net effect of these movements on total earnings was neutral.
The discount on the provisions decreased by 3 million in 2012 2011 12 million and was calculated using risk-adjusted projected cash ows and risk-free rates of return.
The movement in 2012 includes a decrease of 1 million 2011 5 million arising from a change in the discount rate in the year.
In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, there is sufficient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over many years.
Litigation proceedings, including the various appeal procedures, often take many years to reach resolution, and out-of-court settlement discussions can also often be protracted.
The Group is in potential settlement discussions in a number of the disputes for which amounts have been provided and, based on its current assessment of the progress of these disputes, estimates that 0.4 billion of the amount provided at 31 December 2012 will be settled within one year.
At 31 December 2012, it was expected that 3 million 2011 29 million of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third party insurers.
This amount is included within the Other receivables balances in Note 22, Other non-current assets and Note 24, Trade and other receivables.
For a discussion of legal issues, see Note 44 Legal proceedings.
Major restructuring programmes In October 2007 the Group announced a significant new Operational Excellence programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations see Note 10 Major restructuring costs.
Following several expansions, the estimated total costs are expected to be approximately 4.85 billion and the expanded programme is expected to deliver annual pre-tax savings of approximately 2.8 billion by the time it is substantially complete in 2014.
Provisions for staff severance payments are made when management has made a formal decision to eliminate certain positions and this has been communicated to the groups of employees affected.
No provision is made for staff severance payments that are made immediately.
Pension augmentations arising from staff redundancies of 4 million 2011 5 million have been charged during the year and then transferred to the pension obligations provision as shown in Note 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets.
Asset write-downs have been recognised as impairments of property, plant and equipment in Note 17 Property, plant and equipment.
The majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised in the next two years.
Employee related provisions Employee related provisions include certain medical benets to disabled employees and their spouses in the USA.
At 31 December 2012, the provision for these benets amounted to 113 million 2011 121 million.
Other employee benets reect a variety of provisions for severance costs, jubilee awards and other long-service benets.
Other provisions Included in other provisions is contingent consideration in respect of business acquisitions, principally of Stiefel Laboratories Inc. in 2009.
The contingent consideration is payable upon certain criteria being met by certain specified dates in the future.
The aggregate provision for these items amounts to 43 million at 31 December 2012 2011 42 million.

31 Contingent liabilities At 31 December 2012, contingent liabilities, comprising guarantees, discounted bills and other items arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 209 million 2011 205 million.
At 31 December 2012, nil 2011 1 million of financial assets were pledged as collateral for contingent liabilities.
Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outow.
At 31 December 2012, other than for those disputes where provision has been made, it was not possible to make a reliable estimate of the potential outow of funds that might be required to settle disputes where the possibility of there being an outow was more than remote.
Descriptions of the significant tax, legal and other disputes to which the Group is a party are set out in Note 14, Taxation and Note 44, Legal proceedings.

On 3 August 2012, GSK completed the acquisition of 100% of the issued share capital of Human Genome Sciences, Inc. HGS, a US based biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of protein and anti-body drugs for the treatment of immuno-inammation diseases, for cash.
The total consideration was 2,515 million and represented 251 million of cash acquired, 1,249 million of intangible assets, 791 million of goodwill and 224 million of other net assets.
The consideration comprised cash of 2,282 million and a gain of 233 million arising on the settlement of pre-existing collaborations.
The gain was recognised within Other operating income in the income statement.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of this business reects the potential business synergies and realisation of the full value of Benlysta, albiglutide, darapladib and other assets by simplifying and optimising R&D, commercial and manufacturing operations through complete ownership of the assets.
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The results of the acquired business are reported as part of the US, Europe, EMAP, Japan and Other Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines operating segments.
The transaction has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
The pro-forma turnover for the HGS business for the full year 2012 was 154 million.
Since the acquisition, GSK recorded turnover of 69 million from HGS products.
As the HGS products have been fully integrated into the GSK business, it is not practicable to separately identify the impact of the acquisition on the Group profit for the year.
Acquisition costs expensed in 2012 arising on this acquisition amounted to 28 million.

The assets acquired include the investigational medicine dolutegravir and early stage integrase inhibitor compounds.
The compounds are in development and do not currently generate revenue.
The net assets acquired comprise 1,777 million of intangible assets and 628 million of deferred tax liability.
Negative goodwill of 124 million, arising from the differing assessments of valuations between the parties, was recognised as a gain within Other operating income in the income statement.
Total consideration comprised a 10% equity stake in ViiV Healthcare valued at 377 million, the fair value of GSKs existing 50% investment in the joint venture of 256 million and contingent consideration payable in cash in the future valued at 659 million, together with a deferred tax asset of 236 million and a loss on settlement of pre-existing relationships of 31 million.
The contingent consideration is payable based on a percentage of the future sales performance of compounds developed by the joint venture, if they become marketed products, and so the total amount payable is unlimited.
The results of the acquired business are reported as part of ViiV Healthcare.
Acquisition costs expensed in 2012 arising on this acquisition amounted to 2 million.

The exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
For this purpose, our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk.
Foreign currency cash ows can be hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury and the TMG.
Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency.
In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash ows.
These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.
Forward contracts in major currencies are also used to reduce our exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets see Net investment hedges section of this note for further details.
The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly.
Credit risk The Group considers its maximum credit risk at 31 December 2012 to be 9,469 million 31 December 2011 11,541 million which is the total of the Groups financial assets with the exception of Other investments comprising equity investments which bear equity risk rather than credit risk.
See page 197 for details on the Groups total financial assets.
At 31 December 2012, GSKs greatest concentration of credit risk was 1.2 billion of bank deposits with HSBC Aa3 AA-.
In 2011, the greatest concentration of credit risk was 2.0 billion of investments bearing credit exposure to the US Government rated Aaa AA with Moodys and Standard and Poors respectively.
Treasury-related credit risk GSK sets global counterparty limits for each of GSKs banking and investment counterparties based on long-term credit ratings from Moodys and Standard and Poors.
Corporate Treasurys usage of these limits is monitored daily by a Corporate Compliance officer CCO who operates independently of Corporate Treasury.
Any breach of these limits would be reported to the CFO immediately.
The CCO also monitors the credit rating of these counterparties and, when changes in ratings occur, noties Corporate Treasury so that changes can be made to investment levels or to authority limits as appropriate.
In addition, a report on relationship banks and their credit ratings is presented annually to the TMG for approval and reviewed regularly.
GSK has managed its exposure to credit risk more actively in recent years, reducing surplus cash balances in particular in the USA, Europe, Middle East and Africa.
This is part of our Treasury strategy to regionalise our cash management and to concentrate cash centrally as much as possible.
GSK has continued to maintain its conservative approach to counterparty risk throughout this period.
The table below sets out the credit exposure to counterparties by rating for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives.
The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, although, under ISDA agreements, the amount at risk is the net position with each counterparty.
The 158 million invested in Baa3 BBBrated investments includes bank deposits with HDFC Bank, State Bank of India, BBVA Venezuela and China Merchants Bank.
These counterparties are used either for local cash management purposes or for local investment purposes where GSK is not the sole shareholder.
The 5 million invested in Ba2 BB rated counterparties at 31 December 2012 and 17m at 31 December 2011 comprise bank balances held by operating companies overseas.

Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used Level 1.
Where such prices are not available, the asset or liability is classied as Level 2, provided all significant inputs to the valuation model used are based on observable market data.
If one or more of the significant inputs to the valuation model is not based on observable market data, the instrument is classied as Level 3.
Other investments classied as Level 3 in the tables below comprise equity investments in unlisted entities with which the Group has entered into research collaborations and also investments in emerging life science companies.

This consideration is expected to be paid over several years and will vary in line with sales of dolutegravir, for which regulatory applications for marketing approval were submitted in the European Union, the USA and Canada in December 2012.
A probability of success has been applied in valuing the contingent consideration and success in obtaining regulatory approval would result in an increase in the liability and a charge to the Income Statement of approximately 74 million.
If regulatory approval is not obtained, no contingent consideration will be payable and the liability will be released through the income statement.

At 31 December 2012, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts consisting primarily of currency swaps with a net liability fair value of 35 million 2011 128 million net liability which represent hedges of inter-company loans and deposits, external debt and legal provisions, that are not designated as accounting hedges.
Fair value movements are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing, external debt and legal provisions.
Fair value hedges The Group has designated a series of interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge.
The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bond arising from interest rate uctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance expense.
The carrying value of bonds in a designated hedging relationship on page 197 includes 970 million 2011 1,046 million that is deemed a hedged item in a fair value hedge relationship.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its European Euro and Japanese Yen foreign operations as shown in the table above.
The carrying value of bonds in a designated hedging relationship on page 197 includes 2,309 million 2011 4,861 million that is deemed a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge relationship.
Cash ow hedges During December 2012, the Group entered into a non-deliverable foreign exchange contract which it designated as a cash ow hedge of a foreign exchange exposure arising on the recognition of a liability denominated in Indian Rupee in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had no designated cash ow hedges.

f Sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations as at 31 December.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, trade receivables and payables and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies and has concluded that a 10 cent or 10 yen movement in rates against Sterling is reasonable.
In this analysis, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Obligations under finance leases, inter-company loans that are fully hedged to maturity and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt are excluded as they do not present a material exposure.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets and liabilities other than financial instruments is not included in the calculation.
The movement in the income statement in the table below relates primarily to hedging instruments for legal provisions and to trade receivables and payables.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related remeasurement of provisions is not included in the calculation.
2012 2011 Increase in Increase in income income Income statement impact of non-functional currency foreign exchange exposures m m 10 cent appreciation of the US dollar 2011: 10 cent 41 137 10 cent appreciation of the Euro 2011: 10 cent 29 16 10 yen appreciation of the Yen 2011: 20 yen 1 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would cause the following increase decrease in income 36 million, 25 million and nil for US dollar, Euro and Yen exchange rates respectively 2011 129 million, 14 million and 1 million.
202 GSK Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued The movements in equity in the table below relate to hedging instruments foreign exchange derivatives and external debt designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the Group assets denominated in Euro and Yen.

The table below presents the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates based on the composition of net debt as shown in Note 32 adjusting for the effects of foreign exchange derivatives that are not part of net debt but affect future foreign currency cash ows.
2012 2011 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in net debt net debt Net debt impact of non-functional foreign currency exchange exposures m m 10 cent appreciation of the US dollar 2011: 10 cent 460 392 10 cent appreciation of the Euro 2011: 10 cent 248 21 10 yen appreciation of the Yen 2011: 20 yen 15 70 An equivalent depreciation in the above currencies would cause the following increase decrease in net debt: 407 million, 211 million and 13 million for US dollar, Euro and Yen exchange rates respectively 2011 344 million, 29 million and 50 million.
Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows on an indicative basis the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its oating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being the currencies in which GSK has historically issued debt and held investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 1% 100 basis points increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is oating rate for this calculation.
Interest rate movements on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are deemed to have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement due to compensating amounts in the carrying value of debt.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2012 2011 Increase Increase decrease in decrease in income income Income statement impact of interest rate movements m m 1% 100 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 2011: 1% 5 7 1% 100 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 2011: 1% 12 1% 100 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 2011: 1% 12 15 These interest rates could not be decreased by 1% 100 basis points as they are currently less than 1.0%.
The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 2 million, nil and nil for Sterling, US dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2011 5 million, 1 million and 14 million.
g Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following tables provides an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.

The gross cash ows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table, though, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have increased compared to 31 December 2011 due to higher levels of hedging of inter-company loans and external debt.
This is reected in the increased principal amounts shown in the table below.

In addition, GSK operates the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets and the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Grants under share option schemes and awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc but in some circumstances will be settled in cash.
Options under the share option schemes were granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options and awards to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2010, 2011 and 2012 are as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Risk-free interest rate 0.1% 0.5% 0.5% 1.9% 0.8% 1.9% Dividend yield 5.2% 5.8% 5.3% Volatility 18% 23% 24% 28% 26% 29% Expected lives of options granted under: Share option schemes 4 years 5 years 5 years Savings-related share option and share award schemes 3-4 years 3-4 years 3-4 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Shares 14.35 11.90 12.04 ADS $45.57 $39.10 $37.29 0% for those plans where dividends are reinvested.
204 GSK Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements 42 Employee share schemes continued Volatility is determined based on the three and five year share price history where appropriate.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2011 onwards to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on four equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.
The first measure is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash ow targets.
The second measure is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group.
The remaining two measures are based on business-specic performance measures on business diversication and R&D new product performance.
For details on the calculation of these measures, see the Remuneration Report on pages 109 to 136.
For awards granted in 2009 and 2010 to Directors and members of the CET, 40% of the award is based on the achievement of adjusted free cash ow targets over a three year measurement period.
The remaining 60% of the award is based on relative TSR performance against a comparator group as described on pages 115 and 117.
Half of the TSR element of each award is measured over three years and half over four years.
Awards granted to Directors and members of the CET prior to 2009 are subject to a single performance condition which compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For those awards made to all other eligible employees prior to 2009 the performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50% of the award.
The first part of the performance condition compares GSKs EPS growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year measurement period.
The second part of the performance condition compares GSKs TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.
For awards granted from 2009 onwards, the first part of the performance condition continues to be based on EPS.
The second part of the performance condition is based on strategic or operational business measures, over a three year measurement period, specic to the employees business area.
