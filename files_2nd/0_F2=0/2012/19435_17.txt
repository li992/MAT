Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 1.
General information Raven Russia Limited the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group is a property investment group specialising in commercial real estate in Russia.
The Company is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey under the provisions of the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
The Companys registered office is 1 Le Truchot, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 6EH.
The audited financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries and were authorised by the Board for issue on 10 March 2013.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Company has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008, section 244, not to prepare company financial statements as group financial statements have been prepared for both current and prior periods.
The group financial statements are presented in US Dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand dollars US$000 except where otherwise indicated.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the group financial statements are set out below.
The policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies.
The areas involving a high degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.
Statement of compliance The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union IFRS and the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except that the Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2012: New and amended standards: IAS 12 Income Taxes Recovery of Underlying Assets IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Enhanced Derecognition Disclosure Requirements The principal effects of these changes on the financial statements of the Group, if any, are as follows: IAS 12 Income Taxes Recovery of Underlying Assets The amendment clarified the calculation of deferred tax on investment property measured at fair value and introduced a rebuttable presumption that such deferred tax should be determined on the basis that the carrying amount will be recovered through sale of the property.
This clarification will not have any impact on the results of the Group as the tax rates associated with investment property in Russia do not differ if the property is recovered through sale or use.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Enhanced Derecognition Disclosure Requirements The amendment requires additional disclosures about financial assets that have been transferred but not derecognised.
The Group does not have any assets with these characteristics, so there has not been any effect in the presentation of its financial statements.
36 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Certain new standards, interpretations and amendments or revisions to existing standards, which may be relevant to the Group, have been published that are mandatory for later accounting periods and which have not been adopted early.
These are: IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income effective 1 July 2012 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement effective 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities effective 1 January 2014 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective 1 January 2013 With the exception of the following matters, the Group has determined that the impact of these changes on its financial statements will not be material.
The adoption of IFRS 11 will require the Groups joint ventures to be equity accounted.
Presently these arrangements are proportionately consolidated.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 10 on its financial statements and the effect of this, if any, has yet to be determined.
The standards, amendments or revisions are effective for annual periods beginning on or after the dates noted above.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries and the special purpose vehicles SPVs controlled by the Company, made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The Group has acquired investment properties through the purchase of SPVs.
In the opinion of the Directors, these transactions did not meet the definition of a business combination as set out in IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Accordingly the transactions have not been accounted for as an acquisition of a business and instead the financial statements reflect the substance of the transactions, which is considered to be the purchase of investment property and investment property under construction.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of entities acquired to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated on consolidation.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Cost comprises the fair values of assets given, liabilities assumed and equity instruments issued.
For business combinations after 1 January 2010, transaction costs associated with an acquisition are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill is capitalised with any impairment in carrying value being charged to the Income Statement.
Impairment tests on goodwill are undertaken annually at the financial year end.
Impairment charges are included in the administrative expenses line item in the Income Statement.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.
Where the interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired exceeds the cost of the combination, the resulting negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake economic activity that is subject to joint control.
The Group undertakes its joint ventures through jointly controlled entities.
The Group financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of these entities assets, liabilities, income and expenditure on a line by line basis from the date on which joint control commences to the date on which joint control ceases.
Any premium paid for an interest in a jointly controlled entity above the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is accounted for in accordance with the goodwill accounting policy.
37 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Revenue recognition a Property investment Rental income from operating leases is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Rental increases calculated with reference to an underlying index and the resulting rental income contingent rents are recognised in income as they are determined.
Incentives for lessees to enter into lease agreements are spread evenly over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with any further term for which the tenant has the option to continue the lease, where, at the inception of the lease, the directors are reasonably certain that the tenant will exercise that option.
Premiums received to terminate leases are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
b Roslogistics Logistics revenue, excluding value added tax, is recognised as services are provided.
c Raven Mount The sales of completed properties and land are recognised on legal completion.
Taxation The Company is a limited company registered in Guernsey, Channel Islands, and is exempt from taxation.
The Group is liable to Russian, UK and Cypriot tax arising on the results of its Russian, UK and Cypriot operations.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
a Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit or loss as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income and expenditure that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
b Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.
38 Notes to the Financial Statements continued c Value added tax Revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities are recognised net of the amount of value added tax except: Where the value added tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the value added tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expenditure item as applicable: and Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of value added tax included.
The net amount of value added tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables, as appropriate, in the balance sheet.
Investment property and investment property under construction Investment property comprises completed property and property under construction held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment property comprises both freehold and leasehold land and buildings.
Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including related transaction costs.
After initial recognition, investment property is carried at fair value.
The Directors assess the fair value of investment property based on independent valuations carried out by their appointed property valuers or on independent valuations prepared for banking purposes.
The Group has appointed Jones Lang LaSalle as property valuers to prepare valuations on a semi-annual basis.
Valuations are undertaken in accordance with appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements contained in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 7th Edition the Red Book.
This is an internationally accepted basis of valuation.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
For the purposes of these financial statements, in order to avoid double counting, the assessed fair value is reduced by the present value of any tenant incentives and contracted rent uplifts that are spread over the lease term and increased by the carrying amount of any liability under a head lease that has been recognised in the balance sheet.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction of investment property are included in the cost of the property from the date of commencement of construction until construction is completed.
Leasing as lessors Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
All of the Groups properties are leased under operating leases and are included in investment property in the balance sheet.
Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventory includes land, work in progress and completed units that are available for sale.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets into one of the categories discussed below, depending upon the purpose for which the asset was acquired.
The Group has not classified any of its financial assets as held to maturity.
a Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises only in-the-money derivatives see financial liabilities policy for out-of-the-money derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the income statement in finance income or finance expense.
b Loans and receivables These are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
In the case of the Group, loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, loans and cash and short term deposits.
39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to their acquisition or issue, and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in administrative expenses.
If in a subsequent period the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment is recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any such reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Cash and short term deposits include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity comprises ordinary shares and listed warrants.
The Group classifies its financial liabilities into one of the categories listed below.
a Fair value through profit or loss This category comprises only out-of-the-money derivatives, which are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recognised in the income statement in finance income or finance expense.
b Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities include interest bearing loans, trade payables including rent deposits and retentions under construction contracts, preference shares and other short-term monetary liabilities.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest bearing loans and preference shares are initially recorded at fair value net of direct issue costs and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
When the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to a provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
Own shares held Own equity instruments which are acquired are recognised at cost and deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration is recognised in retained earnings.
Share-based payments and other long term incentives The Group rewards its key management and other senior employees by a variety of means many of which are settled by ordinary or preference shares of the Company, these include the Executive Share Option Schemes, the Bonus Plan and the Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012 to 2014.
40 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Awards linked to or settled by ordinary shares These are accounted for as equity-settled transactions in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer, using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance conditions vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions, which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the fair value at grant date.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense which is recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date, reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and service conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
Awards linked to or settled by preference shares These awards are accounted for under IAS 19 Employee Benefits whereby the Group estimates the cost of awards using the projected unit credit method, which involves estimating the future value of the preference shares at the vesting date and the probability of the awards vesting.
The resulting expense is charged to the income statement over the performance period and the liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date.
Foreign currency translation a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each Group entity are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
For the Company, the directors consider this to be Sterling.
The presentation currency of the Group is United States Dollars, which the directors consider to be the key currency for the Groups operations as a whole.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at the year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction or when their fair values are reassessed.
c On consolidation The results and financial position of all the Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: i assets and liabilities for each balance sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet: ii income and expenditure for each income statement are translated at the average exchange rate prevailing in the period: and iii all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
41 Notes to the Financial Statements continued On consolidation, the exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When a foreign entity is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Dividends Dividends to the Companys ordinary shareholders are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends, this is when declared by the directors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when they are approved by the shareholders at an AGM.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes certain estimates and judgements regarding the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience as adjusted for current market conditions and other factors.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and judgements that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are outlined below.
Judgements other than estimates In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies the following are considered to have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: a Acquisitions Properties can be acquired through the corporate acquisition of a subsidiary company.
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether the acquisition represents the acquisition of a business.
The Group accounts for the acquisition as a business combination where an integrated set of activities is acquired in addition to the property.
More specifically, consideration is made of the extent to which significant processes are acquired and the extent of ancillary services provided by the subsidiary.
When the acquisition of a subsidiary does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets and liabilities.
The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their relative fair values, and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
b Recognition of deferred tax assets The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
c Acquisitions of investment property The consideration payable in respect of each acquisition is dependent upon certain future events.
In calculating the cost of each acquisition the Group has assessed the most probable outcome as at the balance sheet date.
These amounts are reconsidered annually at each year end.
The assessments include consideration of the future rental levels and costs of construction of a property as well as the terms of the legal agreements governing each acquisition.
Based on these factors management will consider whether a liability or a contingent liability should be recognised or disclosed at the balance sheet date.
Estimates a Valuation of investment property and investment property under construction The best evidence of fair value is current prices in an active market for similar lease and other contracts.
In the absence of such information, the Group determines the amount within a range of reasonable, fair value estimates.
In making its judgement the Group considers information from a variety of sources and engages external, professional advisers to carry out third party 42 Notes to the Financial Statements continued valuations of its properties.
These are completed in accordance with appropriate sections of the current Practice Statements contained in the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Appraisal and Valuation Standards, 7th Edition the Red Book.
In completing these valuations the valuers use their market knowledge and professional judgement and consider the following: i current prices in an active market for properties of a different nature, condition or location or subject to different lease or other contracts, adjusted to reflect those differences: ii recent prices of similar properties in less active markets, with adjustments to reflect any changes in economic conditions since the date of the transactions occurred at those prices: and iii discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows, derived from the terms of any existing lease or other contracts and where possible from external evidence such as current market rents for similar properties in the same location and condition, and using discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the uncertainty in the amount and timing of cash flows.
All of the above require the valuers to make estimates and assumptions.
In our market, where transactional activity is minimal, the valuers are required to use a greater degree of estimation or judgement than in a market where comparable transactions are more readily available.
b Income tax As part of the process of preparing its financial statements, the Group is required to estimate the provision for income tax in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This process involves an estimation of the actual current tax exposure, together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes.
These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the balance sheet.
Russian tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations and changes, which may occur frequently.
The interpretation of legislation that the Group applies to its transactions and activities may be challenged by the relevant regional and federal authorities.
Additionally there may be inconsistent interpretation of tax regulations by various authorities, creating uncertainties in the taxation environment in Russia.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities for the three calendar years preceding the years of review and in some circumstances may cover a longer period.
Additionally, there have been instances where tax regulations have taken effect retrospectively.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
c Provisions The provision relating to the ongoing litigation in CJSC Toros see note 24 requires the estimation of the likely outcome of the legal proceedings.
In making the estimate, management has taken account of advice received from its legal advisors.
Segmental information The Group has three operating segments, which are managed and report independently to the Board of the Group.
These comprise: Property investment acquire, develop and lease commercial property in Russia Roslogistics provision of warehousing, transport, customs brokerage and related services in Russia Raven Mount sale of residential property in the UK Financial information relating to Property Investment is provided to the Board on a property by property basis.
The information provided is gross rentals, operating costs, net operating income, revaluation gains and losses and where relevant the profit or loss on disposal of an investment property.
The individual properties have similar economic characteristics and are aggregated into a single reporting segment.
43 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Information about Raven Mount provided to the Board comprises the gross sale proceeds, inventory cost of sales and gross profit, including the share of profits or losses of its joint venture.
Roslogistics is an independently managed business and the Board is presented with turnover, cost of sales and operating profits or losses after deduction of administrative expenses.
Administrative expenses and foreign currency gains or losses are reported to the Board by segment.
Finance income and finance expense are not reported to the Board on a segment basis.
Sales between segments are eliminated prior to provision of financial information to the Board.
For the balance sheet, segmental information is provided in relation to investment property, inventory, cash balances and borrowings.
Whilst segment liabilities includes loans and borrowings, segment loss does not include the related finance costs.
If such finance costs were included in segment profit or loss, the profit from Property Investment would have decreased by US$58,446k 2011: US$41,279k and the loss from Raven Mount increased by US$20k 2011: US$408k.
Aggregate segment profit would have decreased by US$58,466k 2011: US$41,687k.

Earnings measures In addition to reporting IFRS earnings the Group adopts the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA earnings measure, as set out in their Best Practice Policy Recommendations document issued in August 2011 and also reports its own underlying earnings measure.
EPRA earnings The EPRA earnings measure excludes investment property revaluations and gains or losses on disposal of investment property, intangible asset movements, gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and related taxation.
Underlying earnings Underlying earnings consists of the EPRA earnings measure, with additional group adjustments.
The Directors consider underlying earnings to be a key performance measure, as this is the measure used by Management to assess the return on holding investment assets for the long term.
Adjustments include share-based payments and other long term incentives, the accretion of premiums payable on redemption of preference shares, material non-recurring items, depreciation and amortisation of loan origination costs.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: 2012 2011 Earnings US$000 US$000 Earnings for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share being the net profit for the year prepared under IFRS 29,414 88,363 Adjustments to arrive at EPRA earnings: Loss on disposal of investment property under construction 1,158 Unrealised profit on revaluation of investment property 68,055 133,062 Unrealised loss profit on revaluation of investment property under construction 3,696 10,611 Profit loss on maturing foreign currency derivative financial instruments note 7 140 401 Change in fair value of open forward currency derivative financial instruments note 7 1,186 2,200 Loss on closure of interest rate derivative financial instruments note 7 5 Change in fair value of open interest rate derivative financial instruments note 7 5,102 2,784 Movement on deferred tax thereon 18,981 33,444 Adjusted EPRA earnings 12,188 15,318 Inventory write down note 17 9,371 2,454 Loss on disposal of plant and equipment note 6a 337 Share-based payments and other long term incentives 16,609 6,099 Premium on redemption of preference shares and amortisation of issue costs note 7 1,109 1,094 Listing costs note 6a 548 Depreciation note 6a 1,706 1,754 Amortisation of loan origination costs note 7 3,661 3,979 Tax charge on unrealised foreign exchange movements in loans 9,999 Underlying earnings 30,267 947 49 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2012 2011 Number of shares No 000 No 000 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic EPS excluding own shares held 570,834 528,185 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Listed warrants note 28 19,532 48,269 ERS note 32 1,755 3,102 LTIP note 32 5,384 5,361 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted EPS excluding own shares held 597,505 584,917 2012 2011 Cents Cents EPS basic 5.15 16.73 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Listed warrants 0.18 1.40 ERS 0.01 0.08 LTIP 0.04 0.14 Diluted EPS cents 4.92 15.11 EPRA EPS basic cents 2.14 2.90 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Listed warrants ERS LTIP EPRA EPS diluted cents 2.14 2.90 Underlying EPS basic cents 5.30 0.18 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Listed warrants 0.18 0.02 ERS 0.01 LTIP 0.05 Underlying EPS diluted cents 5.06 0.16 10.

The fair value of the Groups investment property at 31 December 2012 has been arrived at on the basis of market valuations carried out by Jones Lang LaSalle JLL, external valuers to the Group.
JLL have consented to the use of their name in these financial statements.
The valuations used by the Directors in these financial statements have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors Valuation Standards, 7th Edition the Red Book.
The definition of market value is the estimated amount for which an asset should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations, which were specific to the Group: No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation or for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property: The market values reported are gross of purchasers costs, which would be incurred on the sale of assets as this is the recognised valuation approach in Russia: and No account is taken of the future effect of any index based rent uplifts.
At 31 December 2012 the Group has pledged investment property with a value of US$1,445 million 2011: US$1,049 million to secure banking facilities granted to the Group note 22.

Assets under construction and additional phases of completed investment property are valued by JLL.
Assets under construction are valued using the residual value method and additional phases of completed investment property on a comparable sales basis, based on recent real estate transactions with similar characteristics and location to those assets.
There were no assets under construction at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2012.
The Directors have valued the land bank based on JLL valuations or the amounts they consider they can achieve on a sale of permitted land and land with access and infrastructure.
The Directors also considered updated acquisition appraisals, the key assumptions being developers required returns, market rents and yields on completed properties.
On this basis the Directors consider the fair value of the land bank not valued by JLL to be US$35.6 million, which equates to an average price of US$14.5 per square metre 2011: US$16.3.
At 31 December 2012 the Group has pledged investment property under construction with a value of US$14.2 million 2011: US$11.3 million to secure banking facilities granted to the Group note 22.

Share-based payments and other long term incentives The Group utilises a number of different Share Schemes to reward and incentivise the Groups executives and senior staff.
The Share Schemes operated in the year are as follows: Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS The Group operates two ESOS, the Employee Retention Scheme ERS and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Both schemes involved the grant of options over the Companys ordinary shares by the Companys Employee Benefit Trusts.
The ERS vested in full on the publication of the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the ERS options do not have an exercise price.
The LTIP options vest in three equal tranches, subject to performance criteria, on 24 March 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The LTIP options have an exercise price of 25p per option and the first tranche vested in full on 24 March 2012.
The performance criteria for each tranche are based on meeting a target of total shareholder return of 7.5% over UK RPI.
Both the ERS and LTIP schemes are closed and further awards cannot be made under either scheme.
Awards made under the ERS and LTIP have been accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Combined Bonus and Long Term Incentive Scheme 2012 to 2014 CBLTIS During the year the Group implemented the CBLTIS and contingent awards were made in respect of 14.3 million ordinary shares and 3.7 million preference shares and which cover the calendar years 2012 to 2014.
The awards are subject to performance criteria explained in the Remuneration Report.
Awards in respect of ordinary shares are accounted for in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for Share-based payments.
Awards to be settled by preference shares do not meet the criteria under IFRS for a Share-based payment and are instead accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Company also made an award of 4.2 million 2011: 4.6 million ordinary shares to satisfy bonuses to the Executive Directors and senior management.

Raven Russia Employee Benefit Trust No.
1 the EBT As set out in note 23, on 26 June 2012 the Company issued and admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange 48,414,250 new preference shares under the terms of a placing and open offer.
The trustees of the EBT acquired 5 million of new preference shares as part of the placing.
The acquisition of these preference shares by the EBT on a non-preemptive basis constitutes a smaller related party transaction under the UKLAs Listing Rules.
Transactions, arrangements and agreements involving key management personnel There are no loan balances with directors.
In 2011 the Group advanced a loan of 1.2 million to one of the Groups key management personnel.
The loan, which bore interest at a commercial rate and was secured by a first legal charge over a UK property, was repaid during the year.

Financial instruments risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks in relation to the financial instruments it uses: market risk including currency risk, price risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The financial risks relate to the following financial instruments: trade receivables, cash and short term deposits, trade and other payables, borrowings, preference shares and derivative financial instruments.
Risk management parameters are established by the Board on a project by project basis and overseen by management in conjunction with professional advisers.
Reports are provided to the Board formally on a weekly basis and also when authorised changes are required.
a Market risk Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from a variety of currency exposures, primarily with respect to US Dollars, Sterling and Russian Rouble.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions including construction contracts and lease receivables, recognised monetary assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign entities.
The majority of the Groups transactions are denominated in US Dollars, which is also the reporting currency for the Group.
The functional currency of the Company is Sterling, however the functional currencies of the Companys subsidiaries varies.
The analysis that follows considers the impact of Russian Rouble and Sterling on the Group.
64 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Russian Rouble Whilst the Group has some Rouble denominated overhead and maintains modest levels of Rouble cash balances to fund the working capital requirements of the investment property portfolio in Russia, it is during a period of substantial construction activity that the Group can become exposed to significant Rouble currency risk.
This is because construction contracts have tended to be denominated in Roubles.
The Group is not currently in a period of substantial construction but when this has been the case the Group has taken out non deliverable forwards to hedge against the US Dollar Rouble cash flow exposure.
The other principal area where the Rouble can affect the Group is the accounting adjustments that are required when consolidating the results of some of the property owning subsidiaries that have a Rouble functional currency.
Exchange gains or losses arising as a result of these consolidation accounting adjustments are included in the translation reserve.
Sterling The Groups exposure to Sterling is primarily driven by the Sterling denominated preference shares and the related quarterly preference dividends, but also head office costs and ordinary dividends.
Whilst there are no Sterling foreign exchange gains and losses arising in the parent company itself, in preparing the group financial statements these Sterling amounts are translated to the Groups US Dollar presentation currency and the resulting exchange gains and losses are included in the translation reserve.
The table below summarises the currency in which the Groups financial instruments are denominated: Russian US Dollar Sterling Rouble Other Total As at 31 December 2012 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Non-current assets Loans receivable 1,587 4 1,591 Derivative financial instruments 627 3,651 4,278 Current assets Trade receivables 24,036 2,249 4,418 30,703 Loans receivable 64 64 Derivative financial instruments 960 960 Other current receivables 41,315 343 620 8 42,286 Cash and short term deposits 78,774 51,578 60,776 569 191,697 144,752 60,368 65,882 577 271,579 Non-current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 645,121 645,121 Preference shares 325,875 325,875 Derivative financial instruments 9,103 9,103 Rent deposits 22,672 312 22,984 Investment property acquisition obligations 2,929 2,929 Retentions under construction contracts Other payables 1,845 241 2,086 Current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 121,936 121,936 Derivative financial instruments 206 400 606 Other payables 22 6,131 30,314 36,467 801,989 333,851 30,955 312 1,167,107 65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Russian US Dollar Sterling Rouble Other Total As at 31 December 2011 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Non-current assets Loans receivable 4 4 Derivative financial instruments 1,216 1,216 Current assets Trade receivables 16,836 1,284 3,728 21,848 Loans receivable 2,411 72 2,483 Derivative financial instruments Other current receivables 989 2,101 183 4 3,277 Cash and short term deposits 119,053 30,519 31,732 522 181,826 138,094 36,315 35,719 526 210,654 Non-current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 465,638 465,638 Preference shares 218,206 218,206 Derivative financial instruments 8,968 8,968 Rent deposits 12,162 2,228 443 14,833 Investment property acquisition obligations 2,929 2,929 Retentions under construction contracts Other payables 590 590 Current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 82,637 12,970 95,607 Derivative financial instruments Other payables 5,939 27,575 22 33,536 572,334 237,115 30,393 465 840,307 The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated, for example a change in interest rate and a change in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group principally manages foreign currency risk on a project by project basis.
The sensitivity analysis prepared by management of foreign currency risk illustrates how changes in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The table below shows the impact on consolidation if the US Dollar weakened or strengthened by 10% against the Russian Rouble or Sterling, with all other variables in each case remaining constant, then: 2012 2011 Post tax profit or loss would change by: US$000 US$000 Russian Rouble 869 296 Sterling 3,230 3,513 2012 2011 Net asset value would change by: US$000 US$000 Russian Rouble 641 196 Sterling 24,184 20,481 The majority of Sterling sensitivity relates to the retranslation of the value of irredeemable preference shares.
66 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Accounting standards also require disclosure of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currency of the specific subsidiary or entity in the Group.
These are set out in the tables below.
Russian US Dollar Sterling Rouble Other As at 31 December 2012 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Current assets Trade receivables 2,608 Cash and short term deposits 62,407 21 65,015 21 Non-current liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 30,000 30,000 As at 31 December 2011 Current assets Trade receivables 2,623 Cash and short term deposits 70,585 115 73,208 115 The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings note 22, which include preference shares issued note 23.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whilst borrowings issued at a fixed rate expose the Group to fair value risk.
The Groups cash flow and fair value risk is reviewed monthly by the Board.
The cash flow and fair value risk is approved monthly by the Board.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a dynamic basis.
It takes on exposure to the effects of fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates on its financial position and cash flows.
Interest costs may increase as a result of such changes.
They may reduce or create losses in the event that unexpected movements arise.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios the Group calculates the impact on profit and loss of a defined interest rate shift.
The simulation is run on an on-going basis to verify that the maximum potential impact is within the parameters expected by management.
Formal reporting to the Board on cash flows is made on a monthly basis.
To date the Group has sought to fix its exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings through the use of a variety of interest rate derivatives and the issue of preference shares at a fixed coupon.
This gives certainty over future cash flow but exposure to fair value movements, which amounted to an accumulated unrealised loss of US$8.7 million at 31 December 2012 2011: loss of US$5.5 million.
Sensitivity analysis on the Groups interest rate borrowings, net of interest bearing deposits, indicate that a 1% increase in LIBOR rates would decrease the profit for the year and net assets by US$600,000 2011: US$400,000.
If LIBOR rates were to drop to zero then there would be a decrease in the profit for the year and in net assets of US$1.9 million 2011: US$0.9 million as the loss on income from cash would be greater than gains on interest expense because of the low LIBOR rates prevailing at this time and the interest rate hedges in place.
67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued b Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and short term deposits, trade and other receivables and derivative financial instruments.
Credit risk associated with the Groups trade and other receivables is considered low due to the Group having policies in place to ensure that rental contracts are made with tenants meeting appropriate balance sheet covenants, supplemented by rental deposits or bank guarantees from international banks.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables concerned.
Details of the movements in provision for impairment of trade receivables is provided in the table below.
2012 2011 US$000 US$000 At 1 January 377 377 Charge for the year 1,593 Utilised in the year Unused amounts reversed At 31 December 1,970 377 At 31 December 2012 there were no significant amounts of trade receivables that were past due for collection 2011: US$ nil.
The Group has VAT recoverable of US$14 million 2011: US$15.4 million.
The timing of recovery of these balances is subject to future revenue receipts and application to the Russian Courts.
The Group forecasts the recovery of these balances based upon the timing of future revenue receipts and its experience of successful application to the Russian Courts.
No balances are considered past due or impaired at 31 December 2012 2011: US$ nil based upon this assessment of the timing of future cash receipts.
The Group believes its only exposure is in relation to the timing of recovery.
The credit risk of the Groups cash and short term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures.
c Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
The Board and its advisers seek to have appropriate credit facilities in place on a project by project basis, either from available cash resources or from bank facilities.
Management monitor the Groups liquidity position on a daily basis.
Formal liquidity reports are issued from all jurisdictions on a weekly basis and are reviewed monthly by the Board, along with cash flow forecasts.
A summary table with maturity of financial liabilities is presented below.
All amounts shown are gross undiscounted cash flows.
The Group is subject to interest costs in perpetuity in respect of preference shares, which have no contractual maturity date.
The table above does not show cash flows beyond 10 years.
The Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds by forecasting cash flow requirements for future years.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and other short term borrowing facilities, bank loans and equity fund raisings.
Fair values Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments in the financial statements.

The fair value of short term deposits, other assets, trade and other receivables, trade and other 69 payables is assumed to approximate to their book values.
The fair value of preference shares is assumed to be their last quoted price.
The fair value of derivatives is determined by a model with market based inputs.
Notes to the Financial Statements continued Fair value hierarchy The following table shows an analysis of the fair values of financial instruments recognised in the balance sheet by level of the fair value hierarchy : Total Fair Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Value US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 As at 31 December 2012 Assets measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments 5,238 5,238 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments 9,709 9,709 As at 31 December 2011 Assets measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments 1,216 1,216 Liabilities measured at fair value Derivative financial instruments 8,968 8,968 Explanation of the fair value hierarchy: Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the balance sheet date.
Level 2 Use of a model with inputs that are directly or indirectly observable market data.
Level 3 Use of a model with inputs that are not based on observable market data.
d Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
For capital risk management, the Directors consider both the ordinary and preference shares to be permanent capital of the Company, with similar rights as to cancellation.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, under take tender offers, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in its industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of its gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total liabilities but excluding provisions, head lease obligations and preference shares, which for capital risk management is considered to be capital rather than debt, less cash and short term deposits.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the balance sheet, plus preference shares and net debt.
Where the Group has a net cash position, the gearing ratio will be zero.
Subsequent events Details of post year end warrant exercises are set out in note 28.
Operating lease arrangements The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under non-cancellable operating leases.

Acquisitions in the year The Group made three acquisitions in the year, Pushkino Logistics Park, Sholokhovo and land at Padikovo.
In each case the Group purchased each of the properties by acquiring all of the issued share capital of the corporate vehicles that owned the properties.
In accordance with its accounting policy the Group considered each acquisition in turn, assessing whether an integrated set of activities had been acquired in addition to the property.
In each case it was concluded a business had not been purchased but rather the acquisition of a group of assets and related liabilities.
