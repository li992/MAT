Goodwill is allocated as follows: Group Parent company 2012 2011 2012 2011 restated million million million million Environmental Technologies Emission Control Technologies Non-light Duty Catalysts 84.4 89.2 Process Technologies 245.3 249.4 110.5 110.5 Precious Metal Products Catalysts and Chemicals 24.8 24.9 Other 5.6 5.8 Fine Chemicals Macfarlan Smith 117.1 117.1 Pharmaceutical Materials and Services 20.7 20.7 Research Chemicals 21.6 21.6 519.5 528.7 110.5 110.5 The group and parent company test goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets and plans approved by management, generally covering a three year period except as discussed below.
The budgets and plans are based on a number of key assumptions.
Assumptions on the likelihood and timing of new product launches are based on managements best estimate of what may happen.
Foreign exchange rates are based on actual rates at the time the budgets were prepared and are held constant over the budget and plan years.
Other assumptions such as market share, expected changes to selling prices, product profitability, precious metal prices and other direct input costs are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the markets using external sources of information where appropriate.
These cash flows are then extrapolated using the long term average growth rates for the relevant products, industries and countries in which the CGUs operate.
The cash flows are discounted at the groups estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the estimated tax cash flows and risk applicable to each CGU.
For the Non-light Duty Catalysts CGU five 2011 four year plans have been approved by management.
Over the next decade management expects the markets for heavy duty diesel catalysts and stationary emissions catalysts will continue to grow significantly, based on emission control legislation already in place or anticipated, as described on pages 30 and 31 of the Financial Review of Operations, although some of this growth is now included in the five year plan.
Therefore the cash flow projections have been extrapolated using a long term average growth rate of 12% for years 6 to 10 2011 20% for years 5 to 10 and 4% 2011 3% after that.
The impairment test results in headroom of 40% over the carrying value of the CGUs net assets and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
