It is a share ownership scheme under which the Participants and Appleby Trust Jersey Limited, the EBT Trustee, held at the balance sheet date separate beneficial interests in 36,305,099 2011: 36,305,099 ordinary shares which represents 5.9% 2011: 6.5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Of these ordinary shares, 1,453,254 are held by the EBT on an unallocated basis.
Nature of interests Interests take the form of a restricted interest in ordinary shares in the Company the Interest.
An Interest permits a Participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company Shares over specified threshold amounts.
In order to acquire an Interest, a Participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the EBT Trustee, under which the Participant and the EBT Trustee jointly acquire the Shares and agree that when the Shares are sold the Participant has a right to receive a proportion of the sale proceeds insofar as the value of the Shares exceeds the threshold amount.
Participants In prior periods Interests were acquired by the first group of Participants under the JSOS scheme JSOS1 in 32,476,700 Shares at an issue price of 1.50 per share, and the second group of Participants JSOS scheme JSOS2 in 3,990,799 Shares at an issue price of 1.70 per share.
For JSOS1 and JSOS2 there are four tranches, each with their own hurdle price.
In the current period, 2,953,675 Shares in which interests of Participants have lapsed were reallocated to the third group of Participants under the JSOS scheme JSOS3.
For JSOS3 there are two tranches, each with their own hurdle price.
For JSOS2, the price was in a range of 7.1% to 10.8%, and for JSOS3, the price was in a range of 1.47% to 1.70% of the share price at date of issue.
When an Interest vests, the EBT Trustee will transfer Shares to the Participant of equal value to the Participants Interest or the Shares will be sold and the EBT Trustee will account to the Participant for the balance, i. e. the difference between the sale proceeds less expenses and the hurdle price.

1 Share options and other equity instruments continued Vesting conditions The vesting of the Interests granted to Participants is subject to a time vesting condition, as detailed above.
The fair value of the Interests awarded under the JSOS was determined using the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model.
As per IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, market based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JSOS have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted: instead, these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately, the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
In determining the fair value of the Interests granted, the BlackScholes Option Pricing Model was used with the following inputs: JSOS1 Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Weighted average share price 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 Weighted average exercise price 1.73 1.91 2.08 2.28 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life years 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% JSOS2 Tranche 1 Tranche 2 Tranche 3 Tranche 4 Weighted average share price 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.70 Weighted average exercise price 1.96 2.15 2.36 2.59 Expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 Weighted expected life years 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 Risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to a basket of others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.
