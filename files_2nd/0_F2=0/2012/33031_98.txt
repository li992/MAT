Impairment In assessing whether a write-down is required in the carrying value of a potentially impaired intangible asset, item of property, plant and equipment or an equity-accounted investment, the assets carrying value is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Unless indicated otherwise, the recoverable amount used in assessing the impairment losses described below is value in use.
The group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the asset and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
This discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specific risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located, although other rates may be used if appropriate to the specific circumstances.
The rate applied in each country is reassessed each year.
In certain circumstances an impairment assessment may be carried out using fair value less costs to sell as the recoverable amount when, for example, a recent market transaction for a similar asset has taken place.
Upstream During 2012, the Upstream segment recognized impairment losses of $3,046 million.
The main elements were a $1,082-million write-down to fair value less costs to sell based on recent market transactions of our interests in the Fayetteville and Woodford shale gas assets in the US, due to reserves revisions: a $999-million impairment loss relating to the decision to suspend the Liberty project in Alaska: a $706-million aggregate write-down of a number of assets, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, caused by increases in the decommissioning provision resulting from continued review of the expected decommissioning costs: a $144-million write-down of certain gas storage assets in Europe due to changes to the European gas market: and other impairment losses amounting to $116 million in total that were not individually significant.
These impairment losses were partly offset by reversals of impairment of certain of our interests in the Gulf of Mexico amounting to $222 million, triggered by a decision to divest assets: and other reversals of impairment amounting to $67 million in total that were not individually significant.
