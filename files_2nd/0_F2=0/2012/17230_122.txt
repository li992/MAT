All of the above companies are registered in England and Wales and the principal area of trading for all the above companies is the United Kingdom.
The Group currently owns 51% of the share capital of Farmers Boy Deeside Limited.
However, due to the nature of options in place to purchase the remaining 49% share capital in 2013, the subsidiary has been treated as if it were already 100% owned for accounting purposes.
Deferred consideration of 13m, in relation to these options, is held within other creditors.
The Company is also part of a joint venture, with The Great Steward of Scotland Dumfries House Trust, to form The Morrisons Farm at Dumfries House Limited, whose principal activity is to farm 859 acres of agricultural land located on the Dumfries House Estate near Cumnock in Ayrshire, Scotland.
This has been accounted for as a joint venture in accordance with IFRS, however, as the results are not material to the Group, no further disclosure has been made of the accounting policies within the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the above, the Company has a number of other subsidiary companies, particulars of which will be annexed to the next annual return.
