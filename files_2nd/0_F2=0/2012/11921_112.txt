Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Defined contribution benefits are based on the amount of contributions paid in respect of an individual member, the investment returns earned and the amount of pension this money will buy when a member retires.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 November 2006, all sections of the UK Group plan were closed to new members with the exception of a defined contribution section that was opened in 2003.
This section is available to all new employees of participating companies.
At 31 December 2012 the UK Group plan has approximately 27,000 members, analysed in the following table: % Active Deferred Pensioners Total Defined benefit 3 26 32 61 Defined contribution 18 21 39 Total 21 47 32 100 The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
Other defined contribution plans are operated principally overseas with the largest plan being in the US.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which employees are located.
Pearson also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.

The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
148 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25.
Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued The inflation rate for the UK Group plan of 3.0% reflects the RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation in 2010, certain benefits have been calculated with reference to CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.5% has been used.
The expected rates of return on categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio, plus a diversification premium.
The expected rate of increase in salaries has been set at 3.5% for 2012 with a short-term assumption of 3.0% for three years.
For the UK plan, the mortality base table assumptions have been derived from the SAPS all pensioners tables for males and the SAPS normal health pensioners tables for females, adjusted to reflect the observed experience of the plan, with medium cohort improvement factors.
A 1.5% improvement floor on the medium cohort is applied for males, and 1.25% for females, with tapering.
For the US plans, the RP2000 table is used, reflecting the mortality assumption most prevalent in the US.
In 2010 a ten-year projection was added.
Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK Group plan and US plans is as follows: UK US 2012 2011 2012 2011 Male 23.0 22.6 19.2 19.2 Female 24.2 23.5 21.1 21.1 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2012 2011 2012 2011 Male 25.1 25.2 19.2 19.2 Female 26.1 25.6 21.1 21.1 Financial statement information The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2012 Defined UK Group benefit Defined All figures in millions plan other Sub-total contribution PRMB Total Current service cost 23 3 26 78 4 108 Total operating expense 23 3 26 78 4 108 Expected return on plan assets 111 8 119 119 Interest on plan liabilities 96 7 103 3 106 Net finance income expense 15 1 16 3 13 Net income statement charge 8 2 10 78 7 95 Actual return on plan assets 146 15 161 161 OVERVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE OUR IMPACT ON SOCIETY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Section 6 Financial statements 149 25.

The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2012 and this valuation revealed a funding shortfall.
The Group has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by June 2017.
In 2012 the Group contributed 48m 2011: 48m towards the funding shortfall.
Following the completion of the triennial funding valuation the Group has agreed to contribute 41m per annum until 2017 in excess of regular contributions.
In addition, a mechanism has been agreed for the Group to make supplementary payments up to a maximum of 15m per annum.
If such payments are made they are expected to accelerate the end date for extinguishing the deficit.
Regular contributions to the plan are estimated to be 23m for 2013.
The Group expects to contribute $80m in 2013 and $84m in 2014 to its US pension plans.
Future benefit payments The following table shows the expected benefit payments from the defined benefit plans over the next ten years.
These use actuarial assumptions as at 31 December 2012.
These represent payments from the pension funds to pensioners and others entitled to benefits, and are not an indication of payments from the company.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations continued Sensitivities The net retirement benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2012 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 311.7 388.1 Decrease of aggregate of service cost and interest cost UK Group plan 0.1 1.2 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 11.6 13.9 The effect of members living one year more or one year less on the defined benefit obligation is as follows: 2012 1 year 1 year All figures in millions increase decrease Effect on: Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 76.7 73.9 Increase decrease in defined benefit obligation US plan 2.1 2.1 The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed medical cost trend rates is as follows: 2012 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Increase decrease in post-retirement medical benefit obligation 2.9 2.6 Increase decrease of aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.1 0.1 154 Pearson plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26.
Share-based payments The Group recognised the following charges in the income statement in respect of its equity-settled share-based payment plans: All figures in millions 2012 2011 Pearson plans 28 36 Share-based payment charges included in discontinued operations amounted to 4m 2011: 4m.
The Group operates the following equity-settled employee option and share plans: Worldwide Save for Shares Plan Since 1994, the Group has operated a Save-As-You-Earn plan for UK employees.
In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the end of the savings period lapse unconditionally.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six-month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.
Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was first introduced in 2001, renewed in 2006 and again in 2011.
The plan consists of restricted shares.
The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service over a three to five-year period, and in the case of senior management upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in May 2011 and May 2012 vest dependent on relative total shareholder return, return on invested capital and earnings per share growth.
The award was split equally across all three measures.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2011 and 2012 vest depending on continuing service over a three-year period.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the company will match them on a gross basis of up to one matching share for every invested share i. e. the maximum number of matching shares is equal to the number of shares that could have been acquired with the amount of the pre-tax annual bonus taken in invested shares.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups plans are as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share options exercise price share options exercise price 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 3,203 7.15 8,878 10.20 Granted during the year 1,321 9.09 1,157 8.92 Exercised during the year 840 5.59 2,323 7.27 Forfeited during the year 294 7.84 457 8.54 Expired during the year 17 5.60 4,052 14.12 Outstanding at end of year 3,373 8.24 3,203 7.15 Options exercisable at end of year 106 5.58 64 5.54 Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 12.01 2011: 11.14.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.

The number of shares expected to vest is adjusted, based on historical experience, to account for potential forfeitures.
Restricted shares granted under the Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan are valued using the share price at the date of grant.
Participants under both plans are entitled to dividends during the vesting period and therefore the share price is not discounted.
Restricted shares with a market performance condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Restricted shares with a non-market performance condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions are taken into consideration by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
