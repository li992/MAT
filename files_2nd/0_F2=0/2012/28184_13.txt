Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 69 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 30 April 2012 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, which comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Accounting Standards Committee IASC, as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and IFRIC guidance.
The Groups presentational currency is pounds sterling.
Pounds sterling is also the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiary because it is the currency which is most relevant to the majority of the Companys shareholders and creditors and the currency in which the majority of the Groups operating expenses are paid.
The principal accounting policies followed are set out below: 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of Preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modied by the inclusion of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
The financial position of the Group as at 30 April 2012 is shown in the balance sheet on page 67.
As at 30 April 2012 the Groups total assets exceeded its total liabilities by a multiple of over 15.
The assets of the Group consist mainly of securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment policy, as set out on page 39 and these securities are readily realisable.
The Directors consider that the Company has adequate financial resources to enable it to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Groups accounts.
b Basis of Consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its wholly owned subsidiary undertaking, PCT Finance Limited made up to 30 April each year.
In the financial statements of the parent company, investment in the subsidiary is recognised at fair value.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Statement of Comprehensive Income is only presented in consolidated form, as provided by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. c Presentation of Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income In order to better reect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with the guidance set out by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The results presented in the Revenue Return column is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 70 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 30 April 2012 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on an ex-dividend basis.
Special dividends are recognised on an ex-dividend basis and may be considered to be either revenue or capital items.
The facts and circumstances are considered on a case by case basis before a conclusion on appropriate allocation is reached.
Where the Company has received dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any excess in value of shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the capital return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The xed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised under the effective interest rate method.
Bank interest and other income receivable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
The dealing profits of the subsidiary undertaking, representing realised gains and losses on the sale of current asset investments, are dealt with in the Group financial statements as a revenue item.
e Expenses and Finance Costs All expenses, including finance costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis.
All expenses have been presented as revenue items except as follows: any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance: transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed either as part of the unrealised gain loss on investments for acquisition costs or as a deduction from the proceeds of sale for disposal costs.
Finance costs are calculated using the effective interest rate method and are accounted for on an accruals basis.
f Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the overseas withholding tax deducted from investment income, tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 71 Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
g Investments Held at Fair Value Through profit or Loss When a purchase or sale is made under contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date and are initially measured at fair value.
On initial recognition the Group has designated all of its investments as held at fair value through profit or loss as dened by IFRS.
All investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the Companys accounts at fair value.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis and option pricing models.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
Changes in fair value of all investments held at fair value and realised gains and losses on disposal are recognised in the capital return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
h Other Receivables Other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Other receivables do not carry any interest and are short-term in nature and are accordingly stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
i Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
j Other Payables Other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Other payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 72 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 30 April 2012 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued k Bank Loans All bank loans are initially recognised at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition these loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.
The amounts falling due for repayment within one year are included under current liabilities in the Balance Sheet.
l Rates of Exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of each transaction.
Monetary assets, monetary liabilities and equity investments in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on that date.
Realised profits or losses on exchange, together with differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets or liabilities, are taken to the capital return column of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on investments held at fair value are included within changes in fair value.
m Share Capital Represents the nominal value of authorised and allocated, called-up and fully paid shares issued.
n Capital Reserves Capital reserves gains losses on disposal includes: gains losses on disposal of investments exchange differences on currency balances and on settlement of loan balances cost of own shares bought back other capital charges and credits charged to this account in accordance with the accounting policies above Capital reserve revaluation on investments held includes: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments and loans held at the year end.
All of the above are accounted for in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income except the cost of own shares bought back which is accounted for in the Statement of Changes in Equity.
o Derivative Financial Instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Group may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risks arising from the Groups investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio, the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in capital values of the holdings, loan interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to manage interest rate risk.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group.
The use of financial derivatives by the Group does not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS.
As a result changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as they arise.
If capital in nature, associated change in value is presented in the capital return column of the Consolidated Statement of Consolidated Income.
The Group has entered into two oating xed interest rate swap transactions on Yen and US dollars.
The swap allows the variable LIBOR part of the US dollar and Yen loans to be swapped for a xed amount.
The Group uses its interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its Japanese yen and US dollar bank borrowings.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 73 A Japanese yen contract with a nominal value of Y750 million has xed interest payments at a rate of 0.46% and oating interest receipts at Yen LIBOR.
A US dollar contract with a nominal value of $23 million has xed interest payments at a rate of 0.81% and oating interest receipts at USD LIBOR.
The fair value of the swap entered into at 30 April 2012 is estimated as 22,000 in favour of the lender.
Where the fair value of the swap is in favour of the lender it is represented by a creditor on the balance sheet.
If in favour of the company it is represented by a debtor.
Changes in the fair value of the swap are treated as a finance cost and charged 100% to revenue.
The fair value of the swaps is calculated based on mark to market values.
p Segmental Reporting Under IFRS 8, Operating Segments, operating segments are considered to be the components of an entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identied as the Manager with oversight from the Board.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has two business segments, being the parent Company, Polar Capital Technology Trust plc, which has the objective of maximising capital growth for its shareholders through investing in a diversied portfolio of technology companies around the world, and its wholly owned subsidiary, PCT Finance Limited, which trades in securities to enhance Group returns.
An analysis of financial results and balances by business segment is set out in note 30.
The amounts presented for each segment are based on the accounting policies adopted in the Group accounts.
Discrete financial information for these segments is reviewed regularly by the Manager who allocates resources, and the Board who overseas the Managers performance.
In line with IFRS 8, additional disclosure by geographical segment has been provided in note 30.
Further analyses of expenses, investment gains or losses, profit and other assets and liabilities by country have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.
q Key Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The only estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in note 1 g. At the year end, unquoted investments represent 0.2% of net assets.

It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and deficits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company and Group have not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments held by the Company.

Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the company are explained in the accounting policies note on page 69.
There have been no transfers during the year between Levels 1 and 2.
A reconciliation of fair value measurements in Level 3 is set out below.

The Group invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long term to further the investment objective set out on page 39.
This exposes the Group to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the accounts relate.
The Groups exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and xed interest securities which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups operations Derivative transactions which the Group enters into may include equity or index options, index future contracts, forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks, foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from the Groups investment activities.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identied is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 31 a i, currency risk see note 31 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 31 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on the valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Group faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 28 to 35.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies as stated in Note 2 g. At the the year end, the Companys portfolio included two derivative instruments both of which are interest rate swaps.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 91 Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specic to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.

In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 96 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 30 April 2012 31 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may affect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Group nances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Group uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both xed and oating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate prole and manage the exposure to interest rate uctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
The Group has entered into two xed oating interest rate swap transactions on Yen and US dollars.
A Japanese yen contract with a nominal value of Y750 million has xed interest payments at a rate of 0.46% and oating interest receipts at Yen LIBOR.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at 30 April, of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: oating interest rates i. e. giving cash ow interest rate risk - when the rate is due to be re-set: xed interest rates i. e. giving fair value interest rate risk - when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 97 The table below illustrates the Groups sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2012 30 April 2011 Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 48 34 41 27 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 48 34 41 27 Change to shareholders funds 48 34 41 27 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.
b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the possibility of failure of the Group to realise sufficient assets to meet its financial liabilities.
Management of the risk The Groups assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which may be sold to meet funding requirements as necessary.
Liquidity risk exposure The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings are set out in note 19 to the accounts.
Short-term exibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
At 30 April the financial liabilities comprised of: Group Company Group Company 30 April 2012 30 April 2012 30 April 2011 30 April 2011 000 000 000 000 Due within 1 month: Balances due to brokers 4,309 4,309 10,863 10,863 Accruals 1,600 1,600 4,994 4,994 Due after 1 month and within 3 months: Bank loan 10,076 10,076 29,351 29,351 Due after 1 year: Bank loan 20,621 20,621 Interest rate swap 40 40 c Credit Risk Credit risk is the exposure to loss from failure of a counterparty to deliver securities or cash for acquisitions or disposals of investments or to repay deposits.

The Group manages credit risk by using brokers from a database of approved brokers and by dealing through Polar Capital.
All cash balances are held with approved counterparties.
These arrangements were in place throughout the current year and the prior year.
Credit risk exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2012 was 50,401,000 30 April 2011: 55,093,000 comprising: Group Company Group Company 30 April 2012 30 April 2012 30 April 2011 30 April 2011 000 000 000 000 Balances due from brokers 1,091 1,091 9,364 9,364 Accrued income 233 231 355 353 Cash at bank 49,077 43,465 45,374 39,787 50,401 44,787 55,093 49,504 All of the above financial assets are current, their fair values are considered to be the same as the values shown and the likelihood of a material credit default is considered low.
None of the Groups financial assets are past due or impaired.
All deposits were placed with banks that had ratings of A or higher.
The xed oating interest rate swaps are held with a counterparty with a rating of A or higher.
d Gearing risk The Companys policy is to increase its exposure to equity markets through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowings are invested in such markets, the effect is to magnify the impact on Shareholders funds of changes, both positive and negative, in the value of the portfolio.
Management of the risk The Company uses short-term loans to manage gearing risk, details of which can be found in note 19.
Gearing risk exposure The loans are valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method in the financial statements.
The Board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances.
e Capital Management Policies and Procedures The Companys capital, or equity, is represented by its net assets which are managed to achieve the Companys investment objective set out on page 39.
The Board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: i the planned level of gearing through the Companys xed rate loan facility and ii the need to issue or buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes account of the difference between the net asset value per share and the share price ie the level of share price discount or premium.
The Companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The Company is subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the Companies Act with respect to its status as a public company.
In addition in order to pay dividends out of profits available for distribution by way of dividend, the Company has to be able to meet one of the two capital restriction tests imposed on investment companies by company law.
The Company is also subject to externally imposed capital requirements through the loan covenants set out in the loan facility.
These requirements are unchanged since the previous year end and the Company has complied with them.

When shares are disposed of a capital gain may result if the disposal proceeds exceed the sum of the base cost of the shares sold and any other allowable deductions such as share dealing costs.
The exercise of subscription shares or warrants into ordinary shares should not have given rise to a capital gain, however a capital gain may arise on the eventual disposal of those shares.
The calculations required to compute capital gains may be complex and depend on personal circumstances.
Shareholders are advised to consult their personal financial advisor for further information regarding a possible tax liability in respect of their shareholdings.
