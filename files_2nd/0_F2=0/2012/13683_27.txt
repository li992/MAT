Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 69 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 1.
Principal Accounting Policies RPC Group Plc the Company is a company incorporated in England.
Both the Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form part of these approved financial statements.
The following principal accounting policies apply to both the Group and Company financial statements.
They have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Companys financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements, which are presented in sterling, are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention except for derivative financial instruments which are stated at their fair value.
The preparation of the financial statements requires the directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The key estimates and judgements used in the financial statements are as follows: Impairment of tangible and intangible assets Intangible assets are tested at least annually for impairment and the Groups tangible assets other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of International Accounting Standard IAS 39 and deferred tax assets, are tested when there is an indication of impairment in accordance with the accounting policy set out below and in note 11 to the financial statements.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units are determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations require the use of estimates which include cash flow projections for each cash-generating unit and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with individual cash-generating units.
Retirement benefit obligations The costs and present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend upon such factors as life expectancy of the members, wage rate increases of current employees, the returns that the Schemes assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the pension liabilities.
The Group uses estimates based on past experience and actuarial advice in determining these future cash flows and in determining the discount rate.
The accounting policy is set out under Employee Benefits below and details of the assumptions used are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Taxation There are many transactions whose ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.
The Group makes provision for anticipated tax consequences based on the likelihood of whether additional taxes may arise.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on estimates of future taxable income and recoverability.
If these estimates do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which losses might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset or liability will be revised in a future period.
The accounting policy for taxation is set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidation includes the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 March 2012.
Where subsidiaries are acquired during the year, their results are included in the Groups financial statements from the date of control.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control.
The consolidated financial statements include the investment in joint ventures, stated at cost, plus the Groups share of retained post acquisition profits and other changes in net assets.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated from the date the joint venture control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
New standards and interpretations In the current year the Group adopted: Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Revised IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Improvements to IFRS May 2010 Neither the standards nor the interpretations had any significant impact on the financial statements of the Group or Company.
At the date of approval of these financial statements, there were no standards endorsed but not yet adopted by the EU that would have a material impact on the Group results.
RPC Group Plc 70 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost together with any incidental expenses of acquisition less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the assets concerned, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Plant and equipment 5 to 10 years Moulds 3 to 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining the cost of raw materials, consumables and goods for resale, the average purchase price is used.
For finished goods, cost is taken as production cost which includes the cost of the raw materials and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where necessary, provision is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Financial assets Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Group commits to sell the asset, and are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is made when there is evidence such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice.
The carrying amount of the receivable is reduced through use of an allowance account.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
A financial asset or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are stated at the fair value of the consideration given when initially acquired adjusted for capital contributions in respect of share options granted to employees of its subsidiaries and reviewed for impairment if there is an indication that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 71 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Foreign currencies Trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling when the transaction was entered into.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange on the date of the balance sheet.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the balance sheet and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Since converting to IAS and as permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has reported the differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of foreign operations, the effective portion of foreign currency borrowings used in a net investment hedge, and the translation of the results of those companies at the average rate within the translation reserve and has reported the transactions in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Prior to 2005, these items were recognised in retained reserves.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums paid on settlement or redemption of direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value and include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The fair values are determined by reference to the market prices available from the market on which the instruments involved are traded.
Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Groups treasury policy.
Hedges are classified as follows: Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
Net investment hedges that hedge exposure to changes in the value, due to fluctuations in exchange rates, of the Groups interests in the net assets of foreign operations.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the income statement.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge, as defined by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is recognised in equity, directly in the cash flow hedge reserve or the translation reserve, respectively, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
Such hedges are tested, both at inception to ensure they are expected to be effective and periodically throughout their duration to assess continuing effectiveness.
When the forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
Where a Group company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Group considers these to be insurance arrangements for them as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Revenue Revenue, which excludes value added tax, other sales taxes and trade discounts, represents the invoiced value of goods supplied.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when packaging products and associated equipment are supplied to external customers in line with contractual arrangements.
In these instances, significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to third parties, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group.
Government grants Government grants in respect of property, plant and equipment are capitalised and credited to the income statement over the life of the related assets.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the income statement in the year in which the grant is received.
RPC Group Plc 72 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the current taxes payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets at the balance sheet date.
The obligation is calculated by external actuaries using the projected unit method.
The Group has adopted IAS 19 revised and hence actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity and recognised in full in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The costs of providing accrued service benefits, return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities are charged to operating expenses.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Termination benefits The Group recognises the present value of a liability to pay termination benefits when it has a demonstrable commitment to terminating employment before retirement.
In Germany, the Group has contractual obligations under a part-time employment scheme for older employees Altersteilzeit.
In addition to half salary, the employee may receive a fixed incentive payment.
The Group provides for the incentive payment as a termination benefit.
The number of employees who will take up this arrangement is an estimate based on historical experience and any agreed cap on the number of participants.
Actuarial gains and losses and past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other employee benefits The Group provides for the present value of its obligations in respect of other long-term employee benefits using actuarial valuations.
These include deferred salaries due to German Altersteilzeit employees and long service awards.
The Group provides for long service awards as they accrue.
The number of employees who will receive long service awards is estimated based on historical experience.
The costs of short-term employee benefits are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
Leasing Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the income statement, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease.
Research and development expenditure Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Where the expenditure relates to the development of a new product or process which is expected to be technically feasible and commercially viable, development costs are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives, to a maximum of five years.
The intangible assets are assessed for indications of impairment annually and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 73 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Goodwill Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions and represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
The carrying amount is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested at least annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognised immediately as an expense and cannot be reversed subsequently.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 which has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement in the year of acquisition.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use and is calculated on a straight-line basis to allocate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Patents remaining life of patent Product development costs over the life of the project Computer software and IT systems development costs 4 to 5 years Customer contacts and relationships acquired over the life of the relationships The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date.
The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer software, comprises the purchase cost and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use.
Computer software costs that are directly associated with the implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories, financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 and deferred tax assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses in respect of assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Equity-settled share-based payments The Group operates an employee savings related share option scheme and executive share option schemes.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has chosen to adopt IFRS 2 Share-based Payments for share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
On this basis, the fair value of employee share options granted is calculated at grant date using an appropriate option pricing model.
The resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the options with a corresponding increase in equity.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its service and non-market estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable and the charge to the income statement is adjusted accordingly.
Where the Company grants share options to employees of its subsidiaries, the amount equal to the amount which would otherwise have been charged in the income statement in respect of those options is accounted for as a capital contribution and the Companys cost of investment in its subsidiary is increased accordingly.
Related party disclosures Transactions between the Group and any related parties which require disclosure under IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures are given in note 26.

Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Goodwill Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that acquisition.
The Group tests at least annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The CGUs have been determined at cluster level within the Group, and the carrying value of goodwill at 31 March is allocated as follows: 2012 2011 m m UK Injection Moulding 4.9 4.9 Blow Moulding Bramlage-Wiko 3.9 4.2 Bebo 5.2 4.7 Cobelplast 6.0 6.4 Tedeco-Gizeh 1.9 2.8 Superfos 75.4 79.9 97.3 102.9 The directors have determined that no impairment was required at 31 March 2012 as the recoverable amounts were in excess of the carrying value.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from their value in use.
The cash flow projections used in these calculations cover a three year period based on the 2012 13 budget and the outline plans for 2013 14 and 2014 15 approved by the Board together with terminal values which assume zero growth.
The key assumptions used in the recoverable amount calculations include: i Sales.
Forecasts are based on cluster level analysis of sales, markets, competitors and prices for the budget period.
Consideration is given to past experience, knowledge of future contracts and expectations of future potential changes in the markets.
ii Polymer and electricity costs.
Forecasts for polymer costs are based on prices at the time the budget is prepared.
Forecasts for electricity costs are based on contractual arrangements taking into account supply and demand factors.
A pre-tax discount rate of 8% 2011: 10% was used to discount the expected cash flows of the cash-generating units.
As each CGU is considered to have similar risks the same discount rate has been applied.
The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rate.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, an increase in the discount rate to 28% would indicate a potential impairment in one or more of the CGUs.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include customer contracts with a net book value of 3.2m 2011: 4.0m, patents with a net book value of 0.2m 2011: 0.4m and development costs with a net book value of 4.0m 2011: 3.5m.
RPC Group Plc 82 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 12.
The reclassification in 2011 related mainly to acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2003 which were included at their gross values for cost and accumulated depreciation.
The adjustment had been made to ensure that the accounting treatment is consistent with acquisitions after that date and had no impact on the net book value.
The Company had no property, plant and equipment at either year end.
The impairment charge of 7.0m 2011: 0.7m relates to charges taken in association with sites that have been or are in the process of being closed.
The Groups obligations under finance leases see note 18 are secured against the leased assets and have a carrying value at 31 March 2012 of 1.8m 2011: 3.1m.

Derivative Financial Instruments The Groups principal financial instruments other than derivatives are borrowings for the purpose of financing operating activities.
Other financial instruments comprise cash at bank and trade receivables and payables.

Policies and risks associated with derivatives and financial instruments The Groups policies and the risks associated with derivatives and financial instruments are as follows: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will affect the Groups net income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within parameters that are deemed to be acceptable, while optimising return.
Generally, the Group seeks to minimise this risk through hedging arrangements designed to manage a proportion of the Groups overall exposure.
The Group does not actively engage in trading of financial assets for speculative purposes.
b Interest rate risk The Group has bank borrowings mainly in euros and sterling and during the year issued USPP notes denominated in US dollars and euros.
Interest rate swaps are used to reduce the exposure of the Group to fluctuations in interest rates which are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings at the year end is given in note 18.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings after the effect of interest rate swaps would have reduced profits before tax by approximately 1.8m 2011: 1.0m before accounting for exchange differences.
c Liquidity risk In order to improve liquidity and ensure continuity of funding, the Group has a credit agreement with nine recognised international banks providing a 200m multi-currency revolving credit facility, maturing in September 2015.
During the year the Group issued $92m and 35m USPP notes expiring in December 2018 and $124m and 25m USPP notes expiring in December 2021.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through additional overdraft facilities.
d Foreign currency risk Of the Groups net assets, 86.2% 2011: 85.7% before borrowings are in currencies linked with the euro and held by subsidiaries located in mainland Europe.
The Company issued seven year bonds totalling 35.0m and US$40.0m in February 2005 which were repaid in March 2012.
Exchange rate swaps had been entered into for $30.0m to sell euros and buy US dollars in 2012, when the US dollar bonds matured.
These swaps were accounted for as fair value hedges.
During the year the mark to market loss on foreign currency hedging instruments taken to the income statement was 0.1m 2011: loss 0.6m and the exchange difference on the related bonds was a gain of nil 2011: gain 1.6m.
In December 2011 the Company issued $216m and 60m fixed rate USPP notes.
In order to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange exposure, 10 cross currency interest swaps were taken out totalling $200m.
These swapped $100m fixed rate into euro fixed rate, and $100m fixed rate into euro variable floating rate finance, including a change of principle currencies that will reverse on redemption.
In order to achieve hedge effectiveness these derivatives were designated into cash flow hedges for the US dollar sterling foreign exchange exposure and fair value hedges for the interest rate element as appropriate and a net investment hedge of the sterling euro foreign exchange exposure.
The remaining $16m and 60m were designated as net investment hedges.
During the year the mark to market gain on foreign currency hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges taken to the income statement was 0.6m and the fair value adjustment on the related USPP notes was a loss of 0.6m.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings to provide a hedge against foreign net investments.
The exchange gains or losses on these borrowings are included in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is minimised by trading in the subsidiaries local currencies wherever possible, by intra-group hedges and by the use of forward exchange contracts as appropriate.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates on the translation of profits earned by its overseas subsidiaries.
The estimated impact of the change in average exchange rates between 2011 and 2012 on the profit before tax would have resulted in a net reduction to the 2012 result of approximately 0.8m 2011: net improvement of 0.8m.
The main currency that drives this change is the euro.
Movements in US dollar and other exchange rates were less significant.
RPC Group Plc 88 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 20.
Derivative Financial Instruments continued e Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counter-party fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from amounts receivable from customers and deposits of cash made with financial institutions.
The Group monitors its credit risk with its customers and only uses financial institutions as counter-parties that have an investment grade credit rating.
The methods used to evaluate customers credit worthiness are described in more detail in note 16.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of Directors monitors both the demographic spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital employed and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board encourages wide employee participation and motivation through equity based incentive schemes.
Details of the current Sharesave and Executive Share Option Schemes and the Performance Share Plan, together with shareholding guidelines, are given in the Remuneration report.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Company is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the Groups net debt is shown in note 18.
The Groups floating rate loans bear interest based on Libor or Euribor.
The floating rate borrowings under the banking facilities are typically rolled over for a period of three months or less, based on the appropriate Libor Euribor rate.
During the year the Group had in place floating to fixed interest rate swaps for euros and US dollars.
At the year end, two swaps remained in place for a total nominal value of 25.0m 2011: 78.7m with maturity dates ranging from April 2012 to March 2014 and at fixed rates between 1.812% and 2.468%.
The market value of these interest rate swaps at the year end was 0.6 m 2011: 0.5 m. With respect to the USPP notes, $100m of the $216m issued in December 2011 was converted from fixed US dollar to floating euro by the use of five cross currency interest rate swaps: three of these swaps totalling $50m expire in December 2018 with the remaining two, totalling $50m, expiring in December 2021.
These were in place at the year end with a market value of 7.9m 2011: nil.
An increase of 1% in the interest rate charged during the year on borrowings not fixed by interest rate swaps would have reduced profit before tax by approximately 1.8m 2011: 1.0m before accounting for exchange differences, and would reduce net equity by approximately 1.4m 2011: 0.7m.
The range of interest rates applicable to financial liabilities net of derivatives by principal currency is as follows: 2012 2011 Sterling Euro US dollar Sterling Euro UD dollar % % % % % % Fixed interest rate n a 2.34.8 2.54.8 n a 2.3 2.5 Floating rate interest margin above: Euribor n a 0.91.6 n a n a 0.51.6 n a Libor 1.41.6 n a 0.9 0.51.6 n a n a Interest received on cash balances is at normal commercial floating rates.
The Group previously received a loan from the Italian Government of 3.4m at an interest rate of 0.89%, which is repayable in December 2013.
The fair value of the loan is 3.1m.
Interest has been charged to the income statement reflecting the Groups average rate of borrowings in euros.
Currency exposures In order to help mitigate the risk on translation of the value of non-UK operations into sterling for reporting purposes, a proportion of debt is borrowed in currencies which match or are closely linked to the currencies of those overseas operations.
As at 31 March 2012 non-derivative financial instruments amounting to 179.8m 2011: 167.1m were designated by the Group as net investment hedges in its subsidiaries, primarily in the Eurozone and USA.
During the year nil 2011: nil was taken to the income statement relating to any inefficiency of this net investment hedge.
A movement of 1% in the value of sterling against other foreign currencies mainly the euro would result in a translational impact on the Groups profit before tax of approximately 0.5m 2011: 0.2m and on the Groups net assets of 1.9m 2011: 1.9m.
The closing rate of exchange for the euro at 31 March 2012 was 1.20 2011: 1.13 and for the US dollar was $1.60 2011: $1.61.
The average rate of exchange for the euro for 2012 was 1.16 2011: 1.18 and for the US dollar $1.60 2011: $1.56.

The carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure of the Group.
The fair values of the interest rate, foreign currency and cross currency interest rate swaps have been determined by reference to the market price available from the market on which the instruments are traded.
In both 2012 and 2011, all financial instruments measured at fair value are categorised as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, whereby the fair value is determined using valuation techniques.
The Group does not hold any Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.
The movement on the fair value of the interest rate and cross currency interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges is debited or credited to equity in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
During the year 0.3m 2011: nil movement in the cash flow hedging reserve before tax was a result of new cash flow hedges relating to the USPP notes and 0.2m 2011: 0.8m relating to existing interest rate swaps.
During the year a loss of 0.4m 2011: loss 0.9m was recycled through the profit and loss account relating to cash flow hedges.
The movement of the fair value of the foreign currency and cross currency interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges is debited or credited to the income statement.
Gains and losses on hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are recognised in the financial statements.
During the period the net loss from financial instruments entered into totalled 0.4m 2011: loss 0.9m.
A gain of 0.2m will arise in the year ending 31 March 2013 assuming interest rates remain at year end levels.

The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary shares and provisions relating to the transfer of ordinary shares are set out in the Companys Articles of Association and governed by statute.
All ordinary shares rank equally regarding dividends, votes and return of capital.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive shareholder notices and other documents and information and to attend, speak and exercise voting rights, either in person or by proxy, at general meetings of the Company.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary shares where the required proof of title has not been provided or transfer documents have not been lodged in an acceptable manner or form.
There are no restrictions on the voting rights of holders of ordinary shares and there are no agreements that are known to the Company between shareholders which may result in such restrictions.
The options granted under the Companys savings related and executive share option schemes are satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares.
Therefore, employees do not hold any voting rights until the shares are allotted on exercise of their options.
The Company has established the RPC Group Employee Benefit Trust to satisfy awards made under the Performance Share Plan and a share matching award.
The independent trustee has the same rights as any other shareholder in respect of any shares held by the trust except in respect of dividends.
On 24 January 2011, the Company issued 62,069,640 ordinary shares by way of a 5 for 8 rights issue at a price of 143p per share under an authority given to the directors at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 6 January 2011.
The net proceeds of the rights issue were 85.3m after costs of 3.5m.
The nominal value of the shares issued of 3.1m was credited to share capital and the remaining net proceeds were credited to the share premium account.
Under the Companies Act 2006, a company is no longer required to have an authorised share capital.
At the Annual General Meeting held on 21 July 2010, the Company removed the provision for an authorised share capital from its Memorandum of Association and adopted new Articles of Association incorporating the effect of this and other changes.
The interests of the directors in the ordinary shares of the Company are shown in the Remuneration report.
Share-based payments The Company operates savings related and executive share option schemes, a Performance Share Plan and an individual share matching agreement, which are all equity-settled share-based payment schemes.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle employee share options or share awards in cash.
Share options Invitations under the Sharesave Scheme a savings related share option scheme are made to eligible employees in the UK and participating mainland European countries.
The exercise price of the options granted is the market price of the shares at the close of business on the day preceding the invitation date less 20%.
Options are normally exercisable for a period of six months starting three years after the related savings contract begins, provided a participant remains an employee of the Group and completes the three year savings contract.
Executive share options are granted to managers and, in the past, executive directors at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors.
The exercise price is normally the market price at the close of business on the day preceding the date of grant.
Options are exercisable between three and ten years after the date of grant provided the participant remains an employee of the Group and, for executive directors, targets for earnings per share growth are met.
Further information on these schemes is given in the Remuneration report.

Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the funded plans at 31 March 2012.

Employee Benefits continued The mortality assumptions used allow for future mortality improvements in valuing the defined benefit obligations and are based on standard mortality tables used by the actuarial profession in the relevant countries adjusted, where appropriate, to reflect the circumstances of the relevant schemes membership.
In the UK the mortality assumptions applied as at 31 March 2012 in respect of the main pension scheme are based on the S1PXA tables, as adopted by the UK actuarial profession, using each individual members year of birth with a scaling factor of 100% and allowance for future mortality improvements of 80% of the Long Cohort for males and 60% of the Long Cohort for females subject to a minimum annual improvement of 1.25% for both males and females.
The life expectancies from the age of 65 of scheme members assumed at the balance sheet date in years were as follows: 2012 2011 UK UK Current age: Aged 65: Male 22 22 Female 24 24 Aged 45: Male 25 24 Female 27 26 The most sensitive assumption used to determine the defined benefit obligations of the Group is the discount rate.
An increase of 0.1% in the discount rate would result in a decrease in the Groups defined benefit obligations of 1.8% and a decrease in the discount rate of 0.1% would result in an increase of 1.9% in the Groups defined benefit obligations.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
In the UK, the Netherlands and Norway these are contributory with funds held separately from the finances of the Group either by trustee-administered funds or by insurance contracts.
Funded retirement benefit obligations United Kingdom The main retirement benefit obligation in the UK is a defined benefit pension scheme, called the RPC Containers Limited Pension Scheme.
This provides retirement benefits to some former employees and approximately 33% 2011: 37% of current UK employees.
The scheme provides members with benefits based on a three-year average of final pensionable salary and total pensionable service.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trusteeadministered fund to meet long-term liabilities for past and present employees.
The corporate trustee, which is independent from the Group, has a duty to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustee directors is determined by the schemes corporate and trust documentation and by statute.
All trustee directors are members of the pension scheme and one-third are nominated by current and pensioner members.
Subject to statute, the principal employer, RPC Containers Limited, on the advice of the scheme actuary and in consultation with the trustee, determines the contributions to the scheme.
In addition, in the event that any of the members employing companies are unable to pay their contributions, the trustee may call upon guarantees provided by RPC Group Plc in respect of certain present and future liabilities of the members employing companies in the UK.
This pension scheme was closed to new entrants and to existing members for future service accrual on 31 July 2010 and was replaced with a contract based defined contribution pension plan for future service.
The scheme had separate sections with accrual rates of 1 60th per year of service and 1 80th per year of service.
Member contributions were 11% and 6.6% of pensionable salary for the respective sections and the overall employer contribution was 14.5% of pensionable salaries up to the closure date.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 on accounting for employee benefits as at 31 March 2012 was 25.3m 2011: 23.0m.
The last completed triennial valuation performed by an independent actuary for the trustee of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2009.
The valuation, which is calculated on an ongoing funding basis and is different from that prescribed by IAS 19, showed a deficit of 45.9m.
This had reduced to an estimated 31.1m at 31 March 2011 according to the annual actuarial report by the scheme actuary.
In addition to the closure of the scheme, the Company agreed to make two one-off lump sum contributions of 5m each in September 2010 and April 2011, make contributions to cover the schemes expenses and pay monthly deficit reduction contributions of 1.8m each year increasing by 3% per annum with the aim of eliminating the deficit over 13.2 years from 1 August 2010.
Previously the deficit reduction contributions had been approximately 0.5m per annum.
RPC Group Plc also agreed to a limited extension to the guarantee provided in respect of certain present and future liabilities of the members employing companies.
As a result of the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s, the Group acquired two closed trustee-administered defined benefit pension arrangements in the UK providing benefits based on final pensionable salary and pensionable service.
The Superfos Runcorn Limited Pension Fund was closed to future accrual on 5 April 2010.
The deficit in the fund calculated in accordance with IAS 19 as at 31 March 2012 was 2.8m 2011: 1.8m.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2010 showed a funding deficit of 2.5m.
The defined benefit section of the Peerless Limited Pension Scheme was closed to future accrual in 1994.
The IAS 19 accounting deficit at 31 March 2012 was 0.9m 2011: 0.8m.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 August 2010 showed a funding deficit of 1.1m.
The Company agreed to pay combined annual deficit reduction contributions and expenses for both plans of 0.4m increasing by an allowance for inflation each year.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation in the financial statements was measured using the projected unit credit method based on the last actuarial valuation for IAS 19 purposes allowing for IAS 19 financial assumptions and any further improvements in life expectancy.
Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information RPC Group Plc 101 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 The Netherlands In the Netherlands there are a number of defined benefit retirement plans.
These are funded by contributions to insurance policies or a separately administered fund.
There were five pension plans in the Netherlands providing career average four plans or final salary one plan pensions and disability benefits under contracts with insurance companies.
Members pay a fixed amount of their salary in contributions and the employing companys contributions are adjusted annually by the insurance company based on the funding level.
The IAS 19 liability and service cost are calculated by local actuaries by rolling forward the latest data available from the insurance companies and current salary data from the relevant RPC subsidiary.
Following the closure of Halfweg and Ravenstein during the 2009 financial year, their plans became fully funded and consequently the deficits reduced to nil.
One of the plans was acquired as a result of the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s in respect of a former business in the Netherlands and current Dutch employees of Superfoss German operation.
The deficit recognised in the balance sheet at 31 March 2012 in respect of all continuing plans was 3.1m 2011: 2.7m.
The separately administered RPC Tedeco-Gizeh Deventer Pension Plan was closed with effect from 1 January 2007 and all accrued past service benefits and certain early retirement benefits were transferred to the Dutch Plastics Industry Pension Plan.
As part of the arrangements, RPC agreed to make additional contributions to make up the deficit in the funding of certain early retirement and pre-pension benefits.
A curtailment gain of 0.2m was recognised during the year as a result of the planned withdrawal from the vending cups business.
The deficit included in the retirement benefit obligations as at 31 March 2012 was 0.1m 2011: 0.4m.
Unfunded retirement benefit obligations Most of the Groups German operations provide non-contributory pension plans financed by balance sheet provisions calculated by a local actuary on an annual basis according to local requirements.
There is no external funding for these plans although they are secured by insolvency insurance required under German law.
In general, the plans provide a fixed retirement benefit not related to salaries and are closed to new entrants.
Pension increases are granted every three years based on price inflation.
The IAS 19 liability and service cost are based on the annual valuation provided by the local actuary using the projected unit method.
All the Groups subsidiaries in France, including those acquired in the acquisition of Superfos Industries a s, provide unfunded retirement indemnities according to the applicable collective agreement.
The benefit takes the form of a lump sum payable on reaching retirement age.
During the year ended 31 March 2009, a change in the indemnities payable under the Plasturgie collective agreement, which applied to four of the Groups operations at the time, resulted in an unrecognised past service cost which is being amortised over the expected period to vesting.
RPCs Italian businesses are required to provide termination benefits payable on leaving service, including retirement.
The termination benefit amounts to one months deferred pay per year of service revalued each year.
For RPC Superfos Italy, a small sales office, this benefit continues to accrue.
For employees of the larger RPC Cobelplast Montonate, service accrual ceased from 1 January 2007 when new regulations replaced this benefit with defined contribution pension arrangements.
The current and revalued past service liability included in the defined benefit obligation as at 31 March 2012 was 0.6m 2011: 0.6m.
The Groups operations in Poland are required to provide for a retirement indemnity of one months salary for employees who have worked for at least 25 years for any employer.
Disability and mandatory death benefits are also provided.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 3.8m 2011: 8.8m to its defined benefit plans in the next financial year.
This includes proposed contributions to the main UK pension scheme described above of 2.3m 2011: 7.2m.
Multi-employer plans Certain Group employees in the Netherlands and Sweden participate in multi-employer or industry-wide defined benefit pension plans as follows: Number of current employees participating Pension Plan Name 2012 2011 Stichting Beheer  OWASE 136 144  Branche Pensioenregeling Dutch Plastics Industry Plan 95 100 Swedish ITP2 Plan 22 19 The Group is not a significant participant in any of these plans.
In respect of all three multi-employer plans, there is no contractual agreement between the multi-employer plan and their participants that would determine how any surpluses or deficits will be distributed or funded.
Employer contributions are fixed by the plans governing bodies for all participating employers.
It is not possible to separately identify within the plans the assets and liabilities which relate to RPC Group employees.
Therefore, the Group accounts for the plans as defined contribution arrangements.
RPC Group Plc 102 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 2012 25.

The employer contributions are 22.5% of pensionable salary.
The latest information available on the funding status of the OWASE plan on the local funding valuation basis according to Dutch law indicates that the plan is in surplus.
Therefore, contributions for RPC are expected to remain at the current level.
The Plastics Industry Plan is a funded, defined benefit, career weighted average salary scheme providing benefits at the rate of 2.15% per annum of pensionable earnings.
The employer contribution was 10.5% of pensionable earnings from 1 January 2010 and an increase to 15% from 1 July 2012 is planned.

Employees of RPC Superfos in Sweden participate in the ITP2 Plan.
This is a multi-employer plan for salaried employees working in private industry and commerce, established under the collective agreement negotiated by the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and with the cartel PTK .
The ITP2 Plan provides defined benefits based on final salary, including retirement, long term disability and survivors pensions.
The pension level is around 65% of pay inclusive of social security for the average employee.
The Plan is insured with the insurer Alecta.
Employees do not contribute to the Plan and employer contributions are calculated individually in relation to age and salary level at rates selected by Alecta.
The latest information available on the funding status of the ITP2 Plan is shown in the table below.
As the Plan is in surplus, no increase in contributions is expected.
The latest published funding levels and date on which they were measured are as follows: 2012 2011 Date Funding Level Date Funding Level OWASE 31 December 2011 104.0% 31 December 2010 116.8% Plastics Industry Plan 31 December 2010 110.1% 31 December 2009 114.2% ITP2 Plan 31 March 2012 124.0% 31 December 2010 146.0% The expense recognised in the Consolidated income statement for these multi-employer plans is equal to the contributions due for the year and is not included in the above retirement benefit obligations.
