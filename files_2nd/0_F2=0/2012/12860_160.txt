The effective tax rate is expected to remain below the UK statutory rate in the medium term, subject to any tax legislation changes and the geographic mix of profits.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and a further reduction to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 30 March 2012.
This will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 March 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 24% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax asset accordingly.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had unused tax losses of 200.0m 2011: 188.7m potentially available for offset against future profits.
