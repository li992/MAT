5 Capital expenditure Capital and exploration expenditure are both important in pursuing our strategy.
Capital and exploration expenditure is disclosed for each CSG in the table below presented on an accruals basis.
The most significant increase over the three years has been in Petroleum, with other significant increases in Iron Ore, Metallurgical Coal and Base Metals.

Exploration expenditure is capitalised in accordance with our accounting policies, as set out in note 1 Accounting policies in the financial statements.
All other exploration expenditure is expensed in the period.
Capital expenditure encompasses expenditure on major projects, as set out in section 3.7.
2, and capital expenditure on sustaining and other items.

The Group has a portfolio of development options beyond those projects in execution and a significant number of these are embedded within our existing footprint.
As our current capital expenditure commitments decline, future capital will be allocated to those options that maximise shareholder value, while also considering the balance between shortand long-term returns.
In reviewing our rate of forward capital deployment, we have made the following decisions regarding our major projects: We will investigate an alternative, less capital-intensive design of the Olympic Dam, Australia, open-pit expansion, involving new technologies, to substantially improve the economics of the project.
We will delay indefinitely the 2.5 million tonnes per annum mtpa 100 per cent basis expansion of Peak Downs associated with the Caval Ridge mine development, Australia.
We have slowed down work on the Western Australia Iron Ore WAIO Outer Harbour project at Port Hedland, Australia, and shifted our focus to maximising the potential capacity of the Inner Harbour.
We will seek to adjust our rate of forward capital deployment in line with our forward estimate of cash flow generation.
No major project approvals are expected during FY2013.
6 Exploration and development of resources Most of our revenues and profits are related to our oil and gas and minerals operations, therefore our results and financial condition are directly related to the success of our exploration efforts and our ability to replace existing reserves.
However, there are no guarantees that our exploration program will be successful.
When we identify an economic deposit, there are often significant challenges and hurdles entailed in its development, such as negotiating rights to extract ore with governments and landowners, design and construction of required infrastructure, utilisation of new technologies in processing and building customer support.
Exploration expense represents that portion of exploration expenditure that is not capitalised in accordance with our accounting policies, as set out in note 1 Accounting policies to the financial statements.
