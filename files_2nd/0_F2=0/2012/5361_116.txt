Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables level 3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread, and were as follows: 2012 2011 per cent per cent Derivatives 4.1 7.8 4.1 7.1 Borrowings 2.6 2.9 2.6 2.9 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 ELEMENTIS PLC SHAREHOLDER 106 108 FINANCIAL 62 105 CORPORATE 36 61 BUSINESS 04 35 COMPANY IFC 03 INFORMATION STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE REVIEW OVERVIEW
