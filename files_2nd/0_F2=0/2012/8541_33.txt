The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the Group going concern disclosure on page 67.
These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with Companies Act 2006 and United.
ingdom Accounting Standards and have been applied consistently.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fi[ed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for any impairment.
Intangible assets Trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are up to 20 years.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
TraGe Gebtors anG creGitors Trade debtors and creditors are stated at their nominal value.
Trade debtors are reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borroZings Bank overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accrual basis to profit or loss.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Taxation Current ta[, including U. corporation ta[ and foreign ta[, is provided at amounts e[pected to be paid or recovered using the ta[ rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred ta[ is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more ta[ in the future or a right to pay less ta[ in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups ta[able profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in ta[ assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred ta[ asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the e[tent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable ta[able profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred ta[ is not recognised when [ed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss e[pected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred ta[ recognised when [ed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the ta[able gain will be rolled over, being charged to ta[ only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred ta[ is measured at the average ta[ rates that are e[pected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are e[pected to reverse, based on ta[ rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
