1.8 Exceptional other gain The exceptional other gain represents the gain arising from step acquisition accounting of the DMS joint venture.
This requires that, before accounting for the purchase of the remaining 50%, the original 50% shareholding held at book value in Sercos accounts is restated to fair value.
The revaluation of this original 50% is recognised in the consolidated income statement, which resulted in a 51.1m non-cash exceptional gain.
1.9 Investment revenue and finance costs Investment revenue and finance costs totalled a net cost of 36.7m 2011: 27.9m, an increase of 8.8m.
The increase excluding currency effects was 9.6m.
The principal driver of the cost increase was the full year effect of additional loans raised in the prior year to finance acquisition activity.
For 2013, net finance costs are anticipated to be approximately 45-50m including the impact from the forthcoming revision to IAS 19: this would represent a slight increase on the equivalent 2012 restated net finance cost.
Excluding exceptional items the effective rate was 25.0% 2011: 26.5%.
Excluding exceptional and other adjusting items, the effective rate was 24.6% 2011: 25.9%.
The decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in the mix of taxable profits and the impact of the reduction in the UK headline tax rate from 26% to 24% on 1 April 2012.
1.11 Earnings per share EPS Adjusted EPS rose by 7.5% to 42.55p 8.7% excluding currency effects.
EPS grew 39.9% to 49.94p while EPS excluding exceptional items grew by 6.7% to 38.09p.
EPS and Adjusted EPS are calculated on an average share base of 491.2m during the year 2011: 490.5m.
1.12 Expected impact of changes to accounting standards In 2013 there will be two significant changes to accounting under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS which will affect Sercos 2013 results and require the restatement of 2012 comparative gures.
These relate to changes in the joint venture accounting rules IFRS 11 and to the pension accounting rules IAS 19 revised.
The change to joint venture accounting rules IFRS 11 will remove the option for proportional consolidation of joint ventures and require equity accounting for joint ventures instead.
The estimated effect on the 2012 results for this change would be to reduce statutory reported revenue by 852.9m and profit before tax by 15.1m.
There is no impact on post tax profits, earnings per share, or net assets from this change.
In addition to the statutory measures, the 2013 income statement will also disclose revenue and Adjusted operating profit including the proportional share of joint venture results, to provide consistency in the presentation of the results.
The change to the pension accounting rules IAS 19 revised will principally require pension interest return to be calculated using the value of scheme assets multiplied by the discount rate rather than the expected rate of asset return.
After accounting for IFRS11, the additional estimated effect on the 2012 results for this change reduces Adjusted pre tax profits by 6.5m.
2. Dividend The Board is confident in the future growth prospects for the Group and of the strong financial position that we have.
We therefore intend progressively to increase the payout ratio and thereby reduce our dividend cover over the next three years.
Beyond that point, we anticipate a policy of maintaining dividend cover of between 2.5 and 3 times and therefore reverting to increasing the total dividend each year broadly in line with the increase in underlying earnings.
The Board has proposed a final dividend for 2012 of 7.45p per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 10.10p, up 20% compared with the previous year.
This represents a payout of 24% based on 42.55p of Adjusted earnings per share, or dividend cover of 4.2 times.
The final dividend will be paid, subject to shareholder approval, on 22 May 2013 to shareholders on the register on 15 March 2013.
