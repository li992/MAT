Goodwill m At 1 January 2011 899.5 Additions 357.8 Exchange differences 1.7 At 1 January 2012 1,259.0 Additions 162.6 Disposals 86.8 Exchange differences 22.5 At 31 December 2012 1,312.3 Goodwill is attributable to the excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired and includes expected synergies, future growth prospects, staff knowledge, expertise and customer contacts.
Additions during the year relate to goodwill recognised on four acquisitions.
More details of these acquisitions are presented in the Acquisitions note note 17.
The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Goodwill has been allocated to CGUs in the following operating segments: 2011 2012 Restated m m UK & Europe 280.3 367.0 Americas 393.2 411.3 AMEAA 134.3 31.3 Global Services 504.5 449.4 At 31 December 1,312.3 1,259.0 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use discounted cash ow projections based on financial plans approved by senior management covering a five-year period, and include a terminal value based on the projections for the final year of that plan, with a growth rate assumption applied.
The key assumptions affecting the CGUs within each operating segment are discussed below.
Short-term growth rates Short-term revenue growth rates used in each CGU five-year plan are based on internal data regarding the current pipeline of opportunities and published industry forecasts for the relevant market.
Further discussion of the Groups order book and pipeline is provided in the Our Business and Our Performance sections.

Goodwill continued Terminal growth rates The cash ows subsequent to the five-year period are based upon managements estimate of the growth rates of the sectors in which the CGUs operate.
Where possible these have been derived with reference to external sources.
The range of terminal growth rates applied to the CGUs within each operating segment are set out below: 2012 2011 % % UK & Europe 2.5 2.5 Americas 2.7 3.0 AMEAA 2.53.5 2.53.5 Global Services 5.0 2.57.0 These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates forecast for the individual market sectors.
Discount rate Pre-tax discount rates, derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital have been used in discounting the projected cash ows.
These rates are adjusted for risks specic to the market in which the CGU operates, including but not limited to: geographic and economic risks: contract length: and customer type.
The range of pre-tax discount rates applied to the CGUs within each operating segment are disclosed below: 2012 2011 % % UK & Europe 8.08.4 8.89.1 Americas 9.0 9.9 AMEAA 9.5 10.4 Global Services 10.5 9.112.2 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and, except as noted below, the Directors have not identied any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, to exceed the recoverable amount.
Across the identied CGUs an increase in the discount rate of 1% would not cause the operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount in any CGU, with the exception of the Americas CGU where a 1% increase in the discount rate would result in an impairment of 30m.
Across the identied CGUs a decrease in the terminal growth rate of 1% would not cause the operating assets to exceed their recoverable amount in any CGU, with the exception of the Americas CGU where a 1% decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an impairment of 6m.
