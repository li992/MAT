Historically, the major schemes have been of the dened benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest dened benefit schemes are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benets dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benets are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various dened benefit pension schemes.
The dened benefit pension expense for each year is based on the assumptions and scheme valuations set at 31 December of the prior year.
As at 31 December 2012 2011 2010 Discount rate 4.4% 5.2% 5.6% Expected rate of return on scheme assets n a 6.2% 6.8% Expected rate of salary increases 3.2% 3.5% 4.1% Ination 2.7% 2.9% 3.2% Future pension increases 2.8% 2.9% 3.2% The discount rate is set by reference to AA corporate bond yields.
The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices and market expectations of real rates of return.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing dened benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the dened benefit obligations are set out below: AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY AT 31 DECEMBER 2012 2011 Male Female Male Female years years years years Member currently aged 60 88 88 88 87 Member currently aged 45 89 89 89 88 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 108 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 5 Pension schemes continued The pension expense recognised within the income statement comprises: 2012 2011 m m Service cost including settlement and curtailment credits of 20m 2011: 9m 43 57 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 196 201 Expected return on scheme assets 221 235 Net dened benefit pension expense 18 23 Dened contribution pension expense 46 39 Total pension expense 64 62 The amount recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of dened benefit pension schemes at the start and end of the year and the movements during the year were as follows: 2012 2011 Dened Fair value Net Dened Fair value Net benefit of scheme pension benefit of scheme pension obligations assets obligations obligations assets obligations m m m m m m At start of year 3,876 3,634 242 3,677 3,507 170 Service cost 43 43 57 57 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 196 196 201 201 Expected return on scheme assets 221 221 235 235 Actuarial loss gain 416 87 329 78 35 113 Contributions by employer 116 116 6666 Contributions by employees 11 11 11 11 Benets paid 216 216 141 141 Exchange translation differences 54 47 7 7 9 2 At end of year 4,272 3,806 466 3,876 3,634 242 The net pension obligations of 466m 2011: 242m at 31 December 2012 comprise schemes in deficit with net pension obligations of 466m 2011: 242m and schemes in surplus with net pension assets of nil 2011: nil.
As at 31 December 2012 the dened benefit obligations comprise 4,112m 2011: 3,721m in relation to funded schemes and 160m 2011: 155m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of dened benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years 2011: 19 years.
Deferred tax assets of 153m 2011: 86m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme deficits.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, ination and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, ination and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual service cost and the dened benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual service cost 5 Decrease increase in dened benefit pension obligations 195 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual service cost 1 Increase decrease in dened benefit pension obligations 104 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected ination rate: Increase decrease in annual service cost 3 Increase decrease in dened benefit pension obligations 113 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 110 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 6 Share based remuneration Reed Elsevier provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to directors and employees.

This increase is caused by a change in the relative profitability of the consolidated entities in the countries in which they operate, partially offset by the impact of the reduction in the tax rate of the United Kingdom see below.
During 2012, Reed Elsevier resolved a number of significant prior year tax matters and reassessed its exposure to other tax matters across the jurisdictions in which Reed Elsevier operates.
As a result of this reassessment, current tax liabilities were reduced by 96m to reect the lower cash tax expected to be payable.
On the basis of its size and nature, this exceptional credit has been excluded from adjusted earnings.
The following tax has been recognised directly in equity during the year: 2012 2011 m m Tax on actuarial movements on dened benefit pension schemes 102 36 Tax on fair value movements on cash ow hedges 19 5 Tax credit on share based remuneration 5 1 Net tax credit recognised directly in equity 88 42 A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system, including reductions of the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012, and from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013, were substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
Reed Elsevier has therefore remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 23%, which has resulted in recognition of a deferred tax debit of 1m in the income statement.
The UK government has also announced an intention to reduce the rate of corporation tax to 21% by 1 April 2014, but as this change had not been substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position, the effect on deferred tax has not been recognised in these financial statements.
It is not currently anticipated that theproposed reduction in rate would have a significant impact on deferred tax balances.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2012 115 10 Adjusted gures Reed Elsevier uses adjusted gures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted gures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs, disposal gains and losses and other non operating items, related tax effects, exceptional prior year tax credits in 2012 only, see note 9 and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term and include the benefit of tax amortisation where available on acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration, professional and other transaction related fees, and adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating cash ow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to prior year exceptional restructuring programmes and acquisition related costs.
Adjusted gures are derived as follows: 2012 2011 m m Operating profit 1,358 1,205 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 329 359 Acquisition related costs 21 52 Share of profit on disposals in joint ventures 1 Reclassication of tax in joint ventures 5 11 Adjusted operating profit 1,713 1,626 profit before tax 1,187 948 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 329 359 Acquisition related costs 21 52 Reclassication of tax in joint ventures 5 11 Disposals and other non operating items 45 21 Adjusted profit before tax 1,497 1,391 profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 1,069 760 Adjustments post tax : Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 336 355 Acquisition related costs 16 33 Disposals and other non operating items 103 16 Exceptional prior year tax credit 96 Deferred tax credits on acquired intangible assets not expected to crystallise in the near term 84 104 Adjusted profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 1,138 1,060 Cash generated from operations 1,847 1,735 Dividends received from joint ventures 20 33 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 70 85 Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 7 7 Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets 263 265 Payments in relation to exceptional restructuring costs 25 52 Payments in relation to acquisition related costs 37 38 Adjusted operating cash ow 1,603 1,515 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 116 NOTES TO THE COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the combined financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 11 Statement of cash ows RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE JOINT VENTURES TO CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS 2012 2011 m m Operating profit before joint ventures 1,334 1,175 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 328 355 Amortisation of internally developed intangible assets 151 132 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 76 75 Share based remuneration 31 27 Total non cash items 586 589 Decrease in inventories and pre-publication costs 21 32 Decrease increase in receivables 4 37 Decrease in payables 98 24 Increase in working capital 73 29 Cash generated from operations 1,847 1,735 CASH FLOW ON ACQUISITIONS 2012 2011 Note m m Purchase of businesses 12 276 455 Investment in joint ventures 10 1 Deferred payments relating to prior year acquisitions 30 25 Total 316 481 RECONCILIATION OF NET BORROWINGS Related Cash and derivative cash financial equivalents Borrowings instruments 2012 2011 m m m m m At start of year 726 4,282 123 3,433 3,455 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents 72 72 44 Net movement in short term bank loans, overdrafts and commercial paper 434 434 210 Issuance of other loans 592 592 Repayment of other loans 437 437 248 Repayment of finance leases 44 22 Change in net borrowings resulting from cash ows 72 283 211 16 Borrowings in acquired businesses 18 Inception of finance leases 13 13 8 Fair value and other adjustments to borrowings and related derivatives 4 5 1 8 Exchange translation differences 13 124 4 107 24 At end of year 641 3,892 124 3,127 3,433 Net borrowings comprise cash and cash equivalents, loan capital, finance leases, promissory notes, bank and other loans, and those derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge the fair value of xed rate borrowings.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2012 117 12 Acquisitions During the year a number of acquisitions were made for a total consideration of 341m 2011: 492m, after taking account of net cash acquired of 12m 2011: 24m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisionalfair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below: Fair Fair value value 2012 2011 m m Goodwill 165 300 Intangible assets 229 311 Property, plant & equipment 1 1 Current assets 21 23 Current liabilities 61 46 Borrowings 18 Current tax 2 1 Deferred tax 16 78 Net assets acquired 341 492 Consideration after taking account of 12m 2011: 24m net cash acquired 341 492 Less: consideration deferred to future years 23 27 Less: acquisition date fair value of equity interest 42 10 Net cash ow 276 455 Goodwill, being the excess of the consideration over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, represents benets which do not qualify for recognition as intangible assets, including the ability of a business to generate higher returns than individual assets, skilled workforces, acquisition synergies that are specic to Reed Elsevier, and high barriers to market entry.
In addition, goodwill arises on therecognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2013 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2011.
The businesses acquired in 2012 contributed 73m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 18m, increased adjusted net profit by 14m, decreased reported net profit by 10m, and contributed 2m to net cash inow from operating activities for the part yearunder Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition nancing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at thebeginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net profit and reported netprot for the year would have been 6,153m, 1,717m, 1,142m and 1,073m respectively before taking account of acquisition nancing costs.

The directors of Reed Elsevier PLC have proposed a final dividend of 17.0p 2011: 15.9p.
The directors of Reed Elsevier NV have proposed anal dividend of 0.337 2011: 0.326.
The total cost of funding the proposed final dividends is expected to be 391m, for which no liability has been recognised at the statement of financial position date.

Impairment review Impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is performed at least annually based on cash generating units CGUs.
A CGU is the smallest identiable group of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets.
Goodwill impairment testing is performed on the basis of 22 CGUs.
CGUs which are not individually significant have been aggregated for presentation purposes.
Typically, when an acquisition is made the acquired business is fully integrated into the relevant business unit and CGU, and the goodwill arising is allocated to the CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

18 Financial instruments Details of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by Reed Elsevier in relation to financial instruments and capital management are set out on pages 56 and 57 of the Financial Review.
The main financial risks faced by Reed Elsevier are liquidity risk, market risk comprising interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk and credit risk.
Financial instruments are used to finance the Reed Elsevier businesses and to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Reed Elseviers businesses do not enter into speculative derivative transactions.
Details of financial instruments subject to liquidity, market and credit risks are described below.
Liquidity risk Reed Elsevier maintains a range of borrowing facilities and debt programmes to fund its requirements, at short notice and at competitive rates.
The remaining contractual maturities for borrowings and derivative financial instruments are shown in the table below.
The table shows undiscounted principal and interest cash ows and includes contractual gross cash ows to be exchanged aspart of cross currency interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts where there is a legal right of set-off.

At 31 December 2012, Reed Elsevier had access to a $2,000m committed bank facility maturing in June 2015, which was undrawn.
Thebank facility, together with certain private placements, are subject to financial covenants typical to Reed Elseviers size and nancialstrength.
Reed Elsevier was in compliance with these covenants for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Financial covenants arenot included in the terms and conditions of any outstanding public bonds.
After taking account of the maturity of committed bank facilities that back short term borrowings at 31 December 2012, and after utilising available cash resources, no borrowings mature within two years 2011: nil, 27% of borrowings mature in the third year 2011: 44%, 23% in the fourth and fifth years 2011: 18%, 39% in the sixth to tenth years 2011: 27%, and 11% beyond the tenth year 2011: 11%.
Market risk Reed Elseviers primary market risks are to interest rate uctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge orreduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
Derivatives used byReed Elsevier for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
The impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations and taxation is excluded from the following market risk sensitivity analysis.
Interest rate risk Reed Elseviers interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the combined businesses to changes ininterest rates.
At 31 December 2012, 59% of gross borrowings were either xed rate or had been xed through the use of interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and options.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in net finance costs of 8m 2011: 5m, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents, bank loans and commercial paper borrowings at 31 December 2012.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in net finance costs of 8m 2011: 5m.
The impact on net equity of a theoretical change in interest rates as at 31 December 2012 is restricted to the change in carrying value of oating rate to xed rate interest rate derivatives in a designated cash ow hedge relationship and undesignated interest rate derivatives.
A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated reduction in net equity of 1m 2011: 3m and a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would increase net equity by an estimated 2m 2011: 4m.
The impact of a change in interest rates on the carrying value of xed rate borrowings in a designated fair value hedge relationship would be offset by the change in carrying value of the related interest rate derivative.
Fixed rate borrowings not in a designated hedging relationship are carried at amortised cost.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2012 123 18 Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than sterling, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
These exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars see note 24.
A theoretical weakening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2012 would decrease the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 495m 2011: 525m.
This would be offset to a large degree by a decrease in net borrowings of 286m 2011: 297m.
A strengthening of all currencies by 10% against sterling at 31 December 2012 would increase the carrying value of net assets, excluding net borrowings, by 495m 2011: 525m and increase net borrowings by 286m 2011: 297m.
A retranslation of the combined businesses net profit for the year assuming a 10% weakening of all foreign currencies against sterling but excluding transactional exposures would reduce net profit by 80m 2011: 59m.
A 10% strengthening of all foreign currencies against sterling on this basis would increase net profit for the year by 80m 2011: 59m.
Credit risk Reed Elsevier seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
Reed Elsevier also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long term credit ratings, and the amounts outstanding with each of them.
Reed Elsevier has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA3 by Standard & Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
Reed Elsevier also has credit risk with respect to trade receivables due from its customers that include national and state governments, academic institutions and large and small enterprises including law rms, book stores and wholesalers.
The concentration of credit risk from trade receivables is limited due to the large and broad customer base.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the business units where they arise.
Where appropriate, business units seek to minimise this exposure by taking payment in advance and through management of credit terms.
Allowance is made for bad and doubtful debts based on managements assessment of the risk taking into account the ageing prole, experience and circumstance.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, recorded in the statement of financial position.
