2 Consolidated results Underlying EBIT In discussing the operating results of our business, we focus on a financial measure we refer to as Underlying EBIT.
Underlying EBIT is the key measure that management uses internally to assess the performance of our business, make decisions on the allocation of resources and assess operational management.
Management uses this measure because financing structures and tax regimes differ across our assets and substantial components of our tax and interest charges are levied at a Group rather than an operational level.
We exclude exceptional items from Underlying EBIT in order to enhance the comparability of the measure from period to period and provide clarity into the underlying performance of our operations.
Our management monitors exceptional items separately.
