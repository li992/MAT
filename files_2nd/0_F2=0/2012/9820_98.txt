PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS Details of the Groups principal subsidiary undertakings are provided in note 4 to the Company financial statements.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS On 9 August 2005 the Group entered into a Tax Deed of Covenant, which was amended on 22 November 2007, the primary objective of which was to ensure that the Group did not trigger a fide-grouping liability comprising Capital Gains Tax CGT and Stamp Duty Land Tax SDLT.
This would arise in the event of Marstons Pubs Limited being sold outside the Group, within six years of the relevant asset transfer date for CGT purposes, and within three years of the relevant asset transfer date for SDLT purposes.
Due to the passage of time and changes in the statutory rate of corporation tax, the total potential fide-grouping liability now stands at 49.0 million 2011: 49.8 million, of which 46.6 million 2011: 46.6 million relates to CGT and 2.4 million 2011: 3.2 million relates to SDLT.
In previous periods the Group received refunds totalling 5.9 million from HM Revenue & Customs HMRC.
This followed Tribunal Court of Appeal hearings involving The Rank Group Plc Rank, which concluded that there had been a breach of scal neutrality in the treatment of gaming machine income as liable to UK VAT.
The matter was referred to the European Court of Justice ECJ, which released its decision on 10 November 2011 conrming the key principles upon which Ranks case relied.
The case has now been remitted to the First-tier Tribunal FTT, to reconsider the evidence in line with the ECJs findings.
Following the FTT hearing and decision, the matter is likely to be appealed to at least one other UK Court.
HMRC issued protective assessments to recover the repayments pending the result of further Court hearings.
If HMRC are ultimately successful, the Group would be required to repay the 5.9 million plus interest.
The likelihood of such a repayment being required is not considered probable.
The Group has issued a letter of credit in favour of Royal Sun Alliance Insurance totalling 3.7 million 2011: 4.3 million and a letter of credit in favour of Aviva totalling 0.5 million 2011: nil to secure reinsurance contracts.
The letters of credit are secured on xed deposits for the same amount.
The Group has also entered into a Deed of Guarantee with the trustees of the Marstons PLC Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme whereby it guarantees to the Trustees the ongoing obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme, and the obligations of the Group to contribute to the Scheme in the event of a debt becoming due under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 on the occurrence of either a Group company entering liquidation or the Scheme winding up.
