Acquisitions On 18 July 2012, RPS acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Manidis Roberts Pty Ltd MR, an Australian consultancy firm.
The Group has allocated provisional fair values to the net assets of MR.
Details of the carrying values of the acquired net assets, the provisional fair values assigned to them by the Group and the fair value of consideration are as follows: 000s Manidis Roberts Intangible assets Order book 839 Customer relationships 2,993 Property, plant and equipment 862 Cash 2,155 Other assets 3,544 Other liabilities 3,377 Net assets acquired 7,016 Initial cash consideration 11,895 Fair value of deferred cash consideration 7,478 Total consideration 19,373 Goodwill 12,357 Goodwill arising of 12,357,000 represents the value of the accumulated workforce and synergies with RPS associated with this acquisition.
There is no tax deductible goodwill arising.
The total fair value of receivables acquired was 3,418,000.
The gross contractual receivables acquired were 3,469,000 and 51,000 was estimated to be irrecoverable.
The vendors of the acquired companies have entered into warranty arrangements with the Group.
The total undiscounted cash flow that could be receivable by the Group is between nil and 3,418,000.
The Group does not expect that these warranties will become receivable and therefore has not recognised an indemnification asset on acquisition.
The contribution of MR to the Groups results for the year was 6,027,000 revenue and 37,000 operating profit.
The Group incurred acquisition costs of 449,000 which have been expensed through the consolidated income statement and included within amortisation of acquired intangibles and transaction related expenses.
The proforma Group revenue and operating profit assuming the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the year would have been 564,716,000 and 43,188,000 respectively.
A reconciliation of the goodwill movement in 2012 in respect of the acquisitions in 2011 and 2012 is given in the table below.
