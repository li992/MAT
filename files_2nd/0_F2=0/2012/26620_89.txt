95 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 24.
Geographical disclosure Disclosure of revenue by geographic location is required by IFRS based on the registered domicile of the fund entity paying Man fees.
This geographic analysis is therefore not necessarily representative of the spread of our global business.
The geographic analysis of funds under management based on the location of the intermediary or institutional investor is given on page 2 and may be more relevant to an understanding of the geographic spread of our business.
In addition, the table below includes an analysis of revenue by geographic location of the legal entity recognising the revenue, as this is considered more meaningful than revenue by fund location.
