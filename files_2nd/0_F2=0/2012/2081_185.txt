The future realisation of this investment is intended to fund environmental obligations relating to the closure of the South African coal operations, and consequently this investment, while under the Groups control, is not available for the general purposes of the Group.
Any income from this investment is reinvested or applied to meet these obligations.
The Group retains responsibility for these environmental obligations until such time as the former mine sites have been rehabilitated in accordance with the relevant environmental legislation.
These obligations are therefore included under non-current provisions.
