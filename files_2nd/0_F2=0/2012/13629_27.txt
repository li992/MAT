Rotork plc Annual Report 2012 70 Overview 1-11 Business Review 12-39 Directors 40-43 Governance 44-64 Financial Statements 65-114 Company Information 115-117 Notes to the Group Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000.
Rotork plc is a company domiciled in England.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The accounting policies contained below in note 1 and the disclosures in notes 2 to 31 all relate to the Group financial statements.
The Company balance sheet can be found following note 31.
As the Company has elected to continue reporting under UK GAAP, the applicable accounting policies are contained in note a, and notes b tok relate to the Companys financial statements.
1. accountinG policieS The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Rotork plc have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC Interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention subject to the items referred to in the derivative financial instruments accounting policy below.
New accounting standards and interpretations The amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosures are applicable for the financial year ending 31 December 2012.
Application of this standard has not had any material impact on the disclosures, net assets or results of the Group.
Recent accounting developments The amendments to IAS19 Employee Benefits will be applied from 1 January 2013.
The principal change relates to the requirement to use the schemes discount rate to calculate the return on assets rather than using a rate of return appropriate to the various asset classes.
The application of the standard in 2012 would have reduced the pre-tax profit by 702,000 increasing the net pension interest cost to 1,092,000.
The impact on basic earnings per share would be a reduction of 0.6p to 102.5p.
In 2013, the net pension interest cost is estimated to be 1,150,000 under the amended standard.
The impact on shareholders equity will be negligible.
The following standards and interpretations were issued but are not yet effective and have not been adopted as application was not mandatory for the year and in some cases not yet endorsed for use in the EU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation amendments The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and amendments will not have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
In forming this view, the directors have considered trading and cash flow forecasts, financial commitments, the significant order book with customers spread across different geographic areas and industries and the significant net cash position.
consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year to 31 December 2012.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date control ceases.
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains or losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates at the dates the values were determined.
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to sterling at rates approximating those ruling at the date of the transactions.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries, and from the translation of the results of those subsidiaries at average rate, are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve.
Any differences that have arisen since 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are presented as a separate component of equity.
Translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS in respect of all foreign entities are not presented as a separate component.
Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods or services.
Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Groups activities.
Revenue from the sale of valve actuators, gearboxes and flow control products is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer in accordance with the contracted shipping terms.
Revenue from service work is recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated completion costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods.
business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition, including acquisition costs and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Rotork plc Annual Report 2012 72 Overview 1-11 Business Review 12-39 Directors 40-43 Governance 44-64 Financial Statements 65-114 Company Information 115-117 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2012 1. accountinG policieS CONTINUED In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units CGU.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
intangible assets i Research & development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of five years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired are as follows: Brands and trademarks 4 to 10 years Customer relationships 2 to 5 years Product design patents 5 to 8 years Order backlog 6 months to 1 year Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
property, plant and equipment Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over 50 years or the expected useful life of the building where less than 50 years.
Other assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.

Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
inventory and work in progress Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a first in, first out basis, and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cashflows.
equity Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
provisions i Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
ii Contingent consideration The terms of an acquisition may provide that the value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash at a future date, depends on uncertain future events.
Where it is not possible to estimate the amounts payable with any degree of certainty, the amounts recognised in the financial statements represent a fair value estimate at the balance sheet date of the amounts expected to be paid.
employee benefits i Pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plans, these are recognised in equity.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on scheme assets within financing income in the income statement.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Rotork plc Annual Report 2012 74 Overview 1-11 Business Review 12-39 Directors 40-43 Governance 44-64 Financial Statements 65-114 Company Information 115-117 Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2012 1. accountinG policieS CONTINUED ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork plc at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
Details of the scheme are given in note 25.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Long Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 25.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
iii Long term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee benefits In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of discretionary bonus schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share Scheme both of which are a known liability at the year end.
derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts and swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its Treasury Policy, the Group does not hold or issue contracts for trading purposes.
Forward exchange contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statementimmediately.
dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.

The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are listed below.
i Impairment of goodwill Determining whether Goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of CGUs to which Goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values.
Explanations of the estimates, judgements and sensitivities in respect of the current year impairment review are detailed in note 11. ii Valuation of acquired intangible assets Acquisitions may result in customer relationships, brands and trademarks, product design patents and order backlogs being recognised.
These are valued using discounted cash flows and relief from royalty methods.
In applying these methodologies certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows.
Details of the accounting policies are shown earlier in this note and the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets are shown in note 12. iii Defined benefit pension scheme liabilities Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases.
Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 24.

The intangible assets identified comprise customer relationships, brands, product design patents and acquired order books.

The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork plc controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.

Where the acquired entities growth into new markets is through the Groups existing sales network the lowest level of CGU is considered to be at the divisional level.
The carrying value of goodwill is allocated as follows: 2012 2011 Fluid Systems Rotork Fluid Systems 7,422 7,624 Rotork Sweden 6,837 6,786 Other cash generating units 8,611 8,610 22,870 23,020 instruments Fairchild 27,247 28,679 Soldo 14,196 41,443 28,679 controls Other cash generating units 8,707 8,967 8,707 8,967 Gears Other cash generating units 7,709 7,793 7,709 7,793 total Group 80,729 68,459 impairment testing Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
The Goodwill arising on the acquisition of Soldo has not been impairment tested due it being acquired in late 2012 and there being no indication of impairment.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs.
These calculations use cash flow projections on actual operating results and management forecasts.

Goodwill CONTINUED The key assumptions in the annual impairment review are set out below: i Management forecasts The three year plan is a bottom up process which takes place as part of the annual budget process.
The three year plan is prepared by each reporting entities management reflecting their view of the local market, known projects and experience of past performance.
The annual budget and the three year plan are approved by the Board each year.
ii Long term growth rates In the period after the three year plan growth rates are forecast at 2% per annum for each CGU 2011: 2%.
A rate of 2% is considered to be prudent considering the significant organic growth of the business over the last 10 years.
iii Discount rates Rotork divisions operate in all the same industry sectors and markets around the world.
Therefore discount rates for each of the CGUs are considered to be 10.4% 2011: 9.8% which represents a reasonable rate for a market participant in this sector.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts have significant headroom above the carrying value of each CGU with the exception of Fairchild.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable change in assumptions.
With the exception of Fairchild, there is no reasonable change that would cause the carrying values to exceed the recoverable amount.
With regard to Fairchild, which has only been part of the Group for 14 months downside sensitivities have been assessed.
An increase in the discount rate to 12.8% would result in the goodwill being impaired.
If the long term growth rate was 3%, the discount rate would need to increase to 13.6% for the goodwill to become impaired.
It is anticipated as Fairchild becomes more established within the Group and leverages the sales network opportunities the long term growth rate should comfortably exceed the 2.0% growth rate assumed in the base case forecast.

No scheme assets are invested in the Groups own equity.
The Group estimates that cash contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes during 2013 will be 3,476,000 for regular payments and additional payments of 1,700,000 in relation to past service 2012: 7,300,000.
The mortality assumptions used are the S1NXA year of birth tables with future improvements in mortality based on the CMI 2009 projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum 2011: 1.5%.
By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy: 2012 2011 life expectancy at age 65 Life Expectancy at age 65 current age male Female Male Female 65 22.5 24.8 22.4 24.7 45 24.8 27.2 24.7 27.1 ii other pension plans The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.

a Share option scheme At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees.
The allocation of options was linked to the completion of service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price at the date of grant.
Options vested after three years and expire 10 years after being granted.
No new grants have been made under the scheme since 2004.
Options over 6,480 shares were outstanding at the beginning of the year.
During 2012 all remaining options 2011: 5,332 were exercised and the Group received proceeds of 25,000 2011: 17,000 at a weighted average exercise price of 3.87 2011: 3.14.

ShaRe-baSed paymentS CONTINUED 2009 LTIP award No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of three year performance periods and the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share EPS is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
The performance period for the 2009 awards ended on 31 December 2011.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 30.0% vesting of this award as the Company was in the 50th percentile relative to the comparator group and the Groups EPS growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
2010 LTIP plan Following shareholder approval of the 2010 LTIP plan at the Companys AGM on 23 April 2010, awards of shares have been made annually to executive and senior managers.
Half of these awards vest under a TSR performance condition and half under an EPS performance condition.
The actual number of shares transferred will be determined by the number of shares initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI 10% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI 25%.
The performance period for the 2010 awards ended on 31 December 2012.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 75.5% vesting of these awards based on the performance criteria of the scheme.

Financial inStRumentS Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk, manages relations with the Groups bankers and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 80% to 90% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set around this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of nonpayment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group maintains an allowance for impairment in respect of noninsured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing and liquidity of funds.

Financial inStRumentS CONTINUED b liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2011: 7m on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 1.5%.
In January 2013 the Group arranged a 15m committed loan facility with a tenor of one year.
Interest is payable on this committed facility at LIBOR plus 1%.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: analysis of contractual cash flow maturities carrying contractual less than more than 31 december 2012 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 92 92 30 30 32 Finance lease liabilities 40 42 28 11 3 Trade and other payables 71,567 71,567 71,567 Foreign exchange contracts 96 96 96 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 71,835 71,837 71,721 41 35 40 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2011 amount cash flows 12 months 12 years 25 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 198 198 69 35 94 Finance lease liabilities 114 122 62 36 24 Trade and other payables 77,102 77,102 77,102 Forward exchange contracts 614 614 596 18 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 78,068 78,076 77,829 89 118 40 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 134,353,000 2011: 116,580,000 and the gross inflow is 136,625,000 2011: 117,216,000.

Financial inStRumentS CONTINUED c market risk Market risk arises from changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, and may affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business units functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other nonsterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures may also be hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Groups cash management some of the overseas subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intragroup counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary so the UK holds a foreign currency current asset or liability which is usually hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the forward part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2012 was a 2,158,000 asset 2011: 378,000 asset comprising an asset of 2,254,000 2011: 992,000 and a liability of 96,000 2011: 614,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2012 mature in 2013 and 2014.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of either the US dollar or euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 of 350,000 2011: 350,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: average rate closing rate 2012 2011 2012 2011 US dollar 1.59 1.59 1.62 1.55 Euro 1.23 1.15 1.23 1.20 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling, US dollar, euro and renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.

i Designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, and gains and losses are taken to equity.
ii Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
iii Contingent consideration As all the contingent consideration is contractually due for payment within 15 months, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
