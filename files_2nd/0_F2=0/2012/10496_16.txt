indd 97 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Directors responsibility statement The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report, directors remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
South African and UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under the Companies Act of South Africa 2008, the directors are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for each financial year giving a true and fair view of the Mondi Limited parent companys and the Groups state of affairs at the end of the year and profit and loss for the year.
Under the UK Companies Act 2006, the directors are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the Mondi plc parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law.
Furthermore, under UK company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit and loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the Groups financial statements and the Mondi Limited parent company financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, requires that the directors: properly select and consistently apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance: and make an assessment of the Groups and companys ability to continue as a going concern.
In preparing the Mondi plc parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Groups and companys transactions: disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Group and company: and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
Report on the financial statements These financial statements have been prepared under the supervision of the Group chief financial officer, Andrew King CA SA, as required by Section 29 1 e ii of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008, and have been audited in compliance with the applicable requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa 2008 and the UK Companies Act 2006.
The Boards confirm that to the best of their knowledge: the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of Mondi Limited, Mondi plc and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and the management report, which is incorporated into the directors report, includes a fair view of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements, and related notes 1 to 41, were approved by the Boards and authorised for issue on 20 February 2013 and were signed on its behalf by: David Hathorn Andrew King Director Director 20 February 2013 20 February 2013 98 Integrated report and financial statements 2012 6313 12 Mondi IR Fins Final 2March13.

Directors responsibility for the financial statements The Groups directors are responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditors responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing.
Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
The procedures selected depend on the auditors judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the combined and consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
In making these assessments, the auditors consider internal control relevant to the Groups preparation and presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control.
An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Mondi Group as at 31 December 2012, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and the requirements of the Companies Act of South Africa.
Other reports required by the Companies Act As part of our audit of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012, we have read the directors report, the audit committees report and the company secretarys certificate for the purpose of identifying whether there are material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited financial statements.
These reports are the responsibility of the respective preparers.
Based on reading these reports we have not identified material inconsistencies between these reports and the audited financial statements.
However, we have not audited these reports and accordingly do not express an opinion on these reports.

Scope of the audit of the financial statements An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Groups circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed: the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors: and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements.
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

indd 106 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Groups combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
There are no differences for the Group in applying IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group also complies with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Group has also complied with the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Financial Reporting Guides as issued by the Accounting Practices Committee and Financial Reporting Pronouncements as issued by the Reporting Standards Council of South Africa.
The combined and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in the chief financial officers report, under the heading Going concern.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation Dual listed structure The Group has two separate legal parent entities, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, which operate under a dual listed company DLC structure.
The substance of the DLC structure is such that Mondi Limited and its subsidiaries, and Mondi plc and its subsidiaries, operate together as a single economic entity through a sharing agreement, with neither parent entity assuming a dominant role.
Accordingly, Mondi Limited and Mondi plc are reported on a combined and consolidated basis as a single reporting entity.
Subsidiaries The combined and consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, and of their respective subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Subsidiaries are those entities over which the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern operating and financial policy in order to obtain economic benefits.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the years presented are included in the combined and consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquiring control or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into alignment with those used by the Group.
The interest of non-controlling interests is measured, at initial recognition, as the non-controlling proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised at acquisition, except for those instances where the Group elects to measure the non-controlling interests at fair value.
After initial recognition non-controlling interests are measured as the aggregate of the value at initial recognition and their subsequent proportionate share of profits and losses.
Changes in the Groups interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change in control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Any resulting difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests is adjusted for and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the equity holders of the parent companies.
Joint ventures A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds a long-term interest with a contractually agreed sharing of control over the strategic, financial and operating decisions with one or more other venturers.
The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by applying proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the joint ventures individual income, expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements.
The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the Group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Groups purchase of assets from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party.
However, a loss on the transaction is recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets, or an impairment loss.

indd 107 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Associates Associates are investments over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Typically, the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity of its associates.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
The Groups share of associates net income, presented net of tax, is based on financial statements drawn up to reporting dates that are either coterminous with that of the Group or no more than three months prior to that date.
Where reporting dates are not coterminous, adjustments are made to the associates net income for the effects of significant transactions or events that occur after the associates reporting date up to the reporting date of the Group.
The total carrying values of investments in associates represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of goodwill, the share of post-acquisition retained earnings, any other movements in reserves and any long-term debt interests which in substance form part of the Groups net investment in that entity.
The carrying values of associates are reviewed on a regular basis and if an impairment has occurred, it is written off in the year in which those circumstances arose.
The Groups share of an associates losses in excess of its interest in that associate is not recognised unless the Group has an obligation to fund such losses.
Revenue recognition Sale of goods Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes.
A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
This is when title and insurance risk has passed to the customer, and the goods have been delivered to a contractually agreed location.
Sale of green energy and CO e credits 2 Revenue generated from the sale of green energy and CO e credits issued under international schemes are recorded as income 2 within other net operating expenses in the combined and consolidated income statement when ownership rights pass to the buyer.
Investment income Interest income, which is derived from cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale investments, and loans and receivables, is accrued on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effective interest rate.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment has been established.
Business combinations Identifiable net assets At the date of acquisition the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, a joint venture or an associate are recorded at their fair values on acquisition date.
Assets and liabilities which cannot be measured reliably are recorded at provisional fair values, which are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Cost of a business combination The cost of a business combination includes the fair value of assets provided, liabilities incurred or assumed, and any equity instruments issued by a Group entity, in exchange for control of an acquiree.
The directly attributable costs associated with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Goodwill Any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is attributed to goodwill.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint ventures is included within intangible assets.
Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of associates.
Where the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired exceed the cost of the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the acquisition bargain purchase, is credited to the combined and consolidated income statement in the year of acquisition.

indd 108 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 1 Accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Boards for internal management purposes.
The recoverable amount of the group of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually on a consistent date during each financial year, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Impairments of goodwill are not subsequently reversed.
Non-current non-financial assets excluding goodwill, deferred tax and retirement benefits surplus Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprise land and buildings, plant and equipment and assets in the course of construction.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost includes all costs incurred in bringing the assets to the location and condition for their intended use and includes borrowing costs incurred to the extent that the asset is a qualifying asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land and assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values at varying rates, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives range from three years to 20 years for items of plant and equipment and to a maximum of 50 years for buildings.
Licences, other intangibles and research and development expenditure Licences and other intangibles are measured initially at purchase consideration and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Estimated useful lives vary between three years and 10 years and are reviewed at least annually.
Research expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Development costs are reviewed annually and are recognised as an expense if they do not qualify for capitalisation.
Development costs are capitalised when the completion of the asset is both commercially and technically feasible and are amortised on a systematic basis over the economic life of the related development.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows generated by the asset are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset, or cash-generating unit, is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised as an expense in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Where the underlying circumstances change such that a previously recognised impairment subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset, or cash-generating unit, is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount.
Such reversal is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment been recognised for the asset, or cash-generating unit, in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.

indd 109 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Agriculture Owned forestry assets Owned forestry assets are measured at fair value, calculated by applying the expected selling price, less costs to harvest and deliver, to the estimated volume of timber on hand at each reporting date.
The estimated volume of timber on hand is determined based on the maturity profile of the area under afforestation, the species, the geographic location and other environmental considerations and excludes future growth.
The product of these is then adjusted to present value by applying a market related pre tax discount rate.
Changes in fair value are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within other net operating expenses.
At point of felling, the carrying value of forestry assets is transferred to inventory.
Directly attributable costs incurred during the year of biological growth and investments in standing timber are capitalised and presented within cash flows from investing activities in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows.
Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets, and disposal groups, are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets, and disposal groups, classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell from the date on which these conditions are met.
Any resulting impairment is reported through the combined and consolidated income statement as a special item.
On classification as held for sale, the assets are no longer depreciated or amortised.
Comparative amounts are not adjusted.
Discontinued operations are either a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that have been disposed of or are part of a single co-ordinated plan for disposal, or represent a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Once an operation has been identified as discontinued, its net profit or loss is presented separately in the combined and consolidated income statement and related notes and comparative information is restated.
Information presented in the combined and consolidated statements of financial position and cash flows, including related notes to these statements, is not separated between continuing and discontinued operations.
Current non-financial assets Inventory Inventory and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the first-in-first-out FIFO or weighted average cost basis, as appropriate.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value is defined as the selling price less any estimated costs to sell.
Retirement benefits The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for its employees as well as post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the combined and consolidated income statement is the contributions paid or payable during the reporting period.
Defined benefit and post-retirement medical plans For defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, actuarial valuations are performed at each financial year end.
The average discount rate for the plans liabilities is based on AA rated corporate bonds or similar government bonds of a suitable duration and currency.
Pension plans assets are measured using year end market values.
Actuarial gains and losses, which arise from differences between expected and actual outcomes or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive income, net of deferred tax, and accumulated in equity.
Any increase in the present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during the year is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on plan assets and the expected increase during the year in the present value of plan liabilities are included in investment income and interest expense respectively.

indd 110 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 1 Accounting policies continued Past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested or amortised on a straight-line basis over the period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset retirement benefits surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to past service costs, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the relevant Group scheme.
Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax charge and the movement in deferred tax.
Current tax The current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The Group paid Secondary Tax on Companies STC until 31 March 2012 on dividends declared by South African entities net of dividends received, based on the applicable STC rate.
The STC regime was replaced with a new Dividend Tax DT regime, effective 1 April 2012, which constitutes a withholding tax imposed at a shareholder level but payable by the Group on behalf of the shareholder.
DT is imposed in respect of any dividend approved by a South African company on or after 1 April 2012, and is levied at a rate of 15%.
This rate may be reduced under the provisions of certain Double Tax Agreements.
In addition, the DT legislation includes a number of exemptions, including an exemption for dividends paid to certain exempt entities.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition, other than in a business combination, of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date.
The carrying amount is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Similarly, it is increased to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the future for all or part of the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the combined and consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also taken directly to other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

indd 111 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the combined and consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more representative of the pattern of use.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at inception of the lease at the lower of fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments derived by discounting using the interest rate implicit in the lease.
The interest element of the rental is recognised as a finance charge in the combined and consolidated income statement, unless it is directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case it is capitalised in accordance with the Groups policy on borrowing costs.
These assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful economic lives of the assets.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, which it will be required to settle.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restoration and environmental costs An obligation to incur restoration and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the ongoing production of a plant or landfill site.
Costs for restoration of site damage are provided for at their present values and charged against profit and loss as the obligation arises.
Government grants Government grants are recognised when the right to receive such grants is established and are treated as deferred income.
They are released to the combined and consolidated income statement on a systematic basis, either over the expected useful lives of the assets for which they are provided, or over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate.
Foreign currency transactions and translation Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded in their functional currencies at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions.
At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Gains and losses arising on translation are included in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified as either operating or financing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
Translation of overseas operations The Groups results are presented in euro, the currency in which most of its business is conducted.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates prevailing on the reporting date.
Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year where these approximate the rates on the dates of the underlying transactions.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are reclassified to profit and loss only on disposal or partial disposal of the overseas operation.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation schemes.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised concurrently as an expense and an adjustment to equity.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards granted, as adjusted for market performance conditions and non-vesting conditions where applicable.
Vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share awards that are expected to vest as a result of changes in non-market vesting conditions.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined and consolidated income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.

indd 112 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups combined and consolidated statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial asset investments Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are either classified as available-for-sale or loans and receivables.
Available-for-sale investments are initially recorded at fair value.
They are subsequently remeasured at each reporting date to fair value.
Any unrealised gains and losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and deferred in equity until an investment is disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term, highly liquid investments of a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts are shown within short-term borrowings in current liabilities in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash and cash equivalents in the combined and consolidated statement of cash flows and in the presentation of net debt are reflected net of overdrafts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less allowance for any impairment as appropriate.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowings Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value, net of direct transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Net debt Net debt is a non-IFRS measure and consists of short-, mediumand long-term borrowings and bank overdrafts less cash and cash equivalents and current financial asset investments.
Borrowing costs Interest on borrowings directly relating to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets is capitalised until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Where funds have been borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the construction period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group enters into forward, option and swap contracts in order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently held at fair value in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position within derivative financial instruments, and are classified as current or non-current depending on the maturity of the derivative.

indd 113 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies continued Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not formally designated in hedge relationships are recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement and are classified within operating profit or net finance costs, depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.
Embedded derivatives that are not designated as hedges and are required to be separately measured from the host contracts are initially recognised in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value and remeasured at each reporting date.
Subsequent fair value changes are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement within net finance costs.
Where appropriate, the embedded derivative and its host contract are presented on a net basis in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, amounts deferred in the Groups cash flow hedge reserve in equity are recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects profit and loss on a proportionate basis.
Fair value hedges For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged with the corresponding entry in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Gains or losses from remeasuring the associated derivative are also recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Ineffective, expired, sold, terminated or exercised hedging instruments Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge relationship is revoked or the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity remains in equity and is recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is included immediately in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Equity instruments, share issue costs, treasury shares and dividend payments Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown as a deduction, net of applicable tax, from the proceeds.
An incremental share issue cost is one which would not have arisen if shares had not been issued.
Treasury shares The purchase by any Group entity of either Mondi Limiteds or Mondi plcs equity instruments results in the recognition of treasury shares.
The consideration paid is deducted from equity.
Where treasury shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to the equity holders of either Mondi Limited or Mondi plc, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects.
Dividend payments Dividend distributions to Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by both Mondi Limiteds and Mondi plcs ordinary equity holders at their respective annual general meetings and interim dividends are recognised when approved by the Boards.

indd 114 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 1 Accounting policies continued Special items Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed to assist in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group and its businesses.
Such items are material by nature or amount in relation to the financial years results.
Earnings per share EPS Basic EPS Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent companies by the weighted average number of the sum of ordinary Mondi Limited and Mondi plc shares in issue during the year, net of treasury shares.
For this purpose, net profit is defined as the profit after tax and special items attributable to equity holders of the parent companies.
Diluted EPS For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of the sum of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc ordinary shares in issue, net of treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share awards granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease EPS.
The effect of anti-dilutive potential shares is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.
Underlying and headline EPS Underlying EPS excludes the impact of special items and is a non-IFRS measure.
It is included to provide an additional basis on which to measure the Groups earnings performance.
The presentation of headline EPS is mandated under the JSE Listings Requirements and is calculated in accordance with Circular 3 2012, Headline Earnings, as issued by the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants.
Segmental reporting The Groups operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the DLC executive committee, the chief operating decision-making body.
New accounting policies, early adoption and future requirements Standards and Interpretations early adopted by the Group There were no Standards or Interpretations early adopted by the Group in the current year.

The impact of these Standards will be that the Mondi Shanduka Newsprint joint venture will be consolidated with effect from 1 January 2013, with prior periods restated.
IFRS 12 prescribes additional disclosures about the Groups significant investments and will not impact the Groups financial results.
IFRS 13 requires that, in instances where fair value is prescribed by another Standard, the principles of this Standard be applied to that fair value measurement.
The Group does not expect IFRS 13 to have a significant impact on its fair value measurements.
IAS 19 revised will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Groups total obligation.
It is likely that, following the replacement of expected returns on plan assets with a net finance cost in the combined and consolidated income statement, the profit for the period will be reduced and accordingly other comprehensive income increased.
The following amendments to published Standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups results, and will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IFRS 2 Share-based payments IFRS 8 Operating Segments IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows IAS 12 Income Taxes IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation IAS 36 Impairment of Assets IAS 38 Intangible Assets The following amendments to published Standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups results, and will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015: IFRS 3 Business Combinations The Group is in the process of assessing the impact of the following Standards and amendments to published Standards on the Groups results, which will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Accounting estimates and critical judgements The preparation of the Groups combined and consolidated financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect certain items reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and the combined and consolidated income statement.
The disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities is also affected by the use of estimation techniques.
Although the estimates used are based on managements best information about current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of certain assets and liabilities within the next financial year are disclosed below.

indd 116 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 1 Accounting policies continued Estimated residual values and useful economic lives The carrying values of certain tangible fixed assets are sensitive to assumptions relating to projected residual values and useful economic lives, which determine the depreciable amount and the rate at which capital expenditure is depreciated.
The Group reassesses these assumptions at least annually or more often if there are indications that they require revision.
Estimated residual values are based on available secondary market prices as at the reporting date unless estimated to be zero.
Useful economic lives are based on the expected usage, wear and tear, technical or commercial obsolescence and legal limits on the usage of capital assets.
Acquisition date fair values of identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations The acquisition date fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations were determined using conventional best practice valuation techniques with independent qualified valuators utilised where appropriate.
The acquisition date fair values of these intangible assets are sensitive to certain key valuation assumptions including, but not limited to, the projected net cash flows of the assets, the assumed discount rates and the related underlying risks of realising the assets intrinsic economic value.
The carrying values of these intangible assets see note 29 are therefore provisional in nature and subject to evaluation post acquisition.
Any resulting adjustments will, if necessary, be made within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Estimated impairment of goodwill, tangible and intangible assets For the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group incurred net asset impairment costs of E5 million 2011: E49 million see note 14 and goodwill impairment costs of Enil 2011: Enil see note 13.
The Group assesses annually whether goodwill, tangible and intangible assets have suffered any impairment, in accordance with the stated Group accounting policy.
The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units, intangible assets and tangible fixed assets are determined based on value-in-use calculations, which require the exercise of managements judgement across a limited range of input assumptions and estimates.
The principal assumptions used relate to the time value of money and expected future cash flows.
The Group assesses annually whether there are any indications that items of property, plant and equipment, including assets in the course of construction, and intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
Indications of impairment are inherently judgemental and require management to assess both internal and external sources of information.
Fair value of owned forestry assets For the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group recorded a fair value adjustment of E40 million 2011: E49 million.
Forestry assets as at 31 December 2012 totalled E311 million 2011: E297 million see note 15.
The Group determines the fair value based on the present value of expected net cash flows arising from its owned forestry assets, discounted at a current, market determined pre tax rate.
Managements judgement is exercised in determining the future net cash flows and the discount rate.
Future net cash flows are dependent upon inputs including expected selling prices: costs of transport, harvesting, extraction and loading THEL : and the factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to tonnes of standing timber which in itself is dependent on a variety of environmental factors.
Net selling price is selling price after deduction of THEL costs.
The reported value of owned forestry assets would change as follows should there be a change in these underlying sensitivities: E million 2012 Effect of E1 increase in net selling price 14 Effect of 1% increase in conversion factor hectares to tonnes 3 Effect of 1% increase in discount rate 3 Mondi Group 117 6313 12 Mondi IR Fins Final 2March13.

The Groups scheme liabilities are sensitive to changes in various underlying actuarial assumptions set by management.
These assumptions include the discount and inflation rates to apply to scheme liabilities, the mortality rates to apply to scheme members, the long-term medical cost trend rates to apply to medical schemes and the rates of increase of future salaries.
Further details regarding the assumptions are set out in note 25.
2 Operating segments Identification of the Groups externally reportable operating segments The Groups externally reportable segments reflect the internal reporting structure of the Group, which is the basis on which resource allocation decisions are made by management in the pursuit of strategic objectives.
The Group operates under two primary geographic regions reflecting its South African activities and assets, and its international, principally European, activities and assets.
The broad European region is further split by product segments reflecting the management structure of the Group.
Following the completion of the acquisition of Nordenia International AG Nordenia on 1 October 2012 refer note 29 the Europe & International business was reorganised to comprise four operating segments: Packaging Paper, Fibre Packaging, Consumer Packaging and Uncoated Fine Paper.
Furthermore, the disposal of Aylesford Newsprint on 2 October 2012 refer note 31 resulted in the previously reported Newsprint segment no longer meeting any of the quantitative thresholds required for classification as a separate operating segment.
The remaining newsprint joint venture, Mondi Shanduka Newsprint, has accordingly been incorporated into the South Africa Division due to similarities in geographical location, production processes and the integrated nature of the production facilities.
The Groups segmental information for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been restated to reflect these reorganisations.

indd 130 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 9 Discontinued operation On 30 June 2011, the Mondi Group shareholders approved a special resolution to separate the Groups interest in Mondi Packaging South Africa MPSA via a demerger in terms of which all the ordinary shares in MPSA held by Mondi Limited were distributed to the Mondi Limited ordinary shareholders by way of a dividend in specie.
MPSA was listed on 11 July 2011 under a new name, Mpact Limited Mpact, on the securities exchange operated by the JSE Limited JSE.
Subsequent to the demerger, a consolidation of the Mondi Limited ordinary shares owned by Mondi Limited shareholders, the effect of which was to reduce their proportionate interest in the Mondi Group, was undertaken in order to compensate Mondi plc shareholders for the value distributed to Mondi Limited shareholders in terms of the demerger.
The result of the Mondi Limited share consolidation was that the number of Mondi Limited shares in issue reduced from 147 million to 118 million and the total number of Mondi shares in issue reduced from 514 million to 486 million.
Prior to the demerger, Mpact paid interest of E13 million for the year ended 31 December 2011 to Mondi Limited in respect of intercompany financing provided, which eliminated on consolidation and thus was not taken into consideration in the tables below.

indd 133 2013 03 04 3:20 PM Notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 11 Alternative measure of earnings per share The directors elected to present an alternative, non-IFRS measure of earnings per share from continuing operations in order to provide shareholders with a comparison of the continuing operations of the Group as if the demerger of Mpact and related share consolidation had occurred on 1 January 2011.
This is deemed appropriate as it is the continuing operations of the Group, after taking the impact of the share consolidation into consideration, which form the basis of the performance of the Group.
This approach enables a useful comparison of earnings per share from continuing operations, based on the consolidated shares, for all future periods.
The presentation of such an alternative, non-IFRS measure of earnings per share is classified by the JSE Limited as pro-forma financial information.
Refer to the Mondi Group Integrated report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 for the pro-forma financial information and independent reporting accountants report thereon.
In addition, the effect of the recapitalisation of Mpact resulted in a repayment of intercompany debt by Mpact to Mondi Limited on 4 and 5 July 2011 of E76 million.
These proceeds were used to reduce the Groups net debt.
The alternative measure of earnings per share has therefore been adjusted to take the related saving on interest paid into consideration as if the recapitalisation had occurred on 1 January 2011.
The demerger and related share consolidation had no impact on the Groups results for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Earnings E million 2012 2011 Underlying earnings for the financial year 336 340 1 Tax saving by Mondi Limited on intercompany interest received from Mpact 4 Saving of interest paid on net debt at 8.6% per annum 3 Tax at 28% on saving of interest paid 1 Adjusted earnings for the financial year 336 346 Note: 1 Had the r ecapitalisation of Mpact occurred on 1 January 2011, Mondi Limited would no longer have received interest on its intercompany loans to Mpact and thus the tax charge on the interest received would not have been incurred.
The revised weighted average number of shares is determined as follows: Number of shares million 2012 2011 Basic number of ordinary shares outstanding 483 499 1 Adjustment for Mondi Limited share consolidation 17 2 Adjusted basic number of ordinary shares outstanding 483 482 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares 2 6 Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding after Mondi Limited share consolidation 485 488 Notes: 1 The actual number of shar es subject to consolidation was 29 million.
The adjustment reflects the impact on the number of shares as if the share consolidation had occurred with effect from 1 January 2011 and takes treasury shares into consideration.
In 2011, the adjustment reflects the period up to the date of the share consolidation as the share consolidation is included in the basic number of ordinary shares outstanding from 1 August 2011.
2 The basic number of or dinary shares outstanding represents the weighted average number in issue for Mondi Limited and Mondi plc for the year, as adjusted for the weighted average number of treasury shares held during the year.

The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
Value-in-use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets covering a three year period that are based on the latest forecasts for revenue and cost as approved by the Boards and reflecting latest industry forecasts and managements expectations based on past experience.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts and assume a growth rate not exceeding gross domestic product for the respective countries.
Zero percent growth rates are assumed in perpetuity for most of the businesses given the commodity nature of the majority of the products i. e. volume growth is assumed to be offset by real price declines.
Following the acquisition of Nordenia in 2012, growth of 3% was assumed for Consumer Packaging given the nature of the business and its expected growth rates.
Post tax cash flow projections are discounted using a post tax discount rate of 7.37% 2011: 7.73%, adjusted by 0% 3% reflecting the economic and political risks of the specific location that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows specific to each CGU.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could change materially over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors, including market and production estimates, together with economic factors such as prices, discount rates, currency exchange rates, estimates of production costs and future capital expenditure.
Sensitivity analyses of a 1% increase decrease in weighted average cost of capital, a 1% increase decrease in the growth rate applied to expected future cash flows, or a 5% increase decrease in cash flows were performed and these did not give rise to an impairment.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Appropriate valuation methodologies are employed to measure the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The notional amounts presented represent the aggregate face value of all foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and commodity price derivatives outstanding at the reporting date.
They do not indicate the contractual future cash flows of the derivative instruments held or their current fair value and therefore do not indicate the Groups exposure to credit or market risks.
Note 38 provides an overview of the Groups management of financial risks through the selective use of derivative financial instruments and also includes a presentation of the undiscounted future contractual cash flows of the derivative contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
Included in the fair value of the E280 million Eurobond is an embedded derivative call option which is separately measured at fair value at each reporting date.
For presentation purposes the bond and the call option asset are presented on a net basis in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position refer note 21.
Hedging Cash flow hedges The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges.
The fair value gains losses are reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit and loss in the period when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
For non-current non-financial assets, these gains losses are included in the carrying value of the asset and depreciated over the same useful life as the cost of the asset.

A further E1,349 million 2011: E1,262 million of losses have no expiry date.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on gross temporary differences of E719 million 2011: E640 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A change to UK tax legislation largely exempts, from UK tax, overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009.
As a result, the gross temporary differences at 31 December 2012 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings would still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
25 Retirement benefits The Group operates post-retirement defined contribution and defined benefit plans for the majority of its employees.
It also operates two post-retirement medical plans.
Defined contribution plans The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge, from continuing and discontinued operations, in respect of these plans of E11 million 2011: E14 million is calculated on the basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year.
There were no material outstanding or prepaid contributions recognised in relation to these plans as at the reporting dates presented.
Defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans Only a few of the post-retirement defined benefit plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The majority of the post-retirement defined benefit plans are unfunded pension and severance plans, principally in Europe.
In November 2011 the trustees of the defined benefit pension plan in South Africa, with agreement from the participating pensioners and employees, resolved to wind up the fund subject to regulatory approval.
Regulatory approval was received in January 2012 and accordingly, Mondi Limited recognised a settlement charge of E2 million in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The fund has subsequently entered the liquidation process and Mondi Limited expects to receive a reimbursement of the pension surplus of E6 million once the fund is wound up, subject to any potential claims.
The expected reimbursement is included in trade and other receivables.
The post-retirement medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain of their dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The South African plan is unfunded whilst the Austrian plan is funded.
The South African plan has been closed to new participants since 1 January 1999.

Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations every three years using the projected unit credit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2012.
The market value of assets is used to determine the funding level of the plans and is sufficient to cover 72% 2011: 105% of the benefits which have accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions at rates agreed with the schemes trustees and in accordance with local actuarial advice and statutory provisions.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members.
Consequently, it is expected that the Groups share of contributions will increase as the schemes members age.
The expected contributions to be paid to defined benefit pension plans and post-retirement medical plans during 2013 are E15 million 2012: E16 million.
The aggregate benefit obligation in respect of the unfunded plans as at 31 December 2012 is E208 million 2011: E183 million.
The total loss before tax, recognised in equity relating to experience movements on scheme liabilities and plan assets and actuarial assumption changes, excluding surplus restriction movements, for the year ended 31 December 2012 is E61 million 2011: loss before tax of E18 million.
The cumulative total recognised since 1 January 2004 is a loss of E90 million.

The acquisition enables the Group to create a leading consumer packaging business.
Nordenia generated operating profits prior to its acquisition by Mondi, but was highly geared and as a result had an equity deficit.
The premium of E268 million paid over the fair values of Nordenias identifiable net assets was recognised as goodwill on acquisition and can be attributed to significant synergies to be realised from combining Nordenias existing consumer packaging activities with those of Mondi, the ability to leverage Nordenias existing competencies in high-growth emerging markets, exposure to Nordenias proven innovation and product development processes and access to Nordenias long-term relationships with a broad blue chip customer base.
It is not expected that any portion of the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.
The interest of non-controlling interests in Nordenia of 0.07% recognised at the acquisition date was insignificant.
The fair value accounting reflected in these results is provisional in nature.
The nature of this business is such that adjustments to the carrying values of acquired assets and or liabilities, and to the goodwill arising on acquisition, are possible as the detail of the acquired business is evaluated post acquisition.
If necessary, these adjustments will be made within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Prior to being acquired by Mondi, Nordenia generated revenue of approximately E74 million per month and underlying operating profit of E6 million per month.
Nordenias revenue for the year ended 31 December 2012 was E873 million with a profit after tax of E1 million.
Nordenias revenue of E208 million and underlying operating profit of E1 million since date of acquisition have been included in the combined and consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs of E11 million related to the acquisition are recognised as a special item in the combined and consolidated income statement.

Other acquisitions On 2 May 2012, following completion of a number of suspensive conditions, including a ruling from the Arbitration Court of the National Chamber of Commerce in Poland, Mondi Swiecie S. A. acquired the entire share capital of Saturn Management Sp.
Z o. o. from Polish Energy Partners S. A. for a net cash consideration of E31 million and the assumption of debt of E57 million.
The premium of E4 million paid over the acquisition date fair values of the net assets acquired is attributable to expected cost saving synergies.
Transaction costs of approximately E1 million were expensed.
Saturn Energy is the owner of the power and heat generating plant that provides Mondi Swiecie S. A. with most of its electricity requirements and all of its heat and steam needs.
In line with Mondis existing strategy to strengthen its leading market position in corrugated packaging in central and eastern Europe, Mondi acquired two corrugated box plants in Germany and the Czech Republic, consuming 130,000 tonnes of containerboard per annum, and a 105,000 tonne recycled containerboard mill in the Czech Republic from Duropack GmbH Duropack for a cash consideration of E133 million on 5 November 2012.
On 19 November 2012 the Group announced its intention to close the recycled containerboard mill.
Closure costs of E3 million were recognised in the combined and consolidated income statement.
The premium of the purchase price over the acquisition date fair values of the net assets acquired from Duropack amounted to E84 million and is mainly attributable to synergies expected to be realised from combining the converting activities of the two box plants with the Groups existing operations.
It is not expected that any portion of the goodwill arising from the acquisition of these businesses will be deductible for tax purposes.

The exchange control conditions do not infringe upon the Groups ability to optimally manage its capital structure.
However, they do require that the capital supplied by, or made available to, the shareholders of Mondi Limited and Mondi plc, is constrained by the equality of treatment mechanism, which serves to maintain and protect the economic interests of both sets of shareholders.
The Group has continually met the exchange control provisions in the past and management is committed to ensuring that the Group continues to meet these provisions in future.
The Groups trading and financing activities expose it to various financial risks that, if left unmanaged, could adversely impact on current or future earnings.
Although not necessarily mutually exclusive, these financial risks are categorised separately according to their different generic risk characteristics and include market risk foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Boards and are overseen by the DLC executive committee.
In turn, the DLC executive committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group treasury continually reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks by entering into derivative contracts with counterparties where appropriate.
The Group does not take speculative positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
38 Financial risk management Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Both risks are actively monitored on a continuous basis and managed through the use of foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps respectively.
Although the Groups cash flows are exposed to movements in key input and output prices, such movements represent economic rather than residual financial risk inherent to the Group.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates across various national boundaries and is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the normal course of its business.
Multiple currency exposures arise from forecast commercial transactions denominated in foreign currencies, recognised financial assets and liabilities monetary items denominated in foreign currencies and translational exposure on net investments in foreign operations.
Foreign exchange contracts The Groups foreign exchange policy requires its subsidiaries to actively manage foreign currency exposures against their functional currencies by entering into foreign exchange contracts.
For segmental reporting purposes, each subsidiary enters into, and accounts for, foreign exchange contracts with Group treasury or with counterparties that are external to the Group, whichever is more commercially appropriate.
Only material balance sheet exposures and highly probable forecast capital expenditure transactions are hedged.
Currencies bought or sold forward to mitigate possible unfavourable movements on recognised monetary items are marked to market at each reporting date.
Foreign currency monetary items are translated at each reporting date to incorporate the underlying foreign exchange movements and any such movements naturally offset fair value movements on related forward foreign exchange contracts.

The sensitivity analysis provides an indication of the impact on the Groups reported earnings of reasonably possible changes in the currency exposures embedded within the functional currency environments that the Group operates in.
In addition, an indication is provided of how reasonably possible changes in foreign exchange rates might impact on the Groups equity, as a result of fair value adjustments to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
Reasonably possible changes are based on an analysis of historic currency volatility, together with any relevant assumptions regarding near-term future volatility.

It has been assumed that changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges of non-monetary assets and liabilities are fully recorded in equity and that all other variables are held constant.
Interest rate risk The Group holds cash and cash equivalents, which earn interest at a variable rate and has variable and fixed rate debt in issue.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Although the Group has fixed rate debt in issue, the Groups accounting policy stipulates that all borrowings are held at amortised cost.
As a result, the carrying value of fixed rate debt is not sensitive to changes in credit conditions in the relevant debt markets and there is therefore no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with short-term highly liquid investments which have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition.
Centralised cash pooling arrangements are in place, which ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and, in addition, to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
Management of variable rate debt The Group has multiple variable rate debt facilities, of which the most significant is the syndicated facility, denominated in euro see note 21.
Group treasury uses interest rate swaps to hedge certain exposures to movements in the relevant interbank lending rates, primarily the London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR and the Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate JIBAR.
Interest rate swaps are ordinarily formally designated as cash flow hedges and are fair valued at each reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps are determined at each reporting date by reference to the discounted contractual future cash flows, using the relevant currency-specific yield curves, and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents also act as a natural hedge against possible unfavourable movements in the relevant interbank lending rates on its variable rate debt, subject to any interest rate differentials that exist between corporate saving and lending rates.
Net variable rate debt sensitivity analysis The net variable rate exposure represents variable rate debt less the future cash outflows swapped from variable-to-fixed via interest rate swap instruments and cash and cash equivalents.
Reasonably possible changes in interest rates have been applied to net variable rate exposure, as denominated by currency, in order to provide an indication of the possible impact on the Groups combined and consolidated income statement.

The currencies swapped into out of and the amounts as at 31 December were as follows: E million 2012 2011 Long-dated contracts with tenures of more than 12 months Russian rouble 59 84 Short-dated contracts with tenures of less than 12 months Russian rouble 127 110 Czech koruna 51 80 US dollar 62 69 Pounds sterling 59 52 Swedish krona 13 16 Polish zloty 128 36 Other 29 28 Total swapped 410 403 Credit risk The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
Several Group entities have also issued certain financial guarantees to external counterparties in order to achieve competitive funding rates for specific debt agreements entered into by other Group entities.
None of these financial guarantees contractually obligates the Group to pay more than the recognised financial liabilities in the entities concerned.
As a result, these financial guarantee contracts have no bearing on the credit risk profile of the Group as a whole.
The Group has also provided committed loan facilities to Mondi Shanduka Newsprint.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables The Group has a large number of unrelated customers and does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any particular customer.
The Group believes that there is no significant geographical concentration of credit risk.
Each business segment manages its own exposure to credit risk according to the economic circumstances and characteristics of the relevant markets that they serve.
The Group believes that management of credit risk on a devolved basis enables it to assess and manage credit risk more effectively.
However, broad principles of credit risk management practice are observed across all business segments, such as the use of credit rating agencies, credit guarantee insurance, where appropriate, and the maintenance of a credit control function.
Of the total gross trade receivables balance of E880 million 2011: E734 million included in trade and other receivables reported in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position see note 19, credit insurance covering E615 million 2011: E577 million of the total balance has been taken out by the Groups trading entities to insure against the related credit default risk.
The insured cover is presented gross of contractually agreed excess amounts.
In addition, the Group is in possession of bank guarantees and letters of credit securing trade and other receivables to the value of E18 million 2011: E14 million.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and retrospectively assessed assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
The following table shows the amounts available to draw down on the Groups committed loan facilities: E million 2012 2011 Expiry date In one year or less 27 38 In more than one year 735 851 Total credit available 762 889 174 Integrated report and financial statements 2012 6313 12 Mondi IR Fins Final 2March13.
indd 174 2013 03 04 3:20 PM DIRECTORS REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 38 Financial risk management continued Forecast liquidity represents the Groups expected cash inflows, principally generated from sales made to customers, less the Groups contractually determined cash outflows, principally related to supplier payments and the repayment of borrowings, including finance lease obligations, plus the payment of any interest accruing thereon.
The matching of these cash inflows and outflows rests on the expected ageing profiles of the underlying assets and liabilities.
Short-term financial assets and financial liabilities are represented primarily by the Groups trade receivables and trade payables respectively.
The matching of the cash flows that result from trade receivables and trade payables typically takes place over a period of three to four months from recognition in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position and is managed to ensure the ongoing operating liquidity of the Group.
Financing cash outflows may be longer-term in nature.
The Group does not hold long-term financial assets to match against these commitments, but is significantly invested in long-term non-financial assets which generate the sustainable future cash inflows, net of future capital expenditure requirements, needed to service and repay the Groups borrowings.
The Group also assesses its commitments under interest rate swaps, which hedge future cash flows for two to five years from the reporting date presented.
Contractual maturity analysis Trade receivables, the principal class of non-derivative financial assets held by the Group, are settled gross by customers.
The Groups financial investments, which are not held for trading and therefore do not comprise part of the Groups liquidity planning arrangements, make up the remainder of the non-derivative financial assets held.
The following table presents the Groups outstanding contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The analysis presented is based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities, including any interest that will accrue, except where the Group is entitled and intends to repay a financial liability, or part of a financial liability, before its contractual maturity.
Non-interest bearing financial liabilities which are due to be settled in less than 12 months from maturity equal their carrying values, since the impact of the time value of money is immaterial over such a short duration.

Fair value estimation Financial instruments that are measured in the combined and consolidated statement of financial position at fair value require disclosure of fair value measurements by level based on the following fair value measurement hierarchy: level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives are determined using standard valuation techniques.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on Group specific estimates.
The significant inputs required to fair value all of the Groups financial instruments are observable.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments categorised as either level 1 or level 3 financial instruments.
Specific valuation methodologies used to value financial instruments include: the fair values of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts are calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable yield curves and exchange rates: the Groups commodity price derivatives are fair valued by independent third parties, who in turn calculate the fair values as the present value of expected future cash flows based on observable market data: and other techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Distributions Dividend distributions to the shareholders of Mondi plc are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the board.
Final dividends are accrued when approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting and interim dividends are accounted for when paid.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, less provision for any diminution in value.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, together with shortterm, highly liquid investments of a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
