Tax continued The tax rate for the year of 24.5% is a blended rate of 26% up to 1 April 2012 and 24% thereafter.
The tax charge for 2012 includes an exceptional credit of 13.3m arising from the reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 25% to 23% on 1 April 2013.
Future changes reducing the corporation tax rate by 2% to 21% on 1 April 2014 and a further 1% to 20% on 1 April 2015 have been announced, but not substantively enacted and therefore have not been taken into account.
If the government announced plans are fully enacted then the statutory rate of corporation tax will fall to 23.25% in 2013, 21.5% in 2014 and 20.25% in 2015.
