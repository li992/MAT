co. uk At 1 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 24 Provisions continued Reorganisation The reorganisation provision related to the final redundancy costs of the IT simplification project.
The provision has now been fully utilised.
Other Other provisions relate to warranties given on the disposal of businesses.
These are expected to be used over periods of up to five years.
25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, private placement loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The Board agrees policies for managing the risks summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term sterling debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix, on a long-term basis, between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
Most of the swaps held at the balance sheet date were entered into in January 2007 as part of a long-term fixing strategy.
At the year end, 407.4m 74.8% of Group debt was fixed for an average of 5.50 years 2011: 445.9m, 84.7%, for 3.75 years, using floating rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The intention is that the fixed rate debt ratio will reduce going forward as 100m of fixed rate debt expires within the financial year.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate debt was 5.3% 2010 11: 5.5%.
Although the private placement loan notes are US dollar denominated, cross-currency swaps mean that the interest rate risk is effectively sterling only.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of the hedging instruments in place at 1 March 2012 and 3 March 2011 respectively.
Consequently, the analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: B alance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move: G ains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 2: and Cash flow hedges were effective.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1ppt change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1.3m 2010 11: 0.7m, and equity by approximately 7.8m 2011: 11.3m.
Liquidity risk In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts and bank loans.
This strategy includes monitoring the maturity of financial liabilities to avoid the risk of a shortage of funds.
Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.

The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups maximum exposure on its trade and other receivables is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 20.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, the Groups exposure arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group seeks to minimise the risk of default in relation to cash and cash equivalents by spreading investments across a number of counterparties.
In the event that any of the Groups banks get into financial difficulties the Group is exposed to the risk of withdrawal of currently undrawn committed facilities.
This risk is mitigated by the Group having a range of counterparties to its facilities and by maintaining headroom.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange exposure is currently not significant to the Group.
Although the Group has US dollar denominated loan notes these have been swapped into sterling thereby eliminating foreign currency risk.
Sensitivity analysis has therefore not been carried out.
Overseas investments are generally start-up businesses undertaken through joint venture arrangements.
The Group monitors the growth and risks associated with its overseas operations and will undertake hedging activities as and whenthey are required.
Capital management The Groups primary objective in regard to capital management is to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern and has sufficient funds at its disposal to grow the business for the benefit of shareholders.
The Group seeks to maintain a ratio of debt to equity that balances risks and returns and also complies with lending covenants.
See pages 18 and 19 of this report for the policies and objectives of the Board regarding capital management, analysis of the Groups credit facilities and financing plans for the coming years.
The Group aims to maintain sufficient funds for working capital and future investment in order to meet growth targets.
The Group has adopted a framework to keep leverage debt divided by EBITDA on a pensions lease adjusted basis at 3.5 times or below which was achieved for the year ended 1 March 2012.
This calculation takes account of net debt, pensions deficit and capital value of leases.
The management of equity through share buy backs and new issues is considered as part of the overall leverage framework balanced against the funding requirements of future growth.
