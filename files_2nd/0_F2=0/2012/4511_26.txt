Overview Business review Corporate governance report Financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Segmental analysis The Group has two business units, Currency and Solutions.
Currency is a single operating unit.
Solutions consist of three operating units: Cash Processing Solutions, Security Products and Identity Systems.
The Board, which is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker, monitors the performance of the Group at an operating unit level and there are therefore four reportable segments.
The principal financial information reviewed by the Board is revenue and operating profit before exceptional items, measured on an IFRS basis.

A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: 2012 2011 m m Currency 4.3 4.3 Cash Processing Solutions 3.4 3.5 7.7 7.8 The majority of the goodwill relates to the acquisition of CSI Inc in 2001 which was allocated to Currency and Cash Processing Solutions on the basis that the acquired business generated synergies for both CGUs.
The estimates of recoverable amount are based on value in use calculations which are based on cash ow projections covering a five year period based on the latest projections approved by management plus a terminal year.
The key assumptions underlying these projections are summarised below: a Currency: The volume and price of orders secured, particularly in respect of banknotes and banknote papers, are based on a combination of the current order book and past experience, taking into account: i Expectations in respect of economic growth and central banks banknote circulation policies ii The Groups knowledge of its customer base, gained through its long standing relationships with them Material input prices and foreign exchange rates are also factors but are not considered significant in the context of the headroom available in the calculations.
b Cash Processing Solutions: Unit sales of large sorters and the extent of maintenance income generated from these sales are based on a combination of orders on hand and past experience The pre tax discount rate used for both Currency and Cash Processing Solutions was 13.2 per cent 2010 11: 13.4 per cent.
The discount rates applied take into account the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC and the relative risks associated with the CGUs operations.
The post tax discount rate used is unchanged compared to the prior year, reecting the fact that the Groups WACC has not changed and the risks associated with the CGUs in question have not materially changed.
Cash ows beyond the period covered by the projections have been held constant.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed and management do not consider there to be any reasonably possible change in assumptions that could result in the assets recoverable amounts falling below their book values.

fide La Rue Annual Report 2012 72 Overview Business review Corporate governance report Financial statements 12 Financial risk Financial risk management Overview The Groups Treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is responsible for the management of financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are liquidity risk, market risk and credit risk.
The Groups financial risk management policies are established and reviewed regularly to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Group Treasury identies, evaluates and in certain cases hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
Group Treasury provides written principles for overall financial risk management as well as policies covering specic areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents.
The level of headroom needed is reviewed annually as part of the Groups planning process.
A maturity analysis of the carrying amount of the Groups borrowings is shown overleaf in the reporting of financial risk section together with associated fair values.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return: a Currency risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities, unrecognised rm commitments and investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each currency via foreign exchange contracts transacted with financial institutions.
The Groups risk management policy aims to hedge rm commitments at between 60 per cent and 100 per cent of forecast exposures in each major currency for the subsequent 12 months to the extent that forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
The Groups policy is to manage the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies and through foreign currency swaps.
The Groups policy is not to hedge net investments in subsidiaries or the translation of profits or losses generated in overseas subsidiaries.
b Interest rate risk All material financial assets and liabilities are maintained at oating rates of interest.
Where the Group has forecast average levels of net debt above 50m on a continuing basis, oating to xed interest rate swaps will be used to x the interest rate on a minimum of 50 per cent of the Groups net debt for a period of at least 12 months.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an inuence on credit risk.
Geographically, there is no concentration of credit risk.
Where appropriate, letters of credit are used to mitigate the credit risk from customers.
The Group has established a credit policy that ensures that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
The Group has a policy to procure advance payments during order negotiation which further reduces credit risk.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions and the Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.

The valuation bases are classied according to the degree of estimation required in arriving at the fair values.
Level 1 valuations are derived from unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets, level 2 valuations use observable inputs for the assets or liabilities other than quoted prices, while level 3 valuations are not based on observable market data and are subject to management estimates.
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging The fair value of forward exchange contracts has been determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps are measured by reference to third party bank conrmations and discounted cash ows using the yield curves in effect at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives The fair value of embedded derivatives is calculated based on the present value of forecast future exposures on relevant sales and purchase contracts and using quoted forward foreign exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The movement in fair value of embedded derivatives is shown within revenue or operating expenses as appropriate, depending on the nature of the transaction.
Determination of fair values of non derivative financial assets and liabilities Trade and other receivables and payables Due to their short maturities, trade and other payables, and trade and other receivables have been stated at their book values which approximate their fair values.
Non derivative financial liabilities Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The interest rates used to discount estimated cash ows, where applicable, are based on sterling LIBOR.
At 31 March 2012 the discount rate used was 1.0 per cent 2010 11: 1.0 per cent.

Earnings per share and dividend payments are the two measures which, in the Boards view, summarise best whether the Groups objectives regarding equity management are being met.
The Groups earnings and dividends per share and relative rates of growth illustrate the extent to which equity attributable to shareholders has changed.
Both measures are disclosed and discussed within the Business review and notes 6 and 7.
The Groups objective is to maximise sustainable long term growth of the earnings per share.
fide La Rues dividend policy is to provide shareholders with a competitive return on their investment, while assuring sufficient reinvestment of profits to enable the Group to achieve its strategy.
The dividend per share objective is monitored against the target of a full year dividend cover of 1.75 times.
The decision to pay dividends, and the amount of the dividends, will depend on, among other things the earnings, financial position, capital requirements, general business conditions, cash ows, net debt levels and share buy back plans.

Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses available to carry forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of 1.7m 2010 11: 3.2m in respect of losses amounting to 7.0m 2010 11: 12.6m that can be carried forward against future taxable income.
Similarly, the Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets of 16.3m 2010 11: 18.5m in respect of overseas tax credits that are carried forward for utilisation in future periods.
Deferred income tax liabilities have not been recognised for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it was considered unlikely that dividends would be paid from those subsidiaries.
UK capital losses of 330.2m are carried forward at 31 March 2012 2010 11: 337.0m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses.
UK tax rate A reduction in the UK tax rate from 26 per cent to 25 per cent effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and a further reduction to 24 per cent effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012.
This will reduce the Groups future tax charge accordingly.
The UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2012 have been calculated based on the rate of 24 per cent substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A further reduction to the main rate was announced in the 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 reducing the rate by an additional 1 per cent to 23 per cent from April 2013 and a further 1 per cent to 22 per cent from April 2014.
These amendments were not substantively enacted at 31 March 2012 and therefore have not been reected in the deferred tax gures on the Balance Sheet.

While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that adequate provision has been made to cover these matters.
The Group provides guarantees and performance bonds which are issued in the ordinary course of business.
In the event that a guarantee or bond is called, provision may be required subject to the particular circumstances, including an assessment of its recoverability.
In July 2010 the Board commissioned an investigation by external lawyers into issues that had been brought to its attention internally.
The investigation, which was completed in October 2010, found nothing of substance to support the matters raised other than in respect of some paper production issues where it was found that a small number of the many detailed specication parameters of some paper had fallen marginally short of specication.
It was also established that certain paper specication test certicates had been deliberately falsified.
The Board reported the findings of the investigation to the appropriate authorities, who are considering the matter, and has implemented a number of measures arising from the findings of the investigation.
Provision, as described in note 3: Exceptional items, has been made for the costs associated with the paper production issues identied at this stage including the write off of trade receivables and other costs relating to the investigation, production and rectification of these matters.
Provision has not been made for the potential cost of resolutions or for potential fines from regulatory authorities.
The nature and extent of these resolutions will be the subject of ongoing discussions, the outcome of which cannot be estimated reliably at present.
The timing, response and outcome of the consideration by the authorities of the reported findings of the investigation is also uncertain and the financial consequences, if any, cannot be estimated reliably at present.
