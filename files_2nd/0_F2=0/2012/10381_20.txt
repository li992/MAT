Segmental analysis IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be based on the Groups internal reporting to its Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM is regarded as the Chief Executive together with other Board members.
The CODM uses profit before interest and exceptional items operating profit pre-exceptionals as the key measure of the segment results.
Group assets are reviewed as part of this process but are not presented on a segment basis.
The retail operating business operates all of the Groups retail operating units and generates all of its external revenue.
The property business holds the Groups freehold and long leasehold property portfolio and derives all of its income from the internal rent levied against the Groups retail operating units.
The internal rent charge is eliminated at the total Group level.

Share-based payments The net charge recognised for share-based payments in the year is nil 2011 6m, following the reversal of prior year provision for the Long Term Incentive Plan of 3.2m.
The Group had seven share schemes, all of which are equity-settled, in operation during the year.
The vesting of all awards or options is generally dependent upon participants remaining in the employment of a participating company during the vesting period.
Details of schemes remaining as at 29 September 2012 are shown below: Sharesave Plan The Sharesave Plan is an HMRC approved savings scheme, whereby the proceeds from a savings contract, of either three or five years duration, may be used to purchase shares under option providing the employee remains in employment until the contract matures.
Options are typically granted in June or July of each year, at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares at the date of invitation.
There are no performance conditions.
The scheme is open to all UK employees provided that they have at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The vesting period is 39 months or 63 months and options may be exercised up to six months after the vesting date.
Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan is an HMRC approved savings scheme open to all UK employees with at least 12 months service at the date of invitation.
The plan awards free shares to participating employees up to a maximum award of 3,000 per employee per year, with individual value being pro-rated on salary.
There are no performance conditions other than remaining in employment for two years from the date of award: hence there is a vesting period of two years from the award date.
Shares are generally held in the Share Incentive Plan Trust for at least three years and are capable of being released to participants at any time thereafter.
Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan Under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan the annual bonuses of the Executive Directors and other eligible employees may be deferred into Mitchells & Butlers plc shares.
From the 2009 10 bonus year onwards, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, at least 50% of the annual bonus for the Executive Directors and any excess over 75% of base salary earned in the year for the other eligible employees, will normally be deferred and released in equal tranches 12 and 24 months after deferral.
Participants may receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
If a participant leaves the employment of the Group before the Release Dates, then in certain circumstances they may lose entitlement to Bonus Shares and Dividend Accrued Shares.
All deferrals of bonuses into shares to date have been entirely at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Long-Term Incentive Plan An award was made under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP on 30 July 2010 to Executive Directors and other employees who would otherwise have been eligible to participate in the Performance Restricted Share Plan.
Participants have been awarded a conditional right to receive Mitchells & Butlers plc shares with a value determined by their percentage of the LTIP pool.
As at 29 September 2012, 53.27% of the total pool was allocated.
The size of the LTIP pool is calculated based upon achieving a three year growth in market capitalisation of the Company in excess of the Hurdle Amount market capitalisation at award date plus 10% growth per annum, adjusted downwards for any dividends paid over the three year performance period ending on 29 July 2013.
The LTIP pool is capped at 100m with any excess over this amount requiring Remuneration Committee approval.
Overall vesting of awards is also dependent upon the achievement of an adjusted earnings per share underpin whereby the award is capable of vesting only if adjusted EPS growth from financial year 2010 to 2013 is at least equal to RPI plus 12 percentage points.
If the EPS condition is not met no awards vest.
Whilst the scheme remains operational, the Directors believe that it is unlikely that the performance condition will be achieved and a provision of 3.2m has been released in the current year.
Performance Restricted Share Plan The Performance Restricted Share Plan allows Executive Directors and other eligible employees to receive nominal cost options, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, set by the Remuneration Committee, which are normally measured over a three year period.
Vesting for the single remaining award made in November 2009 is conditional upon the achievement of a Total Shareholder Return TSR performance condition.
It is also dependent upon an adjusted earnings per share growth performance condition.
This final scheme is due to vest in November 2012.
In respect of the TSR performance condition, Monte Carlo simulations were performed to incorporate the market condition in the measurement of the fair value.
For the award made in November 2009 this is based upon an index of our competitors.
Participants will be entitled to receive Dividend Accrued Shares on vesting equal to the value of the ordinary dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the performance period.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 55 Notes to the financial statements For the 53 weeks ended 29 September 2012 continued 6.
Share-based payments continued Executive Share Option Plan The grant of options under the Executive Share Option Plan was discontinued following shareholder approval of changes to Executive Director remuneration in 2006.
The vesting period for these options is three years from grant, followed by a seven year exercise period.
The latest possible exercise date for any of these options outstanding at 29 September 2012, is 24 May 2015.
The Group has used separate option pricing models and assumptions for each plan.
The following tables set out weighted average information about how the fair value of each option grant was calculated: Long-Term Incentive Sharesave 2012 Plan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo Black-Scholes a Weighted average share price 264.8p 249.0p Exercise price 182.0p b Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% Risk-free interest rate 0.73% 0.58% c Volatility 33.0% 36.2% d Expected life years 3.72 3.95 Long-Term Incentive Sharesave 2011 Plan Plan Valuation model Monte Carlo Black-Scholes a Weighted average share price 333.5p 315.0p Exercise price 253.0p b Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00% Risk-free interest rate 1.23% 1.84% c Volatility 52.6% 47.5% d Expected life years 3.70 4.04 a.
During the period an additional 4.53% 2011 14.49% of the pool was awarded at a weighted average share price of 264.8p 2011 333.5p.
The share price for the 2010 LTIP multiplied by the number of shares in issue on award date gives the market capitalisation at date of grant of 1,275m, which has been used to calculate the Hurdle Amount.
There is no exercise price associated with the LTIP.
The expected dividend yield for the Sharesave Plan and LTIP has used historical dividend information.
For details on the Groups current dividend policy refer to the Financial review on page 16. c. The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price commensurate with the expected term of the options and share awards.
d. The expected life of the options represents the average length of time between grant date and exercise date.
The fair value of awards under the Short-Term Deferred Incentive Plan and the Share Incentive Plan are equal to the share price on the date of award as there is no price to be paid and employees are entitled to Dividend Accrued Shares.
The assumptions set out above are therefore not relevant to these schemes.

Pensions Background Retirement and death benefits are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
These plans are funded, HMRC approved, occupational pension schemes with defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
On 2 November 2010, Mitchells & Butlers plc concluded a process of consultation and review with the Trustees, in which it considered proposals to close the defined benefit plan to future accrual.
The ceasing of future accrual for this plan became effective from 13 March 2011.
At the same time Mitchells & Butlers plc implemented a revised defined contribution benefit structure.
As a result of this change a curtailment charge of 13m was incurred during 2011, which was included within exceptional items, see note 8.
The defined benefit liability relates to these funded plans, together with an unfunded unapproved pension arrangement the Executive Top-Up Scheme, or MABETUS in respect of certain MABEPP members.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
Measurement of scheme assets and liabilities IAS 19 The valuations used for IAS 19 purposes are based on the results of the latest full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 March 2010 and updated by the schemes independent qualified actuaries to 29 September 2012.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 29 September 2012 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
IAS 19 requires that the scheme liabilities are discounted using market yields at the end of the period on high quality corporate bonds see discount rate assumption in the table below.
The IAS 19 deficit calculated on this basis is 88m 2011 37m.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
Principal financial assumptions The principal financial assumptions adopted following the advice of independent qualified actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2012 2011 a a Wages and salaries increases 2.0% 2.0% Pensions increases 2.8% 3.1% Discount rate 4.3% 5.2% Inflation rate 2.8% 3.2% a.
Reflects the impact of pension changes introduced during the prior period.
The discount rate applied to the pension schemes liabilities is a significant driver of the net balance sheet valuation of the schemes and is subject to a high degree of judgement and complexity.
It is estimated that a 0.1% increase or decrease in the discount rate used would, in isolation, reduce or increase the net balance sheet deficit by approximately 32m 2011 26m, with no material impact on the income statement charge.
A similar increase or decrease of 0.1% in the inflation rate would, in isolation, increase or reduce the net balance sheet deficit by approximately 30m 2011 24m.
58 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Overview Financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions were reviewed following the full actuarial valuation in March 2010 and are based on the S1NA mortality tables for the MABPP and S1NA light tables for the MABEPP.
An allowance was made for medium cohort projection with a 1% underpin.
Ages are rated up by one year for pensioners of the MABPP and rated down by two years for all members of the MABEPP.
Assumptions are consistent across both current and previous period.
A summary of the average life expectancies assumed is as follows: 2012 2011 Main plan Exec plan Main plan Exec plan years years years years Male member aged 65 current life expectancy 20.3 24.6 20.3 24.6 Male member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 23.0 26.4 23.0 26.4 Female member aged 65 current life expectancy 23.1 26.0 23.1 26.0 Female member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 25.8 28.0 25.8 28.0 Amounts recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes The long-term rates of return on assets at 29 September 2012 shown below form the basis of the calculation of the expected return on pension scheme assets for the 2013 financial year.
The 2011 rates shown are used in calculating the 2012 expected return.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in a weighted average assumption of 4.5% 2011 5.2%.
The actual investment return achieved on the scheme assets over the year was 11.2% 2011 5.8%, which represented a gain of 162m 2011 gain of 79m.
The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP, their expected rates of return and the value of the pension scheme assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date can be summarised as follows: 2012 2011 Long-term Long-term rates rates of return of return expected Value expected Value % m % m Equities 6.9 488 6.9 420 Bonds 3.2 1,058 3.7 999 Other 4.9 64 5.5 53 Fair value of assets 1,610 1,472 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,698 1,509 Deficit in the schemes recognised as a liability in the balance sheet 88 37 Associated deferred tax asset note 19 20 9 The following amounts relating to the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements have been recognised in the Group income statement and Group statement of comprehensive income: 2012 2011 53 weeks 52 weeks Group income statement m m Operating profit: Current service cost defined benefit plans 4 Current service cost defined contribution plans 5 4 Total current service cost 5 8 Exceptional pension charge 13 Charge to operating profit 5 21 Finance income: Expected return on pension scheme assets 66 74 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 77 79 Net finance charge in respect of pensions 11 5 Total charge 16 26 2012 2011 53 weeks 52 weeks Group statement of comprehensive income m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 96 5 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 177 79 Actuarial loss gain recognised 81 84 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 59 Notes to the financial statements For the 53 weeks ended 29 September 2012 continued 7.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 26 September 2004.
Funding valuation and future funding obligations The results of the 2010 actuarial valuation showed a funding deficit of 400m, using a more prudent basis to discount the scheme liabilities than is required by IAS 19 and on 21 July 2010 the Company formally agreed a 10 year recovery plan with the Trustees to close the funding deficit in respect of its pension scheme liabilities.
The result of this was that the Group agreed to increase additional contributions from 24m to 40m per annum, commencing from 1 April 2010, in each of the financial years to 2019 and 20m in financial year 2020.
This agreement is subject to review at the next full actuarial valuation in 2013.
In the 53 weeks ended 29 September 2012 the Group paid 5m 2011 4m, 2010 3m in respect of the defined contribution arrangements, with nil 2011 nil outstanding as at the year end.
At 29 September 2012 the MABPP owed 2m 2011 2m to the Group in respect of expenses paid on its behalf.
This amount is included in other receivables in note 15.

The Finance Act 2012 was enacted on 17 July 2012 and reduced the main rate of corporation tax from 25% to 23% from 1 April 2013.
The effect of this change has been reflected on the closing deferred tax balance shown in note 19.
A further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax is proposed to be enacted separately with the aim of reducing the rate to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The reduction in the corporation tax rate is likely to result in a further reduction in the net deferred tax liability provided at 29 September 2012 of approximately 12m.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS has been calculated by dividing the profit or loss for the financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in treasury and by employee share trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share amounts are presented before exceptional items and other adjustments and the net pensions finance charge see note 8 in order to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

As part of the detailed preparatory work being undertaken by the Group in advance of investment in a new financial and management accounting system, a number of historical adjustments made to the fixed asset register have been reviewed and are believed to no longer be required.
These adjustments have no impact on the carrying value of the assets and have been removed from the general ledger.
In accordance with IAS 8 the opening cost and accumulated depreciation at 25 September 2010 has been restated to reflect these adjustments.
The opening cost has increased by 293m being an increase of 117m to land and buildings and an increase of 176m to the cost of fixtures, fittings and equipment and an adjustment has been recorded to restate the brought forward accumulated depreciation at 25 September 2010 by 293m being an increase of 102m to the accumulated depreciation of land and buildings and an increase of 191m to the accumulated depreciation of fixtures, fittings and equipment.
There is no impact on the net book value of property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet.
c. The impact of the property revaluation is a net book value decrease of 25m 2011 81m increase comprising an impairment of 35m 2011 8m surplus net of a revaluation reserve credit of 10m 2011 73m shown in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
In addition, a review of the short leasehold and unlicensed property estate has resulted in an impairment of 12m 2011 10m see note 8.
Certain assets with a net book value of 33m 2011 33m owned by the Group are subject to a fixed charge in respect of liabilities held by the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Top-Up Scheme MABETUS.
64 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Overview Financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Properties A policy of valuing the majority of the Groups freehold and long leasehold licensed properties, for accounting purposes, was adopted on 29 September 2007.
Short leasehold properties, unlicensed properties and fixtures, fittings and equipment are held at cost less depreciation and impairment.
The Group accounts for long leasehold land as an operating lease.
The freehold and long leasehold properties have been valued at market value, as at 29 September 2012 using information provided by CBRE 24 September 2011 by Colliers International UK plc, independent chartered surveyors.
The valuation was carried out in accordance with the provisions of RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards The Red Book assuming each asset is sold as part of the continuing enterprise in occupation individually as a fully operational trading entity.
The market value has been determined having regard to factors such as current and future projected income levels taking account of location, quality of the pub restaurant and recent market transactions in the sector.
Changes in these assumptions such as the valuation basis applied in comparable market transactions, or the income level generated by a pub could materially impact the valuation of the freehold and long leasehold properties.
It is estimated that a 1 change in the EBITDA of the freehold and long leasehold properties would generate approximately 8m movement in their valuation.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment which are not revalued to fair market value are reviewed on an outlet basis for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets with a net book value of 3,541m 2011 3,594m, which are pledged as security for the securitisation debt and over which there are certain restrictions on title.
a Net book value The split of the net book value of land and buildings is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Freehold 2,984 2,967 Long leasehold 253 260 Short leasehold 107 108 Total land and buildings net book value 3,344 3,335 a.
The carrying value of freehold and long leasehold land and buildings based on their historical cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS is 2,070m and 166m respectively 2011 2,078m and 170m.
In addition to the above, premiums paid on acquiring a new lease are classified separately in the balance sheet.

All amounts fall due within one year.
Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing and are classified as loans and receivables and are therefore held at amortised cost.
Trade and other receivables past due and not impaired are immaterial and therefore no further analysis is presented.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximately equates to their face value.

Non-current other payables comprise an amount held in respect of the Groups gaming machine VAT claim.
A decision was released during 2010 in respect of Rank plcs gaming claim and this ruling fell in the taxpayers favour.
As a result, the Group was able to further pursue its own gaming claim which was submitted in April 2006.
HMRC agreed to make a repayment of the existing claim, subject to the Group providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision is overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
HMRC lodged an appeal with the European Court of Justice ECJ in 2010 in respect of Rank plcs decision.
The ECJ released its decision on the Rank plc case on 11 November 2011.
The outcome is still uncertain as a hearing in the UK Upper Tribunal in June 2012 concluded that the original Rank plc hearing in the First Tier Tribunal FTT made an error of law and therefore needs to reconsider the case in line with the ECJ findings.
No date has been set for the FTT hearing.
The Group continues to hold the original repayment amount of 12m as a liability until there is more certainty as to the outcome of this appeal.

The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other Group companies.
At 29 September 2012, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had cash and cash equivalents of 133m 2011 135m which were governed by the covenants associated with the securitisation.
Of this amount 42m 2011 44m, representing disposal proceeds, was held on deposit in an account over which there are a number of restrictions.
The use of this cash requires the approval of the securitisation trustee and may only be used for certain specified purposes such as capital enhancement expenditure and business acquisitions.
The carrying value of the securitised debt in the Group balance sheet at 29 September 2012 is analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Principal outstanding at beginning of period 2,255 2,299 Principal repaid during the period 52 49 Exchange on translation of dollar loan notes 11 5 Principal outstanding at end of period 2,192 2,255 Deferred issue costs 10 12 Accrued interest 4 3 Carrying value at end of period 2,186 2,246 Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The Group holds an undrawn 295m 2011 295m liquidity facility against the securitised arrangements, sized to cover 18 months debt service, which is not available for any other purpose.
This facility will expire on 30 August 2013.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Groups Treasury function is governed by a Board Treasury Policy Statement which details the key objectives and policies for the Groups treasury management.
The Treasury Committee ensures that the Treasury Policy is adhered to, monitors its operation and agrees appropriate strategies for recommendation to the Board.
The Treasury Policy Statement is reviewed annually, with recommendations for change made to the Board, as appropriate.
The Group Treasury function is operated as a cost centre and is the only area of the business permitted to transact treasury deals.
It must also be consulted on other related matters such as the provision of guarantees or the financial implications of contract terms.
An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives and strategies is set out below.
The main financial risks which impact the Group result from funding and liquidity risk, credit risk, capital risk and market risk, principally as a result of changes in interest and currency rates.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate and foreign currency swaps, are used to manage market risk.
Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes.
Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 67 Notes to the financial statements For the 53 weeks ended 29 September 2012 continued 18.
Financial instruments continued Funding and liquidity risk In order to ensure that the Groups long-term funding strategy is aligned with its strategic objectives, the Treasury Committee regularly assesses the maturity profile of the Groups debt, alongside the prevailing financial projections.
This enables it to ensure that funding levels are appropriate to support the Groups plans.
The current funding arrangements of the Group consist of the securitised notes issued by Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc and associated liquidity facility.
The terms of the securitisation contain a number of financial covenants.
Compliance with these covenants is monitored by Group Treasury.
The Group prepares a rolling daily cash forecast covering a six week period and an annual cash forecast by period.
These forecasts are reviewed on a daily basis and used to manage the investment and borrowing requirements of the Group.
A combination of cash pooling and zero balancing agreements are in place to ensure the optimum liquidity position is maintained.
The Group maintains sufficient cash balances or committed facilities outside the securitisation to ensure that it can meet its medium-term anticipated cash flow requirements.
The maturity table below details the contractual undiscounted cash flows both principal and interest for the Groups financial liabilities, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
Trade and other payables note 16 are short-term and excluded from the table.
Includes the impact of the cash flow hedges.
Credit risk The Group Treasury function enters into contracts with third parties in respect of derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes and the investment of surplus funds.
These activities expose the Group to credit risk against the counterparties.
To mitigate this exposure, Group Treasury operates policies that restrict the investment of surplus funds and the entering into of derivative transactions to counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A long-term and A1 P1 F1 short-term.
Counterparties may also be required to post collateral with the Group, where their credit rating falls below a predetermined level.
An amount of 7m 2011 31m of collateral was posted by a swap provider within the securitisation as at 29 September 2012.
The amount that can be invested or transacted at various ratings levels is restricted under the policy.
To minimise credit risk exposure against individual counterparties, investments and derivative transactions are entered into with a range of counterparties.
The Group Treasury function reviews credit ratings, as published by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, current exposure levels and the maximum permitted exposure at given credit ratings, for each counterparty on a daily basis.
Any exceptions are required to be formally reported to the Treasury Committee on a four weekly basis.
Included in other receivables are amounts due from certain Group suppliers.
At the period end and included in trade and other payables are amounts due to some of these suppliers.
This reduces the Groups credit exposure.
The Groups credit exposure as at 29 September 2012 was: 2012 2011 m m Cash and cash equivalents 311 306 Other cash deposits 25 50 Trade receivables 1 a Other receivables 23 20 b Derivatives 4 18 a.
The Group may have a right of offset against certain amounts held within this balance.
As disclosed in note 15 and 16, the Group has 7m 2011 31m of cash collateral which is not included in this balance.
68 Mitchells & Butlers plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Overview Financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Capital management The Groups capital base is comprised of its net debt analysed in note 25 plus total equity disclosed on the face of the Group balance sheet.
The objective is to maintain a capital base which is sufficiently strong to support the ongoing development of the business as a going concern, including the amenity and cash flow generation of the pub estate.
By keeping debt see also Funding and liquidity risk above and headroom against its debt facilities at an appropriate level, the Group ensures that it maintains a strong credit position, whilst maximising value for shareholders and adhering to its covenants and other restrictions associated with its debt see note 17.
In managing its capital structure, from time to time the Group may realise value from non-core assets, buy back or issue new shares, initiate and vary its dividend payments and seek to vary or accelerate debt repayments.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the maturity of its debt profile supports its strategic objectives.
The Board considers the latest covenant compliance, headroom projections and projected balance sheet positions at each of its meetings, based on the advice of the Treasury Committee which meets on a four weekly basis.
The Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Treasurer and monitors Treasury performance and compliance with Board-approved policies.
The Group Finance Director is also a member of the Committee.
Total capital at 29 September 2012 is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Net debt note 25 1,841 1,870 Total equity 1,088 1,092 Total capital 2,929 2,962 Market risk The Group is exposed to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of its financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises foreign currency and interest rate risk.
Foreign currency risk The Group faces currency risk in two main areas: US$407m of Class A3N floating rate notes which form part of the securitised debt see note 17.
At issuance of the notes, the Group entered into a cross currency interest rate swap to manage the foreign currency exposure resulting from both the US$ principal and initial interest elements of the notes.
Further to the step-up on the A3N notes on 15 December 2010, the Group has additional foreign currency exposure as a result of the increase in US$ interest payable.
A movement of 10% in the US$ exchange rate would have nil 2011 nil impact on the reported Group profit and net assets.
The Group has no significant profit and loss exposure as a result of retranslating monetary assets and liabilities at different exchange rates.
As the Group is predominantly UK based and acquires the majority of its supplies in sterling, it has no significant direct currency exposure from its operations.
Interest rate risk The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt instruments and manages the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates by using derivative financial instruments.
Where the necessary criteria are met, the Group minimises the volatility in its financial statements through the adoption of the hedge accounting provisions permitted under IAS 39.
The interest rate exposure resulting from the Groups 2.2bn securitisation is largely fixed, either as a result of the notes themselves being issued at fixed interest rates, or through a combination of floating rate notes against which effective interest rate swaps are held, which are eligible for hedge accounting.
The Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis point movement in interest rates is detailed below: 2012 2011 m m a Interest income 3 3 b Interest expense 1 Profit impact 3 2 c Derivative financial instruments fair values 124 126 Total equity 127 128 a.
Represents interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents these are defined in note 25. b.
The element of interest expense which is not matched by payments and receipts under cash flow hedges see below which would otherwise offset the interest rate exposure of the Group.
c. The impact on total equity from movements in the fair value of cash flow hedges see below.
Derivative financial instruments Cash flow hedges Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cash flow hedges detailed below have been assessed as being highly effective during the financial period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
During the period a loss of 103m 2011 118m on cash flow hedges was recognised in equity.
A loss of 54m 2011 37m was recycled from equity and included in the Group income statement for the period.

The cash flows on these contracts occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR and paying a fixed rate of 4.8856% 2011 4.8904%.
The contract maturity dates match those of the hedged item.
The ten interest rate swaps above are held on the balance sheet at fair market value, which is a liability of 325m 2011 278m.
At 29 September 2012 the Group held one 2011 one cross currency interest rate swap contract, with a nominal value of 233m 2011 243m, designated as a hedge of the cash flow interest rate and currency risk of the Groups A3N floating rate $390m 2011 $407m borrowings.
The cross currency interest rate swap is held on the balance sheet at a fair value asset of 4m 2011 17m.
The cash flows on this contract occur quarterly, receiving a floating rate of interest based on US$ LIBOR and paying a floating rate of interest at LIBOR in sterling.
