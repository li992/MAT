149 39 Acquisitions in the prior year i Acquisition of HI Tricomm Holdings Limited On 4 February 2011 Grainger acquired the HI Tricomm Holdings Limited HITHL group including its trading subsidiary Tricomm Housing Limited THL from Invista Castle Limited.
The main reason for the acquisition was reflective of Graingers strategy to diversify its assets into selective areas of value or growth.
THL owns a high quality portfolio of 317 freehold houses in five separate locations around the Bristol and Portsmouth areas and the assets are high yielding.
The houses are let under a long-term lease arrangement with the Secretary of State for Defence until 2028 providing a consistent revenue stream.
The fair value at acquisition of the total consideration transferred amounted to 6.8m.
The acquisition has been treated as a business combination and resulted in a gain on acquisition of 14.9m.
This gain on acquisition arose due to it being a bargain purchase reflecting the particular situation of the vendors and their requirement to dispose of HITHL quickly.
The identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were as follows: m Assets Investment property 105.4 Cash and cash equivalents 5.4 Trade and other receivables 0.8 Deferred tax assets 2.3 113.9 Liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 67.6 Trade and other payables 2.1 Deferred tax liabilities 2.2 Loan notes payable 9.5 Amounts payable to Invista Castle Limited 2.2 Derivative financial instruments 8.6 92.2 Net assets acquired 21.7 Fair value of consideration paid 6.8 Gain on acquisition 14.9 Investment property acquired of 105.4m represents its fair value.
For the acquired trade and other receivables the above values represent the fair values.
They are the expected amounts receivable and, at the acquisition date, there are no amounts not expected to be collected.
Trade and other payables primarily represent amounts payable for bank interest, corporation tax and VAT.
There was no contingent consideration and there are no contingent liabilities that have not been recognised.
In addition to the consideration of 6.8m for the share capital of HITHL, Grainger settled on acquisition the amount of 2.2m payable to Invista Castle Limited by the HITHL group and Grainger also acquired a loan note receivable plus accrued interest thereon totalling 9.5m from Invista Castle Limited.
The loan note payable was part of the liabilities acquired as shown in the above table.
All three amounts together made up the total consideration of 18.5m which was paid in cash.
Grainger plc 150 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued 39 Acquisitions in the prior year continued The post acquisition revenue and profit before tax included in the groups consolidated income statement for year to 30 September 2011 were 5.9m and 2.0m respectively.
Had the acquisition taken place on 1 October 2010, we estimate on a pro forma basis, that the revenue and profit of HITHL for the 12 month period from that date to be consolidated in the 2011 group accounts would have been 8.9m and 3.1m respectively.
ii Acquisition of 50% equity in Grainger GenInvest LLPs On 22 March 2011, Grainger acquired the 50% interest of Genesis Housing Group in the two Grainger GenInvest LLPs thereby becoming the sole owner of both entities.
The main reason for the acquisition is as part of Graingers strategy to diversify its assets into selective areas of value or growth.
The partnerships own c. 1,650 properties in Central London where we believe there are good prospects for long-term capital appreciation.
The fair value at acquisition of the total consideration transferred amounted to 15.0m and was paid in cash.
This consideration was paid to acquire the remaining 50% equity in Grainger GenInvest LLP.
No consideration was paid for the remaining 50% equity in Grainger GenInvest No.
The acquisition has been treated as a business combination and resulted in a gain on acquisition of Grainger GenInvest LLP of 1.2m.
This gain on acquisition arose due to it being a bargain purchase and reflected the particular situation of the vendor and the requirement to re-finance the debt in the two LLPs.
The identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were as follows: m Assets Investment property 102.4 Trading property 186.9 Cash and cash equivalents 5.0 294.3 Liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 187.0 Trade and other payables 2.7 Interest bearing loans due to Grainger 72.2 261.9 Net assets acquired 32.4 50% of net assets acquired 16.2 Fair value of consideration paid 15.0 Gain on acquisition 1.2 Investment and trading property acquired of 289.3m in aggregate, represents its fair value.
Trade and other payables primarily represent amounts payable to external suppliers and for bank interest.
The post acquisition revenue and profit before tax included in the groups consolidated income statement for year to 30 September 2011 were 6.6m and 4.6m respectively.
Had the acquisition taken place on 1 October 2010, we estimate on a pro forma basis, that the revenue and profit of Grainger GenInvest LLP for the 12 month period from that date to be consolidated in the 2011 group accounts would have been 12.0m and 5.7m respectively.
