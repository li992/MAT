It excludes the operating investment return on shareholder net assets, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets : ii Fee income represents pro ts driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses : iii With-pro ts results represents the shareholders transfer from the with-pro ts fund in the period : iv Insurance margin primarily represents pro ts derived from the insurance risks of mortality, morbidity and persistency : v Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses : vi Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the period attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs which are not included in the segment pro t for insurance as well as items that are more appropriately included in other source of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted against investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate : and vii DAC adjustments comprises DAC amortisation for the period, excluding amounts related to short-term uctuations, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.

ii DAC adjustments have been adjusted for the retrospective application of the accounting policy change described in note A5 of the IFRS fi financial statements.
iii Margin represents the operating return earned in the year as a proportion of the relevant class of policyholder liabilities excluding unallocated surplus.
iv For UK and Asia, opening and closing policyholder liabilities have been used to derive an average balance for the year, as this is seen as a good proxy for average balances throughout the year.
The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is derived from month-end balances throughout the year as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
Liabilities held in the general account for variable annuity living and death guaranteed benefi ts together with other amounts on which no spread income is earned eg REALIC liabilities are excluded from the calculation of the average.
In addition for REALIC, which are included in the average liability to calculate the administration expense margin, the calculation excludes the liabilities reinsured to and in essence retained by Swiss Re immediately prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
Analysis of Asia IFRS operating profi t drivers A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Spread income has increased by 18 million from 88 million in 2011 to 106 million in 2012, an increase of 20 per cent that predominantly re ects the growth of the Asian non-linked policyholder liabilities.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Fee income has increased from 131 million in 2011 to 141 million in 2012, broadly in line with the increase in movement in average unit-linked liabilities, following the recovery in equity markets in 2012.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Insurance margin has increased by 117 million from 477 million in 2011 to 594 million in 2012 predominantly re ecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
Insurance margin includes non-recurring items of 48 million 2011: 38 million, re ecting assumption changes and other items that are not expected to reoccur in the future.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Margin on revenues has increased by 254 million from 1,199 million in 2011 to 1,453 million in 2012 primarily re ecting the on-going growth in the size of the portfolio and higher premium income recognised in the year.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Acquisition costs have increased by 18 per cent from 766 million in 2011 to 903 million in 2012, compared to the 14 per cent increase in sales, resulting in a marginal increase in the acquisition cost ratio.
The analysis above has been prepared applying shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE.
If with-pro ts sales were excluded from the denominator the acquisition cost ratio would become 63 per cent 2011: 59 per cent re ecting changes to product and country mix.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Administration expenses have increased from 503 million in 2011 to 583 million in 2012 as the business continues to expand.
Expressed as a ratio of policyholder liabilities, administration costs have increased from 280 basis points to 295 basis points due to changes in business mix.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Expected return on shareholder assets has increased from 26 million in 2011 to 43 million in 2012 primarily due to higher income from increased shareholder assets.

iii The calculation of average liabilities for Jackson is derived from month-end balances throughout the year as opposed to opening and closing balances only.
In addition for REALIC, which is included in the average liability to calculate the administration expense margin, the calculation excludes the liabilities reinsured to and in essence retained by Swiss Re immediately prior to the acquisition by Jackson.
The 2010 balances have been amended for consistency albeit impacts are minimal.
Analysis of US operating profi t drivers A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Spread income was 702 million in 2012, down 28 million from the 730 million earned in 2011.
2012 bene ted by 156 million from the effect of transactions entered into during 2011 and 2010 to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration 2011: 113 million.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 186 basis points 2011: 218 basis points.
The reported spread margin decreased as a result of downward pressure on yields caused by the low interest rate environment, the effect of which was only partly mitigated by reductions in crediting rates.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Fee income has increased by 29 per cent to 875 million in 2012, compared to 680 million in 2011 as a result of the growth in separate account balances primarily due to positive net ows from variable annuity business.
Fee income margin has increased slightly to 199 basis points 2011: 197 basis points primarily re ecting changes to business mix.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Insurance margin represents operating pro ts from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Positive net ows into variable annuity business with life contingent and other guarantee fees, coupled with the bene t in the period of repricing actions, have increased the insurance margin from 232 million in 2011 to 399 million in 2012.
This includes the bene ts of four months pro ts amounting to 87 million from the life business of REALIC, following its acquisition by Jackson in September 2012.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Acquisition costs, which are commissions and general expenses incurred to acquire new business, have increased in absolute terms compared to 2011 due largely to an increase in sales volumes.
However, acquisition costs as a percentage of APE have decreased to 66 per cent for 2012, compared to 70 per cent in 2011, due to the continued increase in producers selecting asset based commission which is treated as an administrative expense in this analysis, rather than front end commissions.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Administration expenses increased to 537 million in 2012 compared to 412 million in 2011, primarily as a result of higher asset based commissions paid on the larger 2012 separate account balance.
Asset based commissions are paid upon policy anniversary dates and are treated as an administration expense in this analysis as opposed to a cost of acquisition and are offset by higher fee income.
The administration expense margin was higher at 71 basis points 2011: 66 basis points.
Excluding these trail commission amounts, the resulting administration expense margin would be 48 basis points 2011: 46 basis points.
The increase arises as a result of the effect of the REALIC acquisition on the administration expense margin together with the impact in 2012 of nonrecurring expenditures.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A DAC adjustments increased to 442 million in 2012 compared to 228 in 2011.
2011 was lowered by 190 million of accelerated DAC amortisation as a result of the reversal of the bene t received in 2008 from the mean reversion formula.
Market movements in 2012 resulted in deceleration of DAC amortisation of 56 million which was offset by higher amortisation as a result of higher gross pro ts.
Following the adoption of the updated US GAAP principles for deferred acquisition costs, as described in note A5 of the IFRS financial statements, certain acquisition costs are no longer fully deferrable resulting in new business strain of 174 million for 2012 2011: 156 million.

Analysis of UK IFRS operating profi t drivers A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Spread income has increased from 247 million in 2011 to 266 million in 2012 principally due to increased new business pro ts from higher annuity sales.
The margin has fallen slightly from 105 basis points to 102 basis points.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Fee income has increased in line with the growth in unit-linked liabilities.
Expressed as an asset management charge it is equivalent to 28 basis points 2011: 27 basis points.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A With-pro ts income has decreased by 21 million from 293 million in 2011 to 272 million in 2012 principally due to a 50 basis point reduction in annual bonus rates.
This has contributed to the reduction in the with-pro ts margin from 36 basis points in 2011 to 33 basis points in 2012.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Insurance margin has increased by 12 million from 27 million in 2011 to 39 million in 2012, mainly due to increased pro ts from our protection business.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Margin on revenues represents premiums charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A A Acquisition costs as a percentage of new business sales have improved from 17 per cent in 2011 to 15 per cent in 2012.
The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is therefore impacted by the level of with-pro t sales in the year.

The improvement is driven by a shift in overall sales mix to lower strain products and countries.
The strain refl ects the aggregate of the pre-tax regulatory basis strain to net worth aft er IFRS adjustments for deferral of acquisition costs and deferred income where appropriate.

Although a small amount less than 2 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash ows emerging in the years shown in the tables is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash ows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2012, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2012 over the same 40 year period.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging aft er 2052.
The above amounts can be reconciled to the new business amounts as follows: 2012 m New business Asia US UK Total Undiscounted expected free surplus generation for years 2013 to 2052 2,709 1,406 622 4,737 Less: discount effect 1,499 406 348 2,253 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2013 to 2052 1,210 1,000 274 2,484 Discounted expected free surplus generation for years 2052 41 3 44 Less: free surplus investment in new business 292 281 45 618 Other items 23 151 9 119 Post-tax EEV new business pro t 982 568 241 1,791 Tax 284 305 72 661 Pre-tax EEV new business profi t 1,266 873 313 2,452 Other items represent the impact of the time value of options and guarantees on new business, foreign exchange eff ects and other non-modelled items.
Foreign exchange eff ects arise as EEV new business profi t amounts are translated at average exchange rates and the expected free surplus generation uses year end closing rates.

Includes an adjustment of 102 million to the cash fl ows for which there is no defi nitive timeframe for their emergence and therefore which have been removed from the cash fl ows presented at 31 December 2012.
At 31 December 2012, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years years 2013 to 2017 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as underpin our embedded value reporting was 8.9 billion, an increase of 1.3 billion from the 7.6 billion expected over the same period at the end of 2011.
This increase primarily re ects the new business written in 2012, which is expected to generate 1,318 million of free surplus over the next five years.
Operating movements contributed positive 99 million.
The acquisition of REALIC contributed positive expected cash ows of 203 million over the next five years.
Non-operating and other items, including foreign exchange movements, reduced expected free surplus generation for the next five years by 326 million.
At 31 December 2012, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 35 billion, up from the 34 billion expected at end of 2011.
This is after allowing for adverse market movements in the period, with a 0.8 billion reduction due to foreign exchange and negative market movements in Asia as a result of lower fund earned rates.
A signi cant proportion of these market movements arise in Hong Kong re ecting both the projected derisking of the asset portfolio for participating business and lower local government bond yields fall of 90 basis points and Singapore where government bond yields have fallen by 30 basis points.
The overall growth in the undiscounted value of free surplus, notwithstanding these impacts, re ects both our ability to write new business on attractive economics and to manage the in-force book for value.
Actual underlying free surplus generated in 2012 from life business in-force at the end of 2011 was 2.3 billion inclusive of 0.3 billion of changes in operating assumptions and experience variances.
This compares with the expected 2012 realisation at the end of 2011 of 1.8 million.
