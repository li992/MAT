FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Parent Company 105 Oxford Instruments plc Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial Statements A ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys Financial Statements, except as noted below.
Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK GAAP accounting standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
In accordance with s408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
In accordance with FRS 1: Cash ow statements, the company is exempt from preparing its own cash ow statement.
Going concern The Financial Statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, based on the Directors opinion, after making reasonable enquiries, that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the Balance Sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the valuation or the cost less estimated residual value of tangible xed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Computer equipment 4 years Motor vehicles 4 years Financial instruments The Companys accounting policies for financial instruments under UK GAAP, namely FRS 25 Financial instruments: presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: measurement and FRS 29 Financial instruments: disclosures, are the same as the Groups accounting policies under IFRS, namely IAS 32 Financial instruments: presentation, IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement and IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures.
These policies are set out in accounting policy E Financial instruments in the Group accounting policies.
As consolidated financial information has been disclosed under IFRS 7 in notes 16, 17 and 18 to the Group Financial Statements, the Parent Company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29. iiiLiiw The Company participates in a group wide pension scheme providing benets based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17: Retirement benets, accounts for the scheme as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
Refer to note J for the additional disclosures required by FRS 17.
Foreign currencies The Company enters into forward exchange contracts and options to mitigate the currency exposures that arise on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted into Sterling at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the Balance Sheet date or at the appropriate forward contract rates.
Exchange profits and losses arising from the above are dealt with in the profit and loss account.

In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the company are debited directly to equity.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment, where appropriate.
Share-based payments The share option programme allows employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of options granted after 7 November 2002 and those not yet vested as at 1 April 2005 is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to market conditions.
When options are granted to employees of subsidiaries of the Company, the fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense in the Financial Statements of the subsidiary undertaking together with the capital contribution received.
In the Financial Statements of the Company, the options granted are recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding increase in equity.
`i` iiii` i`iv` Dividends unpaid at the Balance Sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the Financial Statements.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
