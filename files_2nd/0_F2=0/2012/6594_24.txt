F A financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 1 Accounting policies and presentation The Group's significant accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements the statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed and adopted for use by the European Union.
These statements have been prepared under the historical cost method except where other measurement bases are required to be applied under IFRS as set out below.
These statements have been prepared using all standards and interpretations required for financial periods beginning 1 January 2012.
No standards or interpretations have been adopted before the required implementation date.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations There were no changes in standards or interpretations outlined in the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 reported as likely to have a material impact on the reporting of the Groups results, assets and liabilities in 2012.
The Group adopted all applicable amendments to standards with an effective date in 2012 with no material impact on its results, assets and liabilities.
Basis of consolidation The statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group and the Groups share of the results and equity of its joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the Company has control through the power to govern financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefit from their activities.
This power is accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the Groups results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
All business combinations are accounted for by the purchase method.
Assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value.
Intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Other non-controlling interests represent the portion of shareholders' earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their financial and operating policies.
In all cases voting rights are 50% or lower.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method.
The Groups share of equity includes goodwill arising on acquisition.
The Groups share of profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and joint ventures are eliminated.
Foreign currencies Subsidiaries and joint ventures account in the currency of their primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency which mainly influences sales and input costs.
Transactions are translated at exchange rates approximating to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material transactions when actual spot rate may be used where it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such transactional exchange differences are taken into account in determining profit before tax.
Material foreign currency movements arising on the translation of intra-group balances treated as part of the net investment in a subsidiary are recognised through equity.
Movements on other intra-group balances are recognised through the income statement.
The Groups presentational currency is sterling.
On consolidation, results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated to sterling at average exchange rates except in the case of material transactions when the actual spot rate is used where it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Such translational exchange differences are taken to equity.
Profits and losses on the realisation of currency net investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the retranslation of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Presentation of the income statement IFRS is not fully prescriptive as to the format of the income statement.
Line items and subtotals have been presented on the face of the income statement in addition to those required under IFRS.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of subsidiaries.
F B Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Presentation of the income statement continued Operating profit is profit before discontinued operations, taxation, finance costs and the share of post-tax earnings of joint ventures accounted for using the equity method.
In order to achieve consistency and comparability between reporting periods, operating profit is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading performance and individually significant charges and credits.
Such items arise because of their size or nature and comprise: the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review: asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events that are significant to any reportable segment: amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations: changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and material currency translation movements arising on intra-group funding: profits or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group views as capital rather than revenue in nature: profits or losses arising from business combinations including fair value adjustments to pre-combination shareholdings, changes in estimates of deferred and contingent consideration made after the provisional fair value period and material expenses and charges incurred on a business combination: and significant pension scheme curtailments.
The Groups post-tax share of joint venture earnings is shown as a separate component of profit before tax.
The Groups share of material restructuring and impairment charges, amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations and other net financing charges and their related taxation are separately identified, in the related note.
Net financing costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest receivable and other net financing charges.
Other net financing charges include the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations and the expected return on pension scheme assets and unwind of discounts on fair value amounts established on business combinations.
Revenue recognition Sales Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, may be at the point of despatch, acceptance by the customer or, in Aerospace, certification by the customer.
Sales of services under risk and revenue sharing partnerships are recognised by reference to the stage of completion based on services performed to date.
The assessment of the stage of completion is dependent on the nature of the contract, but will generally be based on: costs incurred to the extent these relate to services performed up to the reporting date: achievement of contractual milestones where appropriate: or flying hours or equivalent for long-term aftermarket arrangements.
Revenue from royalties is not significant.
Many businesses in Automotive and Land Systems recognise an element of revenue via a surcharge or similar raw material cost recovery mechanism.
The surcharge invoiced or credited is generally based on prior period movement in raw material price indices applied to current period deliveries.
Other cost recoveries are recorded according to the customer agreement.
In those instances where recovery of such increases is guaranteed, irrespective of the level of future deliveries, revenue is recognised, or due allowance made, in the same period as the cost movement takes place.
Other income Interest income is recognised using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend income is not significant.
Sales and other income is recognised in the income statement when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is reasonably assured.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Cost Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use and borrowings costs on qualifying assets.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at valuation on 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and therefore deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in progress.
In the case of all other categories of property, plant and equipment, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the course of the financial year from the date the asset is available for use.
GKN plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012.
F C 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Property, plant and equipment continued Depreciation continued Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Years Freehold buildings Up to 50 Steel powder production plant 18 General plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 6 to 15 Computers 3 to 5 Commercial vehicles and cars 4 to 5 Property, plant and equipment is reviewed at least annually for indications of impairment.
Impairments are charged to the income statement.
Similarly, where property, plant and equipment has been impaired and subsequent reviews demonstrate the recoverable value is in excess of the impaired value an impairment reversal is recorded.
The amount of the reversal cannot exceed the theoretical net book amount at the date of the reversal had the item not been impaired.
Impairment reversals are credited to the income statement against the same line item to which the impairment was previously charged.
Costs capitalised relating to leasehold properties are charged to the income statement in equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Finance leased assets are not significant.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are capitalised as cost on qualifying tangible and intangible fixed asset expenditure.
A qualifying asset is an asset or programme where the period of capitalisation is more than 12 months and the capital value is more than 25 million 2011: 10 million.
For general borrowings the capitalisation rate is the weighted average of the borrowing costs outstanding during the year.
For specific funding and borrowings the amount capitalised is the actual borrowing cost incurred less any investment income on the temporary investment of those borrowings.
There has been no material impact on the current or prior period financial statements as a result of changing the qualifying asset threshold to 25 million.
Financial assets and liabilities Financial liabilities are recorded in arrangements where payment, or similar transfers of financial resources, is unavoidable or guaranteed.
In respect of the Groups Pension partnership arrangement payments are subject to discretion and can, if certain conditions are met, be avoided.
In this instance, the arrangement is classified as a non-controlling interest.
Borrowings are measured initially at fair value which usually equates to proceeds received and includes transaction costs.
Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than 90 days maturity.
Other financial assets comprise investments with more than 90 days until maturity.
Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are reflected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered to be material.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign currency contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast transactions.
All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is taken to the income statement.
Where derivative financial instruments are designated as and are effective as cash flow hedges, any gain or loss on remeasurement is held in equity and recycled through the income statement when the designated item is transacted, unless related to the purchase of a business, when recycled against consideration.
Gains or losses on derivative financial instruments no longer designated as effective hedges are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are not closely related to the host contract.
Gains and losses arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
F D Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Goodwill Goodwill consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition related expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following reassessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the year in which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested at least annually for impairment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, determined as the higher of estimated discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount on a fair value less cost to sell basis, goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges.
Computer software Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its useful economic life which is in the range of 3-5 years.
Development costs and participation fees Where development expenditure results in a new or substantially improved product or process and it is probable that this expenditure will be recovered it is capitalised.
Cost comprises development expenditure and borrowing costs on qualifying assets or fair value on initial recognition when as a result of a business combination.
In addition, payments made to engine manufacturers for participation fees relating to risk and revenue sharing partnerships, are carried forward in intangible assets to the extent that they can be recovered from future sales.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
In Aerospace, amortisation is charged over the assets life up to a maximum of 15 years for all programmes other than risk and revenue sharing partnerships where a maximum life of 25 years is assumed, either on a straight line basis or, where sufficient contractual terms exist, a unit of production method is applied.
In Automotive amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the assets life up to a maximum of 7 years.
Capitalised development costs, including participation fees, are subject to annual impairment reviews with any resulting impairments charged to the income statement.
Research expenditure and development expenditure not qualifying for capitalisation is written off as incurred.
Assets acquired on business combinations non-operating intangible assets Non-operating intangible assets are intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, which arise from contractual or other legal rights and are not transferable or separable.
On initial recognition they are measured at fair value.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over their expected useful lives which are: Years Marketing related assets brands and trademarks 20-50 agreements not to compete Life of agreement Customer related assets order backlog Length of backlog other customer contracts and relationships 2-25 Technology based assets 5-25 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value with due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost is determined on a first in, first out or weighted average cost basis.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated selling costs and costs to complete.
Taxation Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income when the related tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary differences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements and its tax base.
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
F E 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Taxation continued Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint ventures.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of overseas branches and subsidiaries except to the extent that it is probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-employment benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with defined postemployment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit schemes through full recognition of the schemes surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet at the end of each year.
Actuarial gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income.
Current and past service costs, curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating profit.
Returns on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised in other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income statement represents the Groups contributions to the relevant schemes in the year in which they fall due.
Government refundable advances Government refundable advances are reported in Trade and other payables in the balance sheet.
Refundable advances include amounts advanced by Government, accrued interest and directly attributable costs.
Refundable advances are provided to the Group to part-finance expenditures on specific development programmes.
The advances are provided on a risk sharing basis, i. e. repayment levels are determined subject to the success of the related programme.
Interest is calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Share-based payments Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of nonmarket related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Provisions Provisions for onerous or loss making contracts, warranty exposures, environmental matters, restructuring, employee obligations and legal claims are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise lease termination penalties and employee termination payments.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Any increase in provisions due to discounting, only recorded where material, is recognised as interest expense.
Standards, revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet adopted The Group does not intend to adopt any standard, revision or amendment before the required implementation date.
The only material impact on the Groups assets, liabilities and results from a change in accounting policy in 2013 is expected to be from adoption of IAS 19, Employee benefits revised.
The impact on the Group will be as follows: a to immediately recognise all past service credits: b to replace interest cost on scheme liabilities and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability: and c to split scheme administration costs previously reflected in other net financing changes between those relating to management of plan assets to be presented within other comprehensive income and other administration costs to be presented in trading profit.
The expected impact: on net assets at 1 January 2012 is 8 million, on statutory profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 20 million and on management profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 4 million.
The impact of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements including amendment to IAS 27 and IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements including amendment to IAS 28 are being assessed with adoption expected after 1 January 2014.
All other revisions and amendments to standards and interpretations which have an implementation date in 2013 or 2014 are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's results, assets or liabilities.
F F Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Group's significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of acquired assets and liabilities - business combinations note 23, post-employment obligations including the valuation of the Pension partnership plan asset note 25, derivative and other financial instruments notes 4b and 20, taxation note 6 and impairment of non-current assets note 11.
Details of the principle estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.
2 Segmental analysis The Group's reportable segments have been determined based on reports reviewed by the Executive Committee led by the Chief Executive.
The operating activities of the Group are largely structured according to the markets served: automotive, aerospace and the land systems markets.
Automotive is managed according to product groups: driveline and powder metallurgy.
Reportable segments derive their sales from the manufacture of product and sale of service.
Revenue from inter segment trading and royalties is not significant.

Acquisition related charges in 2012 comprise: integration costs, 2 million and transaction professional fees, 6 million, offset by gains on commercial hedging contracts, 5 million.
During the year, GKN Driveline and GKN Land Systems exited their operations in Uruguay.
Closure costs of 2 million are offset by previous currency variations of 2 million reclassified from other reserves.
The Group income statement for the year ended 31 December 2012 includes a net 2 million credit in relation to additional recoveries from the Groups insurer in respect of the temporary plant closure in Gallatin during 2011.
The financial implication of this incident in 2011 was a net pre-tax charge of 19 million.
The 19 million, which was charged to trading profit, represented a gross cost of 34 million offset by recoveries from the Groups external insurer of 15 million.
The net 19 million charge attracted taxation relief of 4 million.
The impact on cash flows in the year ended 31 December 2011 from operating activities was a net outflow of 19 million.

Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this are given on page 32.
Significant judgements and estimates The Group operates in many jurisdictions and is subject to tax audits which are often complex and can take several years to conclude.
Therefore, the accrual for current tax includes provisions for uncertain tax positions which require estimates for each matter and the exercise of judgement in respect of the interpretation of tax laws and the likelihood of challenge to historic tax positions.
Where appropriate, estimates of interest and penalties are included in these provisions.
As amounts provided for in any year could differ from eventual tax liabilities, subsequent adjustments which have a material impact on the Group's tax rate and or cash tax payments may arise.
Tax payments comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and cash tax payments.
With regard to deferred tax, judgement is required for the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is based on expectations of future financial performance in particular legal entities or tax groups.

If these earnings were remitted in full, tax of 12 million 2011: 13 million would be payable.
f Changes in UK tax rate A reduction in the mainstream rate of UK corporation tax to 24% took effect from April 2012 which gives rise to an effective UK tax rate of 24.5% for the year.
Further reductions to 21% by 2014 are expected and at the balance sheet date a reduction to 23% had been substantively enacted, so UK deferred tax is measured at 23%.
Further reductions will cause a corresponding reduction in the value of UK deferred tax assets.
g Franked investment income litigation Since 2003, the Group has been involved in litigation with HMRC in respect of various advance corporate tax payments made and corporate tax paid on certain foreign dividends which, in its view, were levied by HMRC in breach of the Groups EU community law rights.
A High Court judgment regarding payments on account was handed down in January 2013 confirming HMRC should repay payments on account to GKN.
The European Court of Justice published its decision on 13 November 2012 and the case will return to the UK Courts.
The continuing complexity of the case and uncertainty over the issues raised means that it is not possible to predict the final outcome of the litigation with any reasonable degree of certainty and, as a result, no contingent asset has been recognised.

A total of 108,247 in dividends was received by key management in 2012 2011: 106,700.
10 Share-based payments The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes.
Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
Awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
Details of awards made in 2012 are set out below.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 that impact the 2012 accounting charge are: a Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in August 2009, May 2010 and April 2011 under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a fixed exercise price based on the average share price for the five dealing days immediately before the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share eps growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition was based on Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Release is subject to the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement for Directors and certain very senior employees.
No ESOS awards were granted during the period.
b Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made in August 2009, August 2010 and April 2011 to GKN plc Directors only subject to eps performance over a three year period.
There is no retest facility under the scheme.
Release is subject to Directors satisfying a personal shareholding requirement.
No LTIP awards were granted during the period.
On release, a cash amount will be paid equivalent to aggregate dividends per share paid in the period commencing 1 January in the performance period to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant.
c Profit Growth Incentive Plan PGIP Awards were made in August 2010 and April 2011 under the PGIP to certain senior employees excluding Directors.
Any benefit under the PGIP will be delivered dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a three year performance period.
The PGIP is a cash-based incentive plan, however, for certain very senior employees the benefit is delivered in shares: the number of shares will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted profit growth is achieved.
A maximum of twice the amount of shares will be released on achievement of the maximum profit growth target, with one and a half times the number being released for medium performance.
No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the minimum profit growth target is not achieved.
Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement for certain very senior employees.
Any awards delivered under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust.
No PGIP awards were granted during the period.
d Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in April 2011 and August 2012.
Awards are in respect of above target performance under the short term variable remuneration scheme which are compulsorily deferred into shares under the DBP.
Awards are not subject to a further performance condition and shares will normally be released at the end of a two year deferral period.
On release, a cash amount will be paid equivalent to aggregate dividends per share paid during the deferral period.
Details of awards granted during the year are set out below: Weighted average Shares granted fair value at during period measurement date 2012 DBP awards 625,105 212.18p The fair value of shares awarded under the DBP is calculated as the share price on the grant date.
101 10 Share-based payments continued e Sustainable Earnings Plan SEP Awards comprising a Core Award and a Sustainability Award were made to Directors and certain senior employees in August 2012.
A Core Award is subject to eps growth targets over an initial three year performance period and a Sustainability Award is subject to the highest level of eps achieved over the initial three year period being sustained for a further two year period.
Sustained eps growth is measured independently in years four and five.
50% of the Core Award will be released at the end of the initial three year period: the balance of the Core Award together with the Sustainability Award will be released at the end of year five.
There is no provision for retesting performance for either the Core Award or Sustainability Award.
On release, dividends are treated as having accrued on the shares from the date of grant to the date of release with the value delivered in either shares or cash.
Details of SEP awards both a Core Award and a Sustainability Award granted during the year are set out below: Weighted average Shares granted fair value at during period measurement date 2012 SEP awards 10,318,028 214.00p The fair value of shares awarded under the SEP is calculated as the share price on the grant date.

Following the acquisition of Volvo Aerospace in the year there are other intangible assets of 320 million in respect of four programmes with a remaining amortisation period of 25 years.
As a result of a further acquisition in the year see note 23 for details and the increased value of assets arising on business combination, further analysis has been provided for each sub-category.
Comparative information has been enhanced for consistency.
There has been no change to the total for assets arising on business combinations in the comparative period.
c Impairment testing An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill including amounts arising on the business acquired in the year was tested for impairment with no impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, a CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best estimate of future performance.
In the case of an individual CGU within the Groups Aerospace Engine Products business, value in use at 31 December 2012 was measured using operating cash flow projections covering the next ten years which incorporate the anticipated timing of volumes on current programmes.
Management consider forecasting over this period to more appropriately reflect the length of business cycle of that CGUs programmes, in particular the growth of certain military programmes.
Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates In determining the recoverable amount of all CGUs it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash flows.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information.
Operating cash flows The main assumptions within forecast operating cash flow include the achievement of future sales prices and volumes including reference to specific customer relationships, product lines and the use of industry relevant external forecasts of global vehicle production within Driveline businesses and consideration of specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes within Aerospace, raw material input costs, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements, the impact of foreign currency rates upon selling price and cost relationships and the levels of ongoing capital expenditure required to support forecast production.
10B Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 11 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Impairment testing continued Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates Pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates are derived from risk-free rates based upon long term government bonds in the territory, or territories, within which each CGU operates.
A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to risk-free rates to reflect the risk inherent in each CGU relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
The range of pre-tax risk adjusted discount rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of geographical territories within CGUs within the reportable segments.
Driveline: North and South America 13%-24% 2011: 13%-24%, Europe 12%-14% 2011: 12%-14% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 10%-17% 2011: 10%-17% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 12% 2011: 12% and North America 13% 2011: 13% Aerospace: Europe 11% 2011: 11% and North America 12% 2011: 12% Land Systems: Europe 11%-14% 2011: 12% and North America 13% 2011: 13% Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the detailed cash flows into perpetuity, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published International Monetary Fund average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of nominal growth rates: Driveline: North and South America 3%-8% 2011: 3%-8%, Europe 2%-7% 2011: 3%-7% and Japan and Asia Pacific region countries 2%-8% 2011: 2%-8% Powder Metallurgy: Europe 4% 2011: 4% and North America 3% 2011: 3% Aerospace: Europe 3% 2011: 3% and North America 3% 2011: 3% Land Systems: Europe 2%-4% 2011: 2%-3% and North America 3% 2011: 3% Goodwill sensitivity analysis The results of the Groups impairment tests are dependent upon estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in relation to the key assumptions described above.
Sensitivity analysis to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore been reviewed.
At 31 December 2012, the date of the Group's annual impairment test, the estimated recoverable amount of one individual CGU within the Groups Aerospace operations, one CGU within the Groups Driveline operations and one CGU within the Groups Land Systems operations exceeded their carrying value by 131 million, 480 million and 25 million respectively.
The table below shows the discount rate, long term growth rate and forecast operating cash flow assumptions used in the calculation of value in use and the amount by which each assumption must change in isolation in order for the estimated recoverable amount to equal the carrying value.

Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
19 Financial risk management The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign currency risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the effects of financial risk on financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign currency contracts, are used to hedge risk exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Further information is provided in the treasury management section of the business review.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign currency risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a monthly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign currency policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons using forward foreign currency contracts.
As a result of the Volvo Aerospace acquisition on 1 October 2012, specific transactional hedge arrangements have been taken out against future payroll costs to fix the US$ functional currency amounts.
The Groups reporting currency for its consolidated financial statements is sterling.
Changes in exchange rates will affect the translation of results and net assets of operations outside of the UK.
The Group's largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 1 million and 2 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments a 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated below would have the following impact on operating profit: Trading profit: Payables Derivative and financial Intra-group receivables instruments funding m m m Euro 0.3 2.7 1.0 US dollar 0.6 18.2 0.2 The derivative sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant.
The sensitivity is a fair value change relating to derivatives for which the underlying transaction has not occurred at 31 December 2012.
The Group intends to hold all such derivatives to maturity.
The analysis of other items has been prepared based on an analysis of a currency balance sheet.

The Group's policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Group's cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Group's normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 50% to 80% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
At 31 December 2012 82% 2011: 87% of the Group's gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2012 4 million 2011: 6 million was in bank deposits, all of which was on deposit with banks on the Isle of Man 2011: 6 million.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits, facilities and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational As Tier 1 suppliers to automotive, land systems and aerospace original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Group's results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In Land Systems there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance are reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customer's ability to pay and other factors in the Group's relationship with the customer.
At 31 December the largest 5 trade receivables as a proportion of total trade receivables analysed by major segment is as follows: 2012 2011 % % Driveline CD 53 Powder Metallurgy 1G 20 Aerospace DG 67 Land Systems 2C 28 The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 1,055 million 2011: 940 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least Aor equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 4 million 2011: 6 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2012 to a single bank was 11 million 2011: 1 million.
112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 19 Financial risk management continued d Capital risk management The Group defines capital as total equity.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors borrowings on the basis of the ratio of gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at a gross debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries ratio of 3 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2012 and 2011 were as follows: 2012 2011 m m Gross borrowings 1,0C2 694 EBITDA EBA 621 Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 1.
B times 1.1 times The Groups two external banking covenants require an EBITDA of subsidiaries to net interest payable and receivable ratio of 3.5 times or more and net debt to EBITDA of subsidiaries of 3 times or less measured at 30 June and 31 December.

e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Group's policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities total 917 million of which 20 million expires in 2013, 592 million expires in 2016 and 225 million in 2017.
In addition the Groups European Investment Bank unsecured facility 80 million is repayable in five equal instalments of 16 million commencing in June 2015.
There were 157 million of drawings on these facilities at 31 December 2012.
Committed facilities are provided through 19 banks.
The Group also maintains 56 million of uncommitted facilities, provided by 3 banks.
There were drawings of 53 million against these facilities at 31 December 2012.

f Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial results.
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

The Group adopted transactional foreign currency hedge accounting for a limited number of foreign currency contracts.
The cash flows and related currency hedges to which hedge accounting applied all occurred before the end of 2012.
In order to mitigate exposure to foreign currency risk on the consideration payment for acquisition of Volvo Aerospace see note 23, the Group entered into forward currency contracts to fix the sterling value of the SEK denominated equity consideration.
Hedge accounting was applied which resulted in the gain of 13 million being taken to the Hedging Reserve.
On settlement of consideration on 1 October 2012, the 13 million gain was recycled into the purchase price used for calculating goodwill.
Significant judgement and estimates Forward foreign currency contracts, commodity contracts and embedded derivatives are marked to market using market observable rates and published prices together with forecast cash flow information where applicable.
The amounts in respect of embedded derivatives represent commercial contracts denominated in US dollars between European Aerospace subsidiaries and customers outside the USA.

Contract provisions The Group has a small number of onerous contracts and a non-beneficial lease arrangement, primarily arising on business combinations.
Onerous contracts relate to customer programmes where the unavoidable costs of delivering product are in excess of contracted sales prices.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 5 million in 2014 and 69 million from 2015.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 7 million in 2014 and 11 million from 2015.
11C 21 Provisions continued Claims and litigation Claims provisions are held in the Groups captive insurance company and amount to 6 million 2011: 14 million.
Claims provisions and charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice.
Legal provisions amounting to 5 million 2011: 4 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business.
Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Group's stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts of 11 million 2011: 5 million have been provided.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is estimated as 4 million in 2014 and 11 million from 2015.
Employee obligations Long service non-pension and other employee related obligations arising primarily in the Groups continental European subsidiaries amount to 23 million 2011: 19 million.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is expected as follows: 4 million in 2014: 3 million in 2015: 2 million in 2016 and 10 million from 2017.
Other Other provisions include 6 million in relation to previous reorganisation arising from the Groups strategic restructuring programmes 2011: 10 million and 7 million on acquisition of Volvo Aerospace relating to customer and supplier exposures.
Utilisation of the provision due in more than one year is expected as follows: 2 million in 2014 and 7 million from 2015.

11D Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 23 Business combinations Acquisition of Volvo Aerospace GKN Aerospace acquired the aero engine components businesses from AB Volvo on 1 October 2012.
The Group acquired 100% of the equity.
The entities acquired are together referred to as Volvo Aerospace or GKN Engine Systems.
Volvo Aerospace designs, engineers and manufactures components and sub-assemblies for aircraft engine turbines.
Volvo Aerospace employs some 3,000 people based in Sweden, Norway and the US.
The enlarged GKN Aerospace is a world leader in both aero structures and aero engine components.
Within aero engines, the Groups composite leadership and now strong metallic technology provides a unique offering to customers who are focused on lightweight, high performance engine solutions.
The following amounts represent a provisional determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
Final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the one year measurement period as required by IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
The size and complexity of the Volvo Aerospace acquisition will necessitate the use of this measurement period to further analyse and assess a number of the factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date including: significant contractual and operational factors underlying the customer related intangible assets, final negotiation of the purchase price, the assumptions underpinning certain provisions such as those for the loss making contracts and the related tax impacts of any changes made.
Any potential adjustments could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented below: m Intangible assets arising on business combinations customer related 236 technology based 97 Operating intangible assets development costs 96 participation fees 133 Property, plant and equipment 191 Cash 30 Inventories 242 Trade and other receivables 115 Trade and other payables 339 Government refundable advances 43 Post-employment obligations 67 Provisions 64 Deferred tax 127 Provisional goodwill 38 538 Satisfied by: Cash and cash equivalents 476 Deferred consideration 62 Fair value of consideration 538 From the date of acquisition to the balance sheet date, Volvo Aerospace contributed 191 million to sales and 15 million to trading profit excluding acquisition related charges of 3 million and restructuring costs of 19 million.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2012 the Groups statutory sales and trading profit for the year ended 31 December 2012 are estimated at 6,996 million and 579 million respectively.
Acquisition related charges of 3 million and a restructuring charge of 22 million have been recorded in the income statement within trading profit see note 2 for details.
Goodwill which is not tax deductible is attributable to the value of the assembled workforce and expected future sales synergies from combination with the Groups existing Aerospace business.
Prior year acquisitions During the year the Group made a claim under an indemnity clause, relating to the purchase of Stromag Holding GmbH in 2011.
The total claim of 4 million was in excess of the indemnity asset recorded 3 million so the residual 1 million has been recorded in the income statement within trading profit.
11E 23 Business combinations continued Significant judgements, assumptions and estimates in the acquisition accounting for Volvo Aerospace Valuation of intangible assets methodology The fair value exercise was carried out in conjunction with third party experts and considered the existence of the intangible assets relevant and attributable to the business.
The intangible assets inherent in Volvo Aerospaces customer relationships contracts were valued using an excess earnings method.
This methodology places a value on the asset as a function of a managements estimate of the expected cash flows arising from the customer contracts: b discount rates reflective of the risks inherent in the cash flows: and c a contributory charge attributable to assets needed to generate the operating cash flows.
An after tax discount rate of 10.0% to 11.0% was applied to the forecast cash flows.
The proprietary technology and know-how has been valued using a relief from royalty methodology.
The cash flow forecasts supporting this valuation reflect the future sales to be generated in conjunction with the technology.
The fair value attributed to proprietary technology represents the theoretical costs avoided by Volvo Aerospace from not having to pay a licence fee for the technology.
The royalty rate used in the valuation was 3%, based on a review of licence agreements for comparable technologies in a similar segment.
An after tax discount rate of 10.5% was applied to the forecast cash flows, a rate that reflects the inherent risk within cash flows and is comparable with the weighted average cost of capital for the acquisition.
The valuation of all intangible assets reflects the tax benefit of amortisation, which has meant a benefit assessed with reference to Sweden, Norway and the US tax laws.
According to US tax law an intangible asset may be rateably amortised over 15 years regardless of its actual useful life, in Sweden the amortisation period is 5 years and in Norway the amortisation period is 25 years.
As such, there is a tax benefit to an acquirer and hence values attributable to the intangible assets have been recognised.
This value amounts to 124 million across all the intangibles recognised.
In order to attribute value to pre-existing development costs and participation fees an impairment exercise under IAS 36 was performed based on acquisition date information.
The value recognised for operating intangible assets together with the value recognised for customer related intangible assets arising on business combinations is supported by underlying contract valuations prepared under IFRS 3.
Valuation of other assets and liabilities methodology Fair value adjustments on tangible fixed assets represent a net uplift on property, plant and equipment to fair values following external third party appraisal.
The uplift primarily represents the restoration of asset values fully depreciated and the current market conditions.
Inventories acquired were assessed for scrap and obsolete items before being fair valued.
Inventories acquired have been valued at current replacement cost for raw materials and selling price, adjusted for costs of completion and disposal and associated margin, for finished goods and work-in-progress.
The fair value of the inventory uplift was 37 million.
Liabilities include an amount in respect of onerous contracts and government refundable advances.
At acquisition there were forecast unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under long term agreements which exceed the contractual economic inflow they will generate.
Accordingly an additional onerous contract liability of 29 million has been recognised using a risk adjusted pre-tax discount rate of 12%.
Unavoidable costs include direct labour, material and specific engineering costs in addition to the net cost of purchasing fixed assets dedicated to the contract.
A liability of 43 million is included on the acquisition balance sheet for a contractual requirement to repay refundable advances provided by the Swedish Government under a risk sharing arrangement.
The liability has been valued based on forecast cash flows and the effective interest rate methodology.
Volvo Aerospace has been determined to have a US$ functional currency, which has been used in establishing the opening balance sheet and impacts post-acquisition earnings.

The Group now owns 100% of the equity share capital of this company.
Cash outflow in respect of previous restructuring plans was 4 million 2011: 31 million.
Proceeds from sale of fixed assets, put out of use as part of previous restructuring programmes, of nil were recognised in the year 2011: 2 million.

The main externally funded defined benefit pension schemes operate in the UK, US and Japan.
During the year, the UK defined benefit pension scheme was split into two separate schemes referred to as GKN1 and GKN2 below, each with different characteristics.
In Europe, funds are retained within certain businesses to provide defined benefit pension benefits.
In addition, in the US and UK a number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benefits.
As part of the Volvo Aerospace acquisition see note 23 and note d below certain pension assets and liabilities were acquired by the Group.
Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2012.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.

However, following the separation of the UK Pension scheme and for further consistency between the term of the bond yields used to determine the discount rate and the estimated term of the pension obligations around 12 years for GKN1 and around 17 years for GKN2, a term specific discount rate has been adopted for each UK scheme in 2012.
This has been derived from the Mercer pension discount yield curve, which is based on corporate bonds with two or more AA ratings.
The European discount rate of 2.7% was calculated with reference to the yield as at 31 December 2012 on the index of iBoxx Euro Corporate rated AA bonds with a maturity of 10 years plus, adjusted to reflect the duration of liabilities.
For the USA, the discount rate referenced the Citigroup pension liability index, the Merrill Lynch US corporate AA 15 years index and the Towers Watson rate:LINK benchmark as at 31 December 2012 4.05, 4.04 and 4.07 respectively.
There was no change in approach to European and US discount rate calculations.
The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes, consistent with the prior year, are as follows: United Kingdom Data on the UK schemes mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually.
The key current year mortality assumptions for both GKN1 and GKN2 use S1NA year of birth mortality tables allowing for medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% and adjustments of 0.7 and 1.3 years for male female members of GKN1 and 0.1 and 0.4 years for male female members of GKN2.
These assumptions give the following expectations for each scheme: for GKN1 a male aged 65 lives for a further 21.3 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 24.0 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.2 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 25.9 years from age 65.
For GKN2 a male aged 65 lives for a further 21.8 years and a female aged 65 lives for a further 24.8 years whilst a male aged 45 is expected to live a further 23.7 years from age 65 and a female aged 45 is expected to live a further 26.7 years from age 65.
120 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Continued 25 Post-employment obligations continued a Defined benefit schemes significant judgements, assumptions and estimates continued Key assumptions: continued Overseas In the USA, PPA2012 tables have been used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables have again been used.
In the USA the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 19.2 years female 21.0 years whilst in Germany a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.6 years female 22.7 years.
The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 45 is that he also lives for a further 19.2 years once attaining 65 years female 21.0 years, with the German equivalent assumption for a male being 21.3 years female 25.2 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions on the defined benefit net obligations as at 31 December 2012 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW Income Income Income Income Liabilities statement Liabilities statement Liabilities statement Liabilities statement m m m m m m m m Discount rate 1% 365 24.1 40 0.8 68 0.2 4 0.2 Discount rate -1% 457 22.8 50 1.2 88 0.5 4 0.2 Rate of inflation 1% 391 23.8 55 2.8 Rate of inflation -1% 295 21.3 46 2.3 Rate of increase in medical costs 1% 2 0.1 2 0.2 Rate of increase in medical costs -1% 2 0.1 2 0.2 Judgements and estimates Pension partnership interest On 31 March 2010 the Group agreed an asset-backed cash payment arrangement with the Trustee of the UK Pension scheme to help address the UK pension funding deficit.
In connection with the arrangement certain UK freehold properties and a non-exclusive licence over the GKN trade marks, together with associated rental and royalty rights, were transferred to a limited partnership established by the Group.
The partnership is controlled by and its results are consolidated by the Group.
The fair value of the assets transferred was 535 million.
On 31 March 2010, the Group made a special contribution to the UK Pension scheme of 331 million and on the same date the UK Pension scheme used this contribution to acquire a nominal limited interest in the partnership for its fair value of 331 million.
The UK Pension schemes nominal partnership interest entitles it to a distribution from the income of the partnership of 30 million per annum for 20 years subject to a discretion exercisable by the Group in certain circumstances.
At inception the discounted value of the cash distributions was assessed at 331 million which was recognised as a pension plan asset and as a non-controlling interest in equity.
In accordance with IAS 19 a plan asset has been recognised given that the UK pension schemes have unfettered rights to freely transfer or sell their interests in the arrangement to a third party.
Other factors relevant to recognition as a plan asset include the ability of third parties to value the asset, the income interest inherent in the arrangement is held by a legally separate entity, the asset is held solely to fund employee benefits, there are restrictions on its availability to the Groups creditors in a bankruptcy and restrictions exist on the assets return to the Group.
In accordance with IAS 32 the non-controlling interest in equity arises as there is an unconditional right to avoid making cash payments due to discretion provisions which form part of the agreement.
A distribution of 30 million for the year to 31 December 2011 was made in the second quarter of 2012 2011: 23 million.
The Pension partnership interest has been valued on a discounted cash flow basis.
The valuation is carried out on an arms length basis from a market participants perspective.
This considers factors relevant to the risk assessments that are specific to the arrangement structure and would reasonably be considered by a market participant should they have the opportunity to participate in the arrangement.
The valuation considered separately the profiles of the originating royalty and rental income streams using the Groups current budget and forecast data with other factors considered being related expenses including taxation, timing of the distributions, exchange rates, bond yields and the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to assess the valuation impact of various scenarios attributable to potential value and risk assessments that a reasonable market participant could consider.

12C 25 Post-employment obligations continued c Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes outside the United Kingdom.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 21 million 2011: 15 million.
d Changes to Group post-employment obligations arrangements St Louis On 1 April 2012 the Group transferred the assets and liabilities of its defined benefit pension scheme of the hourly paid workers at GKN Aerospaces St Louis facility to the International Association of Mechanists and Aerospace Workers IAM National Pension Fund.
At this date the IAM National Pension Fund had over 1,750 participating employers with over 5 billion of investment assets under management and as at 31 December 2011 it was in a net surplus position.
From 1 April 2012 the members associated with this pension scheme are part of a multiemployer pension arrangement and as the total assets are not capable of separate determination the Group will account for its future obligations as if it were part of a defined contribution scheme.
The post-employment obligation was actuarially assessed at 31 March 2012 and the current service cost, other pension financing charge, actuarial gains and losses and contributions were recorded to this date consistent with other defined benefit pension schemes in the Group.
At 31 March 2012, the scheme had an IAS 19 deficit of 55 million 31 December 2011: 68 million, which has subsequently been fiderecognised from the balance sheet.
The Group had a remaining obligation of 20 million at 31 March 2012 being the principal amount payable to the IAM National Pension Fund over 4 years.
An obligation of 21 million at 31 December 2012 is included in the Groups net post-employment obligation of 978 million.
The net pension scheme curtailment of 35 million has been recognised in the income statement, including related professional fees.
Volvo Aerospace In connection with the acquisition in the year of Volvo Aerospace, the Group took control of defined benefit pension arrangements, including assets of 91 million and defined benefit liabilities of 158 million, giving a net deficit of 67 million see note 23.
The majority of this deficit 64 million related to the Swedish ITP2 scheme and subsequent to the acquisition the Group entered into a fully insured buy-out arrangement with a third party insurer, Alecta, in relation to past service liabilities in the ITP2 scheme.
Under the terms of this arrangement, the Group made an incremental cash payment of 46 million, resulting in a net curtailment credit of 18 million recognised in the income statement.
Arrangements have been made for future service in relation to benefits accruing under the ITP2 scheme also to be fully insured as they arise, via monthly payments to the relevant third party insurer, such that the Group will account for its future obligations under this scheme as if it were part of a defined contribution scheme, for as long as the insurance based arrangement subsists.
In addition to the net curtailment gain a further credit of 10 million was realised on the settlement of associated payroll taxes.
This took the total pension scheme curtailment credit for the ITP2 arrangement to 28 million.
The aggregate of the IAM net pension scheme curtailment and that for the Swedish ITP2 scheme was 63 million 2011: nil.
26 Contingent assets and liabilities Aside from the unrecognised contingent asset referred to in note 6 in respect of Franked Investment Income, there were no other material contingent assets at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2012.
In the case of certain businesses performance bonds and customer finance obligations have been entered into in the normal course of business.
