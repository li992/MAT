The 4.6m of VAT refunded had previously been charged on income from gaming machines operated in the restaurants of the Group.
HMRC refunded the amount paid, plus accrued interest of 0.7m, on the basis of a ruling that VAT may not be applicable on certain types of gaming machine income.
HMRC continues to appeal the ruling, but the Group does not consider it probable that an appeal will be successful.
Accordingly no provision for repayment has been made although a contingent liability is disclosed in note 30.
During the year a net gain of 25.6m was recognised on disposals of property, plant and equipment, the majority of which relates to the sale and leaseback agreement for seven properties.
In addition, a provision has been raised in relation to the properties that reverted to Whitbread following difficulties with Southern Cross.
Furthermore a worsening of the property market has led to a further requirement of provision on the onerous contract portfolio.

The interest arising from the unwinding of the discount rate within provisions is included in exceptional interest, reflecting the exceptional nature of the provisions created.
