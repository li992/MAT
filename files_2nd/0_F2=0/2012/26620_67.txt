73 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 3.
Revenue and margins Management fees, which include all non-performance related fees and interest income from loans to fund products, are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered.
Performance fees are only recognised when they can be measured reliably.
Performance fees can only be measured reliably at the end of the performance period as the net asset value NAV of the fund products could move significantly, as a result of market movements, between Mans financial reporting period end and the end of the performance period.
The level of funds under management FUM drives the aggregate level of management fee revenue so in order to sustain a profitable business operating costs must be flexible with different levels of FUM.
