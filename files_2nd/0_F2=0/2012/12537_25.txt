The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and f have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050.
The increases under e are principally due to the additional pension accrued over the year.
The amounts under f represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
The following payments were made to a former director of the company in respect of unfunded pension liabilities: Amount of unfunded Amount of unfunded pension paid during 2012 pension paid during 2011 J A Heath 36,910 35,354
