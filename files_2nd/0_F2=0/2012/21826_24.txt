Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
General information Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is given on page 3.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report and Business Review.
The Company is registered in England and Wales.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have had no impact on these financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of Financial Statements Sever Hyperinflation and Removal of Fixed Dates for First-time adopters Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Transfer of Financial Assets Amendments to IAS 12 Income taxes Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective and yet to be endorsed by the EU are as follows: Amendments to IFRS 1 Repeated application of IFRS 1 and Borrowing Costs Amendment to IAS 1 Clarification of the requirements for comparative information IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities IFRS 13 Fair value measurement IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate financial statements IAS 28 revised 2011 Associates and joint ventures Amendment to IAS 12 Income taxes on deferred tax New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective and have been endorsed by the EU are as follows: IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements on OCI The Group is currently reviewing the impact of these new standards, amendments and interpretations but does not intend to adopt the standards early.
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 9s full impact.
IAS 19 revised 2011 will impact the measurement of the various components representing movements in the defined benefit pension obligation and associated disclosures, but not the Groups total obligation.
The amendments to IAS 19 revised 2011, if applied for the year ended 30 September 2012, would increase profit after tax by approximately 293,000 and increase actuarial losses in other comprehensive income by the same amount.
There would be no effect on total equity.
Basis of accounting The financial statements of both the Group and the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Going concern As discussed in the Business Review, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Accordingly they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
c. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings.
50 The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the date of acquisition.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
In the Companys accounts investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
In accordance with Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own statement of comprehensive income or income statement.
The amount of the profit for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in note 12 to the financial statements.
d. Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
"The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: t EFGFSSFE UBY BTTFUT PS MJBCJMJUJFT BOE MJBCJMJUJFT PS BTTFUT SFMBUFE UP FNQMPZFF CFOFGJU BSSBOHFNFOUT BSF SFDPHOJTFE BOE measured in accordance with lAS 12 Income Taxes and lAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: t MJBCJMJUJFT PS FRVJUZ JOTUSVNFOUT SFMBUFE UP UIF SFQMBDFNFOU CZ UIF SPVQ PG BO BDRVJSFF T TIBSF CBTFE QBZNFOU BXBSET BSF measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: and t BTTFUT PS EJTQPTBM HSPVQT UIBU BSF DMBTTJGJFE BT IFME GPS TBMF JO BDDPSEBODF XJUI '34 PO DVSSFOU ""TTFUT FME GPS 4BMF BOE Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard."
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
e. Transaction date accounting All securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients are recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction.
The underlying investments are not shown in the financial statements of the Group.
f. Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 51 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
g. Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents gross commission, investment management fees, renewal commissions and corporate advisory and broking retainers, other fees plus other income, excluding VAT, receivable in respect of the period.
Investment management fees, renewal commissions and corporate advisory and broking retainers are recognised in the period in which the related service is provided and investment management commissions are recognised when the transaction is performed.
Revenue for the Corporate and Advisory business which has been discontinued is included in the analysis for discontinued operations.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the income statement to the extent that they represent a realised profit and loss for the Company.
h. Operating profit Operating profit is stated as being profit before finance income, finance costs, other gains losses and tax.
Other operating income Interest receivable and payable on client free money balances is netted to calculate the Groups share of interest receivable and included under the heading Other operating income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and bank overdrafts.
k. Leases Annual rentals on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are recognised as a liability and are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l. Share-based payments Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
The fair value excludes the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equity-settled share-based transactions are set out in note 30.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions.
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.
52 m. Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
n. Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any in the entity over the net of the identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Elements of the total sum of the consideration of an acquisition may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the acquisition indicates the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date, potentially leading to adjustments in the income statement.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 t. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
ii Client relationships Intangible assets classified as client relationships are recognised when acquired as part of a business combination or when separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers.
Client relationships are initially recognised at cost and are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
If acquired as part of a business combination the initial cost of client relationships is the fair value at the acquisition date.
When separate payments are made to acquire funds under management by adding teams of investment managers, elements of the total consideration may be deferred or contingent.
In such cases the cost of the recognised client relationships includes the Companys best estimate of the future consideration likely to be made, discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and is revised at each balance sheet date.
Such deferred or contingent consideration may be settled in shares see note 3 t. Client relationships are amortised over seven to fifteen years, their minimum estimated useful lives.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 53 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued iii Computer software Computer software which is not an integral part of the related hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Costs of acquiring computer software are treated as an intangible asset and amortised over four years on a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use.
Computer software developed internally is separately identified and recognised as an intangible asset if it is part of a specifically authorised project which will give probable future economic benefits over a period of not less than four years, and is amortised over four years on a straight line basis from the date the software comes into use.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment.
Depreciation has been provided on the basis of equal annual instalments to write off the cost less estimated residual values of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Computer equipment 3 to 4 years Office equipment 4 to 10 years Leasehold improvements to first break clause of lease.
PUPS WFIJDMFT ZFBST The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
p. Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on trade date, where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, held to maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset is held-for-trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held-for-trading if it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporate any dividends or interest earned on the financial asset.
Their value is determined in the manner described in note 19.
Available-for-sale financial assets AFS Certain shares held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 19.
Gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses which are recognised directly in profit or loss.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the revaluation reserve is reclassified to profit or loss.
Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit and loss when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets.
54 For listed and unlisted equity investments classified as AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of the impairment.
When an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
In subsequent periods if the amount of impaired loss decreases, in respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised in profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised in other comprehensive income.
r. Netting of balances Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle on balance are shown net where there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and an operational intention to settle net.
Amounts due to and from counterparties due to settle against delivery of stock are shown gross.
s. Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
t. Shares to be issued including premium Shares to be issued represent the Companys best estimate of the amount of ordinary shares in the Company, which are likely to be issued following business combinations or the acquisition of client relationships which involve deferred payments in the Companys shares.
The sum is discounted to present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and is revised annually in the light of actual results.
The resulting interest charge from the unwind of the discount is included within finance costs.
Where shares are due to be issued within a year then the sum is included in current liabilities.
Where the team of investment managers, bringing with them funds under management, have not yet joined and the client relationships assets have not been brought into use, the resultant liability is shown as an amount contracted for but not provided in the accounts.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to thescheme.
v. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3.
Significant accounting policies continued For the purposes of impairment testing, client relationships and goodwill are allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Fair value is established by valuing clients funds under management in each of the cash-generating units based on the value of funds under management at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
If the carrying amount relating to any cash-generating unit exceeds the calculated fair value less costs to sell, a value in use is calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
w. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Where some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that the reimbursement will be received and the amount receivable can be measured reliably.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and profits and losses.
Evaluation of the accounting judgements takes into account historical experience as well as future expectations.
Retirement benefit obligation In conjunction with the Groups Actuary, the Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends, including life expectancy.
These estimates are governed by the rules set out in IAS 19 Employee Benefits which inevitably lead to significant swings in the pension deficit from year to year, as long term interest rates change and short term market movements affect asset valuations.
The detailed assumptions are set out in note 27.
Shares to be issued including premium and deferred purchase consideration The Group includes within these headings its best estimate discounted to present value of the ultimate sum which will be paid for businesses or client relationships under deferred purchase agreements.
This is inevitably judgemental and depends on events which transpire over periods up to five years.
Market conditions are an important factor.
Impairment of goodwill and client relationships For the purposes of impairment testing, the Group values goodwill and client relationships based on the valuation of individual units making up the relevant intangible asset.
For an investment management business this is normally based on the value of funds under management at the period end: the percentages of funds being used depending on values attributed in recent public transactions for the purchase of advisory and discretionary funds.
A price earnings basis is used where more appropriate.
Valuation of investment in Euroclear plc The fair valuation of the Groups investment in Euroclear plc is takes into account a number of different valuation methods including dividend yield.

Financial instruments and risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: t market risk: t credit risk: t liquidity risk: and t operational risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups policy and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors have overall responsibility for setting the Groups risk appetite and for establishing and overseeing the risk management framework to recognise the risks faced by the Group.
The Directors established a Board Risk Committee in October 2011 see Risk Committee Report.
The Board is advised by the Board Risk Committee in its considerations and processes in the areas such as: the risk appetite and business activities that expose the business to material risks.
Authority flows from the Board Risk Committee and then to the Risk Management Committee RMC and from there to specific committees which are integral to the management of risk.
The RMC identifies and reviews the principal risks of the Group and considers the areas of market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.
The Board Risk Committee has delegated responsibility to oversee how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Board Risk Committee reviews the assessment of controls that are in place to mitigate risk and the Risk Management and Principal Risks document bi-annually which is prepared by the RMC.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 73 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Brewin Dolphins risk management activities involve the measurement, evaluation, acceptance and management of some degree of risk, or combination of risks.
The Board has to date set a low risk appetite whilst recognising the inevitable risk of being exposed to adverse movements in the stock market.
In light of the changes that the Group is currently undertaking the Board Risk Committee, reconsidered the risk appetite which was subsequently approved by the Board in October 2012.
Brewin Dolphin is not willing to accept risk which has not been subject to evaluation by the appropriate risk governance forums.
When the BDH Board considers it necessary and under a clearly defined mandate, Brewin Dolphin will accept a modest risk appetite for the purposes of moving the business to a position of greater security in respect of regulatory, finance, operational or other risks and to undertake changes in the best interests of its clients.
The BDH Board recognise that under such circumstances a modest risk appetite may result in increased risk and so the BDH Board will only undertake such steps if they are clearly judged to be in the best interests of the Groups stakeholders.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns.
The capital structure of the Group and Company consists of issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group has an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA for establishing the amount of regulatory capital to be held by the Group.
There are two regulated entities in the Group: Brewin Dolphin Limited BDL regulated by the FSA and Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.
The ICAAP draws on the Groups Principal Risk Review which is based on bi-annual risk assessments.
It gives consideration to both current and projected financial and capital positions.
The ICAAP is updated throughout the year to take account of the bi-annual risk assessments and for any significant changes to business plans and any unexpected issues that may occur.
The ICAAP is discussed and approved at a Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Board meeting at least annually.
Capital adequacy is monitored daily by management.
The Group uses the simplified approach to Credit Risk to calculate Pillar 1 requirements.
The Group observed the FSAs regulatory requirements throughout the period.
The regulatory capital resources of the Group calculated in accordance with FSA definitions were as follows: 30 September 30 September 2012 2011 Tier 1 capital resources 000 000 Ordinary share capital 2,469 Share premium account 124,271 116,028 Own shares held 12,569 10,686 Retained earnings 21,331 19,970 Merger reserve 22,950 Shares to be issued 19,276 29,381 177,728 180,048 Deduction Intangible assets 120,930 56,798 64,243 Tier 2 capital resources Revaluation reserve 4,285 4,118 Deductions 4,285 4,118 Tier 1 plus tier 2 capital resources 61,083 68,361 Deduction Material holdings Total capital before deductions 61,083 68,361 Deductions from total capital 452 284 Total capital resources after deductions 60,631 68,077 There were no changes in the Groups approach for capital management during the period.

Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of the Groups market risk management is to both control and manage our exposure within the Groups risk appetite whilst accepting the inherent risk of market fluctuations.
The Group acts as an Investment Manager and agency stockbroker within the UK and Republic of Ireland, all trades are matched in the market.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
The total net foreign exchange exposure at the year end was a debtor of 421,000 2011: 13,000 creditor.
At the period end Tilman Brewin Dolphin Limited had net assets of 4.1m 2011: 3.4m denominated in their local currency Euros.
The Group does not hold any derivatives 2011: none.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during the period.
Equity price risk The Group is exposed to equity risk arising from its available-for-sale investments and those held-for-trading.
Equity investments designated as available-for-sale are held for strategic purposes rather than trading purposes and the Group does not actively trade in these investments.
Equity price sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to equity price risk at the reporting date.

The Groups sensitivity to equity prices has not changed significantly from the prior period.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the Groups cash and in respect of client deposits.
The latter arises because the interest rate paid to its clients on their deposits is linked to the base rate.

Financial instruments and risk management continued II.
Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a client or other counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arises principally from the settlement of client and market transactions and cash deposited at banks.
The Group uses the simplified approach to calculate credit risk as defined by the FSA.
The aim of the Groups approach to credit risk management is to minimise the risk as far as possible.
Exposure to credit risk is spread over a large number of counterparties and clients and with collateral held, in the main, in Group nominee companies which helps to mitigate credit risk.
The collateral held consists of equity and gilts quoted on recognised exchanges plus cash.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with the exception of cash where the majority is spread across three major banks.
The Group undertakes traded options as part of its service to clients: this is an insignificant part of the Groups business.
This business is transacted as principal as per the LIFFE rules, all such transactions are always on a matched basis, clients are required to pledge collateral if they hold option positions, which are monitored on a daily basis.
Maximum exposure The maximum exposure to credit risk at the end of the reporting period is equal to the balance sheet figure.
Credit exposure Credit exposure in relation to both client and market transactions is monitored daily.
The Groups exposure to large trades is limited with an average bargain size in the current period of 13,000: there are additional controls for high value trades.
Impaired assets The total gross amount of individually impaired assets in relation to trade receivables at the period end was 321,000 2011: 1,132,000.
Collateral valued at fair value by the Group in relation to these impaired assets was 120,000 2011: 112,000.
This collateral is stock held in the clients account which per our client terms and conditions can be sold to meet any unpaid liabilities falling due.
The net difference has been provided as a doubtful debt see note 20.
Note 20 also details amounts past due but notimpaired.
Credit quality Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired in respect of trade receivables relate mainly to bonds, equity and gilt trades quoted on a recognised exchange, are matched in the market, and are either traded on a cash against documents basis or against a clients portfolio in respect of which any one trade would normally be a small percentage of the clients collateral held in the Group nominee.
At the period end no financial assets that would otherwise be past due or impaired had been renegotiated 2011: none.

The credit risk on liquid funds, cash and cash equivalents is limited due to deposits being held at three major banks with minimum credit ratings of A, assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Deposits are managed by the Treasury Department and are reviewed regularly by the Management Committee.
The Group carries out at least an annual review of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to credit risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during theperiod.
Brewin Dolphin Holdings PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 77 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 26.
Financial instruments and risk management continued III.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk refers to the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains adequate cash resources to meet its financial obligations at all times.
All client cash deposits are repayable on demand.
At 30 4FQUFNCFS UIF SPVQ IBE BDDFTT UP BO PWFSESBGU GBDJMJUZ PG b NJMMJPO b NJMMJPO The Group has a Liquidity Policy which is reviewed by the Board annually.
As the Group normally deals with the market on a cash against document basis, liquidity risk is monitored by daily exception reports of unmatched items past settlement date and managed by the Treasury Department and Credit Control Department: reports are reviewed regularly by the Management Committee.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to liquidity risk or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk during theperiod.
The following are the undiscounted cash flows, with the exception of shares to be issued, of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
Financial instruments and risk management continued IV.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events, including legal risk.
The objective of the Groups approach to managing operational risk is to identify, assess and mitigate operational risk in a cost effective manner through the Operational Risk Framework and within the Groups risk appetite.
The Operational Risk Framework is supported by the three lines of defence model.
This model embeds risk management across the organisation as it distinguishes among functions owning and managing risks: functions overseeing risks: and functions providing independent assurance.
Thus each line of defence plays an important role in ensuring effective risk management.
Operational risks are monitored and reported to the relevant risk committees or boards.
The Group uses the results of its annual risk management and principal risk review process for Pillar 2 purposes.
Information disclosure under Pillar 3 of the Capital Requirements Directive will be published on the Groups website before 31December 2012 at www.
Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates a registered Defined Contribution Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Senior Staff Pension Fund and a registered Defined Benefit Scheme the Brewin Dolphin Limited RBS in the UK which both offer pensions in retirement and death benefits to members.
The disclosures provided are in respect of the Defined Benefit Scheme only.
Pension benefits are related to the members final salary at retirement and their length of service.
