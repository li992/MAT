85 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 15.
Investments in fund products and other investments continued Other investments in fund products expose Man to market risk and therefore the commitment process is subject to limits consistent with the Boards risk appetite.
The largest single investment in fund products was $46 million 31 December 2011: $36 million.
The market risk from other investments in fund products and other investments is modelled using a value at risk VaR methodology using a 95% confidence interval and one month time horizon.
The VaR is estimated to be $15 million at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: $16 million.
The total net gain on investments in fund products reported in the Income statement was $23 million nine months to December 2011: net losses of $6million.
Fund investment for deferred compensation arrangements At year end, investment in fund products included $51 million 31 December 2011: $40 million of Man and GLG fund products related to deferred compensation arrangements.
Employees are subject to mandatory deferral arrangements and as part of these arrangements employees can electdeferral into a designated series of Man fund products.
As the fund product plans are treated as variable plans for accounting purposes the compensation expense increases decreases based on the value of the designated fund products.
The fund product investments are held to offset this change in compensation during the vesting period and at vesting the fund investment is delivered to the employee.
The fund product investments are recorded at fair value with any unrealised gain loss during the vesting period charged to compensation expense in the Income statement.
Other investments Sale of Lehman claims On 16 November 2012, the Group entered into a series of transactions with Hutchinson Investors LLC, managed by the Baupost Group, to sell the residual exposure to the Lehman estates Lehman claims that it acquired in July 2011 from certain GLG managed funds.
The total consideration for the transactions was $456 million, and resulted in a gain on sale of $131 million Note 2.
Man may receive up to a further $5million if overall recoveries by the buyer exceed certain thresholds in the future.
The transaction allows Man to benefit from the payment of the total consideration, while providing guarantees of up to $75 million Note 28 to the funds for prompt payment by the Baupost Group of amounts owed to the funds in the event of a successful claim.
The proceeds increased Mans regulatory capital surplus and further enhanced its net cash position.
Fee and other receivables 31 December 31 December $m 2012 2011 Fee receivables 65 104 Prepayments and accrued income 179 132 Other receivables 138 192 382 428 Fee and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds NAV is determined.
