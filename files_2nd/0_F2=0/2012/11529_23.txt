Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective at the date of these Financial Statements are listed below.
Effective Date for periods beginning on or after IAS 19 Employee Benets Amendment 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements as revised in 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as revised in 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendment 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classication and Measurement 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2014 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2014 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities 1 January 2014 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments 1 January 2014 The Group has commenced a review of the impact to financial reporting from the changes to IFRS 10, 11 and 12.
The impact of the adoption of other standards noted above has not been assessed by the Group.
The Group plans to adopt the standards in line with the effective dates above.
COM 82 2.2Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and the entities it controls its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Basis of consolidation from 1 January 2010 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising therefrom, are eliminated.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it i derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary: ii derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest: iii derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity: iv recognises the fair value of the consideration received: v recognises the fair value of any investment retained: and vi recognises any surplus or deficit in profit and loss: vii reclassies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit and loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and is presented separately within the Consolidated statement of financial position, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
Basis of consolidation prior to 1 January 2010 Certain of the above-mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis.
The following differences, however, are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation: Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the Consolidated statement of financial position, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests were accounted for using the equity concept method.
Losses incurred by the Group were attributed to the minority interest until the balance was reduced to nil.
Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent, unless the non-controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover these.
2.3Summary of significant accounting policies a Exploration and evaluation expenditure The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for the exploration and evaluation E&E costs as permitted by IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
All costs incurred after the rights to explore an area have been obtained, such as licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and other direct costs of E&E are accumulated and capitalised as E&E assets, in well, eld or licence-specic exploration cost centres as appropriate pending determination.
Costs other than payments to acquire the legal right to explore incurred prior to acquiring rights to explore and general exploration costs not specic to any particular licence or prospect are charged directly to the income statement.
E&E assets are not amortised prior to the determination of the results of exploration activity.
At completion of evaluation activities, if technical and commercial feasibility is demonstrated, then, following recognition of commercial reserves, the carrying value of the relevant E&E asset will be reclassied as a development and production asset, subject to the carrying value of the relevant E&E asset being assessed for impairment.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 83 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued If, on completion of evaluation of prospects or licences, it is not possible to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability or if the legal right to explore expires or if the Group decides not to continue E&E activity, then the costs of such unsuccessful E&E are written off to the income statement in the period of that determination.
The carrying value of E&E assets is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Where this is indicated, management will assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset.
The review is based upon a status report detailing the Groups intention for development of the asset.
Where it cannot be recovered via successful development or sale, all costs are written off.
The Group may enter into farm-in or farm-out arrangements, where it may introduce partners to share in the development of an asset.
For transactions involving assets at the exploration and evaluation phase, the Group adopts an accounting policy as permitted by IFRS 6 such that the Group does not record any expenditure made on its behalf under a carried interest by a farm in partner.
Where applicable past costs are reimbursed, the value of the cash consideration is credited against costs previously incurred.
Farmed out oil and gas properties are accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.
b Intangibles Intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with nite lives are amortised over the useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
c Goodwill Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest NCI over the fair value of the identiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the identiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill forms part of a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation.
Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as at 31 December and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU or reportable segment is compared with its recoverable amount.
In determining whether goodwill is impaired the Group reviews the status of projects including recent farm-out transactions and whether the Groups intention is to further develop the Groups various assets.
d Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non-controlling interest NCI in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the acquirer elects to measure the components of NCI that are present ownership interests that entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entitys net assets in the event of liquidation either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees WWW.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classication and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
Those oil & gas reserves that are able to be reliably measured are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and rights, for which fair values cannot be reliably measured, are not recognised.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date being the date the acquirer gains control through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classied as equity, it is not remeasured until it is nally settled within equity.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, which comprises furniture and ttings and computer equipment, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment calculated using the straight line method at rates to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the statement of financial position date, of each asset over expected useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years.
f Investments in subsidiaries The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries of which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Such balances are considered to be part of the Companys net investment in its subsidiaries.
The carrying values of investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Cash and short term deposits Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of financial position comprise cash at banks and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, or deposits that are held for meeting short term cash requirements which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignicant risks of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents excludes any restricted cash which is not available for use by the Group and therefore is not considered highly liquid for example cash set aside to cover rehabilitation obligations.
For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash ows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Allowance is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Evidence on non-recoverability may include indications that the debtor or group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or default or delinquency in repayments.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.
They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obligated to make future payments in respect of the purchase of those goods and services.
The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 85 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued iv.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
h Inventories Inventories which comprise drilling consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by using weighted average cost method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of transportation and other related expenses.
i Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, expected future cash ows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reects, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
j Pensions and other post-retirement benets The Group does not operate its own pension plan but makes pension or superannuation contributions to private funds of its employees which are dened contribution plans.
The cost of providing such benets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
k Employee benets Salaries, wages, annual leave and sick leave Liabilities for salaries and wages, including non-monetary benets, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect of employees services up to the reporting date.
They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method.
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.
Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outows.
l Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
m Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fullment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specic asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
COM 86 The Group has leases where the Lessor retains substantially all the risks and benets of ownership of the asset.
Such leases are classied as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
n Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake economic activity.
Where a Group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements the Groups share of jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses are included in the financial statements in their respective classication categories.
The Groups interests in joint ventures, which are in the form of jointly controlled assets, are identied in note 23.
The Group has a number of interests in joint ventures, which are considered jointly controlled assets, whereby the venturers have a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control over the economic activities of the asset.
The agreement requires unanimous agreement for financial and operating decisions among the venturers.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method.
The Group combines its proportionate share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture with similar items, line by line, in its consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Adjustments are made in the Groups consolidated financial statements to eliminate the Groups share of intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses on such transactions between the Group and its joint venture.
Losses on transactions are recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment loss.
The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the joint venture.
Upon loss of joint control the Group measures and recognises its remaining investment at its fair value.
Any difference between the carrying amount of the former joint controlled entity upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal are recognised in the income statement.
When the remaining investment constitutes significant inuence, it is accounted for as investment in an associate.
o Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
The specic recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised: Interest income Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest rate method, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
p Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be prepared for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
q Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined with reference to the market value of the underlying shares using a pricing model appropriate to the circumstances which requires judgements as to the selection of both the valuation model and inputs.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 87 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition or a non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each statement of financial position date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated on the basis of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous statement of financial position date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modication, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modied award, both as measured on the date of the modication.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties, the goods or services received are measured at the date of receipt by reference to their fair value with a corresponding entry in equity.
If the Group cannot reliably estimate the fair value of the goods or services received, their value is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
r Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined on an individual basis according to the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
All exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of the Company and those foreign operations whose functional currency is other than that of the presentation currency of Ophir Energy Group are translated into the presentation currency, at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period.
The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
s Income taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date.
Current income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: WWW.
COM 88 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement.
t Impairment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an intangible asset or item of property plant & equipment may be impaired.
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available.
If no such transactions can be identied, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Groups CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash ows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for a property previously revalued and the revaluation was taken to other comprehensive income.
In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
2.4Signicant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on managements experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in deriving certain gures within the financial statements.
Such accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time.
The key areas of estimation are noted below with further details of the assumptions used listed in the relevant note.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is not sufficient certainty that taxable income will be realised in the future due to the nature of the Groups international exploration activities and the long lead times in either developing or otherwise realising exploration assets.
e Other unrecognised temporary differences The Group has other unrecognised temporary differences in the UK, Australia and various African countries totalling $190,976,200 2011: $148,534,880 in respect of provisions and exploration expenditure for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
f Change in corporation tax rate Deferred tax has been calculated at the rates substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
The main United Kingdom rate of corporation tax decreased from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012, and legislation to reduce the rate to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 has been substantively enacted during the year.
In addition the United Kingdom Government announced as part of the 2012 Autumn statement that the corporation tax rate was to be reduced to 21% previously 22% from 1 April 2014.

The goodwill balance is largely the result of recognising a deferred tax liability on the fair value uplifts of assets acquired through the Dominion acquisition.
Allocation of Goodwill Goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit CGU or groups of CGUs no larger than the reportable segment which are expected to benefit from the related acquisition.
A CGU is the smallest identiable group of assets that generates cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other assets or groups of assets.
This is usually considered a single operation or in some cases a number of operations that are in close geographic proximity or share operational efficiencies.
The carrying values of goodwill by CGU are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 Dec 2012 31 Dec 2011 $000 $000 Tanzania Block 7 107 Kenya Block L9 62 169 The following goodwill balances result from the requirement on acquisition to recognise a deferred tax liability, calculated as the difference between the tax effect of the fair value of the acquisition assets and liabilities and their tax bases.
For the purposes of testing this goodwill for impairment, any of the related deferred tax liabilities recognised on acquisition that remain at balance date are treated as part of the relevant CGU or group of CGUs.
Tanzania Block 7 36,190 Kenya Block L9 20,806 Deferred tax liability 56,996 Balance at the end of the year 57,165 Impairment test for Goodwill The Group performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis at reporting date.
The most recent test was carried out at 31 December 2012.
In determining whether goodwill is impaired the Group reviewed the status of projects including recent farm-out transactions and whether the Groups intention is to further develop the Groups various assets.
No impairment expense was recognised for the year ended 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: nil.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 95 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 11Business combinations The Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Dominion Petroleum Limited Dominion, an AIM quoted group of companies operating in the oil and gas exploration industry on 2 February 2012 the acquisition date.
The Group announced that the scheme of arrangement approved by Dominions shareholders on 12 December 2011 was sanctioned by the Supreme Court in Bermuda effective on 2 February 2012.
As a result of the acquisition the Group acquired a portfolio of assets in offshore Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and DRC, twoof which are operated by Ophir and which strengthens the Groups position as a leading oil and gasexplorer in the East African offshore play.
The financial statements include the statement of financial position of Dominion including fair value adjustments.
Revenues and expenses from the acquired assets are consolidated with effect from the acquisition date.
The purchase consideration of $220,221,437 was satisfied by a combination of cash and equity.
The Group issued 38,790,455 new shares in consideration for the entire share capital of Dominion.
The fair value of the shares was the published price of the shares of the Group at the acquisition date which was 2.951 $4.68.
Therefore, the fair value oftheshare consideration given was $181,539,329.
The remaining purchase consideration amount of $38,682,108 waspaid in cash.
Transaction costs relating to the acquisition of $3,709,030 have been expensed and are included inadministration costs.
The fair value assessment of the Dominion assets and liabilities acquired has been reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Details of the Group accounting policies in relation to business combinations are contained in note 2.3 d. The fair values of the identiable assets and liabilities of Dominion as at the date of acquisition and the corresponding carrying values immediately before the acquisition were: Fair Value recognised 2February 2012 $000 Exploration & evaluation assets note 9 228,000 Property, plant & equipment 441 Cash 15,908 Other current assets 7,063 Trade payables 1,612 Taxes payable 588 Other liabilities 29,300 Deferred tax liability 57,220 Net assets 162,692 Non-controlling interest 140 Total net assets acquired 162,832 Goodwill arising on acquisition note 10 57,389 Total purchase consideration 220,221 Purchase consideration: Fair value of shares issued 181,539 Cash paid 38,682 Total purchase consideration 220,221 Goodwill of $57.4 million arises on acquisition.
The goodwill on the transaction has principally arisen as a result of the requirement to recognise $57.2 million of deferred income tax liabilities representing the tax effect of the differences between the fair value and the tax bases of assets acquired.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
COM 96 The balance of the goodwill being $0.2 million is attributable to the synergies expected to arise from Ophirs current operations which are based in the same East African offshore play as other exploration and evaluation assets acquired.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2012 Dominion contributed $12,268 to Group revenue and $9,819,734 to Group loss.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, Dominions contribution to Group revenue and loss for the period to 31 December 2012 would have been $22,268 and $13,970,602 respectively.

19Financial instruments Capital management Capital consists of equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure it has sufficient funds to carry out its exploration activities and safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares for cash, engage in active portfolio management, or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2012.
Financial risk management The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities comprise trade and other receivables note 15, cash and short-term deposits note 16 and trade and other payables note 17, which arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash ow and provide finance for the Groups operations.
Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to these financial statements.
The Groups senior management oversees the management of financial risk and the Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to assist in the identication and evaluation of significant financial risks.
Where appropriate, consultation is sought with an external advisor to determine the appropriate response to identied risks.
The Group does not trade in derivatives for speculative purposes.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash ows are credit, interest rate, foreign currency and liquidity risks.
a Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a third party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of third parties is the aggregate of the carrying value of its security deposits, cash and short-term deposits, and trade and other receivables.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and as such collateral is not requested nor is it the Groups policy to securitise its trade and other receivables.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups experience of bad debts has not been significant.
No impairment loss has been recognised at the year ended 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: nil.

Credit risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the term of deposits to periods of less than twelve months and selecting counterparty financial institutions with reference to long and short-term credit ratings published by Standard & Poors.
Fair values The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of security deposits and receivables.
Collateral is not held as security.
The fair values and carrying values of non-current receivables of the Group are as follows: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value $000 $000 $000 $000 Security deposits 10,593 10,578 670 631 10,593 10,578 670 631 The fair values are based on cash ows discounted at a rate reecting current market rates adjusted for counter party credit risk.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying values.
COM 100 b Interest rate risk As of 31 December 2012, the Group has no borrowings 31 December 2011: Nil so interest rate risk is limited to interest receivable on deposits and bank balances.
The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rate relates primarily to the Groups cash assets held in short-term cash deposits.
The Board monitors its cash balance on an ongoing basis and liaises with its nanciers regularly to mitigate the risk of a uctuating interest rate.
The benchmark rate used for short-term deposits is US LIBOR.

c Foreign currency risk The Group has currency exposures arising from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and transactions executed in currencies other than the respective functional currencies.
The Group, with the exception of Ophir Services Pty Ltd, have adopted US Dollars as their functional and reporting currencies as this represents the currency of their primary economic environment as the majority of the Groups funding and expenditure is US Dollars.
Ophir Services Pty Ltd has adopted the Australian Dollar as its functional currency.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is managed by holding the majority of its funds in US Dollars, as a natural hedge, with remaining funds being held in Pounds Sterling GBP, Australian Dollars AUD, Euros EUR, Tanzanian Shillings TZS and CFA Franc BEAC XAF to meet commitments in those currencies.
As at 31 December 2012, the Groups predominant exposure to foreign exchange rates related to cash and cash equivalents held in Pounds Sterling by companies with US Dollar functional currencies.

The reasonably possible movement was calculated by taking the US Dollar spot rate as at statement of financial position date, moving this spot rate by the reasonably possible movements and then re-converting the US Dollar into the respective foreign currency with the new spot rate.
This methodology reects the translation methodology undertaken by the Group.
COM 102 d Liquidity risk The Group has a liquidity risk arising from its ability to fund its liabilities and exploration commitments.
This risk is managed by ensuring that the Group has sufficient funds to meet those commitments by monitoring the expected total cash inows and outows on a continuous basis.
All of the Groups trade creditors and other payables note 17 are payable in less than six months.
The Group did not make use of derivative instruments during the year or during the prior year.
e Disclosure of fair values The carrying value of security deposits and financial liabilities disclosed in the financial statements as at 31 December 2012 approximate their fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
