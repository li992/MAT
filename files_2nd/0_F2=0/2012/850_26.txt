Intheautumn statement, a further 1 percentage point reduction to 21 per cent by April 2014 was announced.
As at 31 December 2012, the reduction in the rate to 23 per cent had been substantively enacted.
However the remaining reductions in the rate were not substantively enacted before the year end and therefore the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decrease in the rate from 23 per cent to 21 per cent would increase the balance sheet deferred tax liability by approximately 2 million and would leave unrecognised deferred tax assets unchanged.
During the period to2014, the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity is estimated to be a charge of 2 million to theincome statement.

The review of unamortised goodwill for indications of impairment by management is performed against the three core segments of Natural Resources, Power & Process and Environment & Infrastructure, being the lowest level of cash generating units CGU monitored for goodwill purposes.
This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the three segments inorder to generate synergies.
Goodwill has been allocated between segments on a relative fair value basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax discount rates as set out in the table below.
Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates chosen are conservative.
For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two-year period include 2 per cent growth per annum 2011: 2 per cent, which is in line with long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The value in use has been compared to the carrying value foreach CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets reflect managements judgement of the future cash flows which includes past experience and 1 expectations of future performance.
The most significant assumptions relate to EBITA margin and the conversion of EBITA into cash cash conversion.
Revenue is underpinned by a secure order book for each CGU and the order book remains strong at 3.6 billion as at 31December 2012 2011: 3.7 billion.
The selection ofEBITA margin takes into account the margins being generated on contracts inprogress and managements view of the margin on orders received, and is consistent with Vision 2015 objectives.
The cash conversion reflects past experience and current contract mix.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a 1 per cent decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two-year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a 1 per cent increase in discount rate, did notidentify any impairments.

The principal defined benefit schemes are in the UK, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
These schemes were closed to new members during the year but remain open to further accrual.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 31 March 2011 andupdated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes asat 31 December 2012.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2012.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 31December 31December 2012 2011 per cent per cent Rate of discount 4.5 4.7 Rate of inflation 2.9 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 2.9 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment service before after 1 January 2008 2.8 2.0 3.0 2.3 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 4.5 8.1 Bonds 4.5 4.7 Gilts 4.5 3.1 Property 4.5 5.1 The main overseas schemes as at 31 December 2012 consist of three funded defined benefit schemes held in Canada and TheLaw Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan that was acquired as part of the acquisition of MACTEC.
Adiscount rate of 4.3 per cent 2011: 4.6 per cent and salary inflation rate of 2.75 per cent 2011: 2.75 per cent have been used for the three defined benefit schemes held in Canada.
A discount rate of 3.7 per cent 2011: 4.6 per cent has been used for the Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan retirement scheme.
No further benefits are being accrued in this scheme.
For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: 31December 31December 31December 31December 2012 2012 2011 2011 Male Female Male Female years years years years Member aged 65 current life expectancy 22.8 24.3 22.7 24.1 Member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.6 26.2 24.5 26.1 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 89 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities continued Defined benefit schemes continued The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 5.4 per cent assumption as at 31December 2011.
In line with IAS 19 2011 the expected rate of return on scheme assets will in future be in line with therate of discount.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 31December 31December 2012 2011 million million Retirement benefit assets 86 32 Retirement benefit liabilities 93 81 Retirement benefit net liability 7 49 The retirement benefit liabilities of 93million 2011: 81million reflect primarily the deficits on the overseas schemes.

Factors affecting the tax charge in future years There are a number of factors that may affect the groups future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with taxauthorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation andtax rates.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 31December 31December 2012 2011 million million Deductible temporary differences 20 15 Tax losses 14 20 34 35 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 93 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets continued Tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.
In addition, claims have been made to HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to offset tax losses of up to 79 million against thegroups UK taxable profits.
These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 31December 2002.
If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK corporation tax.
The amount and availability oftherefund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC.
This potential refund is not included as an asset in the accounts.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 551million 2011: 474 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be 29million 2011: 24 million.

19 Capital and financial risk management Capital management The objective of the groups capital management is to ensure that it has a strong financial position from which to grow the business to meet its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value.
The appropriate capital structure for the group would comprise a mix of debt and equity.
The mix would be determined by considering business profile and strategy, financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
The group is currently in a net cash position.
The long-term net debt is expected to be no more than two times EBITDA.
The group may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it.
However, it is expected that any increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
On 18 July 2012, a 377 million multi-currency revolving credit facility was entered into with a number of core relationship banks.
The facility is committed for five years and is available for general corporate purposes.
At 31 December 2012 150million of the facility had been utilised.
In February 2012, the board approved a share buyback programme of 400 million.
As at 31 December 2012 a total of 33million shares had been purchased under this programme, including through close periods by the use of forward share purchase contracts.
The group completed the buyback programme on 8 February 2013.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2012 or 2011.
Financial risk management The principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange risk: funding and liquidity risk: counterparty credit risk: and interest rate risk.
The board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
The groups treasury department manages funding, liquidity, credit risk and risks arising from movements in interest and foreign currency rates within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board.
The treasury department does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board, most recently in October2012.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 95 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Foreign currency exchange risk The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling.
The majority of the groups trading income is denominated in the local currency of the business operations which provides a natural hedge against the currency of its cost base.
Where commercial contracts are undertaken which are denominated in foreign currencies, the group seeks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk, when the cash flow giving rise to such exposure becomes certain or highly probable.
This is achieved through the use of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options.
There are currently no material transactional exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged.
AMEC has no reason to believe that any outstanding forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial transactions.
A portion of the groups earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies.
Such overseas profits are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the year.
There is currently no hedging in place for profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis.
In addition, the group has various assets denominated in foreign currencies, principally US Dollars and Canadian Dollars.
A proportion ofthese assets, including unamortised goodwill, has been designated in net investment hedges using cross-currency instruments.
The policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business.
The existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature.
In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of foreign assets, the group may from time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risks.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in, non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2012 2011 2012 2011 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 13 4 Current liabilities 13 39 4 26 43 4 The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur and the periods in which they are expected to impact profit or loss: 2012 Carrying Expected 12 months 1 to 2 2 to 5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 1312 1 Liabilities 13931 2621 4 1 2011 Carrying Expected 12 months 1 to 2 2 to 5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 4 4 Liabilities 4 39 38 1 4 43 42 1 In neither 2012 nor 2011 was there any charge for ineffectiveness recognised.
96 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk fair value through income statement Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2012 2011 2012 2011 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 71 76 2 Current liabilities 73 125 3 144 201 1 Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk net investment hedges The group currently has forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in core subsidiaries in Canada and the US.
The group has revised its policy and the existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2012 2011 2012 2011 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 118 2 Non-current assets Current liabilities 14 33 3 8 Non-current liabilities 14 3 14 165 3 9 A net foreign exchange gain for the year of 1million 2011: 4million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps.
Other financial derivative assets and liabilities The group has other financial derivative assets of 1million 2011: nil and financial derivative liabilities of 1million 2011: nil.
Sensitivity analysis The group hedges its material transaction-related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss sensitivity.
With respect to translation-related exposure, the group hedges a proportion of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
A 10 per cent movement in Sterling Canadian Dollar and Sterling US Dollar rates results in a 2 million credit charge 2011: 14 million to other comprehensive income arising on net investment hedges.
Thiswould be offset by a credit charge on the hedged net investment.
Funding and liquidity risk The groups policy aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements consistent with the groups budget and strategic plans.
The group will finance operations and growth from its existing cash resources and the 377 million multi-currency revolving credit facility.
The requirement to enter into additional external facilities has been kept under review during 2012.
Appropriate facilities will be maintained to meet ongoing requirements for bank guarantees and letters ofcredit.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 97 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Counterparty credit risk The group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the groups risk management activities.
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially throughcontract payment terms.
Where appropriate, payment security is sought.
Credit control practices are applied thereafter during the project execution phase.
A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the board approved treasury policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the groups exposure to credit risk from itstreasury activities by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25 to 30 mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board and are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poors and Fitch.
Credit ratings are monitored continually by thegroup treasury department.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid an over-concentration ofexposure to any one counterparty.

Net receivables asat 31December 2012 include nil 2011: 2million in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year.
The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2012 2011 million million As at 1January 20 22 Net impairment allowance credited 5 2 As at 31December 15 20 Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government-backed organisations and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer in 2012 accounted for around 15 per cent 2011: 14 per cent of continuing revenues, and a similar percentage of current trade and other receivables.
The revenue was included in the groups Natural Resources and Environment & Infrastructure divisions.
98 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year.
Long-term interest rate hedging for periods beyond three to six months was not considered appropriate as the surplus cash position is viewed as temporary.
The 377 million multi-currency revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin depending onleverage.
Interest rate risk contractual maturity and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature: 2012 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less per cent million million Short-term investments 0.94 17 17 Cash and cash equivalents excluding bank overdrafts 0.98 258 258 Bank overdrafts 0.53 26 26 Bank loans 1.67 150 150 99 99 2011 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less per cent million million Short-term investments 1.15 28 28 Cash and cash equivalents 0.99 493 493 521 521 Group borrowing The groups borrowings bank overdrafts and bank loans are all denominated in Sterling.
There were no borrowings as at 31 December 2011.
All covenants attached to borrowings have been complied with throughout the year.
Fair values Fair values are determined using observable market prices level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures as follows: The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate.
20 Other non-current receivables and payables Other non-current receivables of 27 million 2011: 23 million represent indemnities received on the acquisition of MACTEC and, in 2012, certain insurance receivables, both of which are matched by liabilities included within provisions.
Trade and other payables of 11 million 2011: nil represent lease incentives received which are being amortised over the period of the lease.

The provision for indemnities relates to the indemnification of the purchasers of SPIE in 2006, purchasers of the Built Environment businesses and other peripheral businesses in 2007.
These businesses are reported as discontinued operations and any adjustments to the provisions are treated as adjustments to the profits on disposal which were treatedas exceptional items.
The insurance provision relates to the potential liabilities in the groups captive insurance entity and provisions in relation to risks associated with insurance claims.
These potential liabilities and risks relate predominantly to industrial disease offormer employees.
Future outflows in respect of the onerous property contracts are expected to occur over the next several years.
Provision has been made for AMECs potential liability to fund loss-making joint venture entities.
The increase in the provision in 2012 includes an exceptional charge of 11 million in respect of funding a joint venture that was part ofarecentacquisition.
Due to the nature of the other liabilities, the timing of any potential future outflows is uncertain.
