The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in note 19: debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 20: and equity attributable to equity Shareholders of the Parent Company, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial management The Group continues to manage its interest rate and foreign currency exposure in accordance with the policies set out below.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings, receivables and payables that are used to finance the Groups operations.
The Group also uses derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The Groups treasury policies are designed to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates and to manage the Groups financial risks.
The Board approves any changes to the policies.
Liquidity risk The Group finances its borrowings from a number of sources including the bank, the public markets and the private placement markets.
The Group has developed long-term relationships with a number of financial counterparties with the balance sheet strength and credit quality to provide credit facilities as required.
The Group seeks to avoid a concentration of debt maturities in any one period to spread its refinancing risk.
100 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2012 I Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2012 21 Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to match, as far as possible, its principal projected cash flows by currency to actual or effective borrowings in the same currency.
As currency cash flows are generated, they are used to service and repay debt in the same currency.
Where necessary, to implement this policy, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps are taken out which, when applied to the actual currency liabilities, convert these to the required currency.
The borrowings in each currency can give rise to foreign exchange differences on translation into Sterling.
Where the borrowings are either less than, or equate to, the net investment in overseas operations, these exchange rate movements are treated as movements on reserves and recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
Non-Sterling earnings streams are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Fluctuations in exchange rates have given and will continue to give rise to translation differences.
The Group is only partially protected from the impact of such differences through the matching of cash flows to currency borrowings.
The Group has minimal exposure to the foreign currency risk of trade receivables and payables as operations within individual countries have little cross-border activity which might give rise to translation risks on trade-related balances.
The main currencies to which the Groups reported Sterling financial position is exposed are the US Dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
As set out above, the Group seeks to hedge its exposure to currencies by matching debt in currency against the cash flows generated by the Groups foreign operations in such currencies.
The effect on profit after tax and equity of a 10% strengthening of Sterling against these currencies on the Groups financial statements is shown below.
A 10% weakening would result in an equal and opposite impact on the profit or loss and equity of the Group.
The table below shows the impact on the financial instruments in place on 30 September and has been prepared on the basis that the 10% change in exchange rates occurred on the first day of the financial year and applied consistently throughout the year.

The Group implements this policy either by borrowing fixed rate debt or by using interest rate swaps so that the interest rates on at least 80% of the Groups projected debt are fixed for one year, reducing to 60% fixed for the second year and 40% fixed for the third year.
The sensitivity analysis given below has been determined based on the derivative and non-derivative financial instruments the Group had in place at the year end date only.
The effect of a 1% increase in interest rates prevailing at the balance sheet date on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and debt subject to variable rates of interest at the balance sheet date would be a loss of 3 million 2011: loss of 1 million over the course of a year.
A similar 1% decrease in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect over the course of a year.

The sensitivity gains and losses given above may vary because cash flows vary throughout the year and interest rate and currency hedging may be implemented after the year end date in order to comply with the treasury policies outlined above.
Credit risk The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to credit risk from the failure of any single financial counterparty by spreading its risk across a portfolio of financial counterparties and managing the aggregate exposure to each against certain pre-agreed limits.
Exposure to counterparty credit risk arising from deposits and derivatives including forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps is concentrated at the Group centre where possible.
Financial counterparty limits are derived from the long and short-term credit ratings, and the balance sheet strength of the financial counterparty and the long-term credit rating of the counterpartys country of domicile.
All financial counterparties are required to have a minimum short-term credit rating from Moodys of P-1 or equivalent from another recognised agency.
The Groups policy to manage the credit risk associated with trade and other receivables is set out in note 17.
Hedging activities The following section describes the derivative financial instruments which the Group uses to apply the interest rate and foreign currency hedging strategies described above.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value of fixed rate borrowings.
These instruments swap the fixed interest payable on the borrowings into floating interest rates and hedge the fair value of the borrowings against changes in interest rates.
These interest rate swaps all qualify for fair value hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows from floating rate borrowings.
These instruments swap floating interest payable on these borrowings into fixed interest rates and hedge against cash flow changes caused by changing interest rates.
The cash flows and income statement impact hedged in this manner will occur within three years of the balance sheet date.
These interest rate swaps do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 because the Group creates synthetic floating rate foreign currency borrowings see net investment hedges below through the use of forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps which IAS 39 prohibits from being designated as hedged items.
These interest rate swaps are an effective economic hedge against the exposure of the Groups floating rate borrowings to interest rate risk.
Net investment hedges The Group uses foreign currency denominated debt, forward currency contracts and cross currency swaps to partially hedge against the change in the Sterling value of its foreign currency denominated net assets due to movements in foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of debt in a net investment hedge was 1,123 million 2011: 911 million.
102 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2012 I Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2012 21 Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives not in a hedging relationship The Group has a number of derivative financial instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
These include some interest rate swaps and some forward currency contracts.
Fair value measurement The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques which use inputs that have significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data All derivative financial instruments are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair values have been determined by reference to Level 2 techniques in the hierarchy described above.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments represent the maximum credit exposure.
