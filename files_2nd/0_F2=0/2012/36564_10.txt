ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 29 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 3 Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, as detailed in the Directors Report on page 71 and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of investment properties and certain financial instruments.
Certain comparative amounts have been adjusted where relevant to ensure comparability with the current years presentation.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the noncontrolling interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interest of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.
Adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets and liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and 30 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Non-controlling interests in the acquiree are measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost.
If the Groups interest in the fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale, except investment properties, are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Investment properties classified as held for sale are carried at fair value.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Rental income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Where a lease incentive is granted, which does not enhance the value of the property, or a rent-free period is granted, the effective cost is amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Property management fees are recognised in the period to which they relate.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Revenue from the sale of trading and investment properties is recognised when the significant risks and returns have been transferred to the buyer.
This generally coincides with the transfer of the legal title or the passing of possession to the buyer.
The profit on disposal of trading and investment properties is determined as the difference between the consideration received and the carrying amount of the asset at the commencement of the accounting period plus any additions in the period.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 31 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Where a property is held under a head lease it is initially recognised as an asset as the sum of the premium paid on acquisition and the present value of minimum ground rent payments.
The corresponding rent liability to the head leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Where only the buildings element of a property lease is classified as a finance lease, the ground rent payments for the land element are shown within operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
When accounting for a lease of land and buildings, the Group considers the land and buildings elements separately.
The Group does not classify those land elements that are held under operating leases as investment property.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in Pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups foreign currency translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Share-based payments The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Companys estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model or the Companys share price less the discounted value of estimated future dividends, as appropriate.
The expected life used in the binomial model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
32 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit on sale of subsidiaries, but before changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, finance income, finance costs and foreign exchange movements relating to intercompany funding.
Property, plant and equipment This comprises computers, fixtures and fittings and office equipment, which are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of computers, fixtures and fittings and office equipment, less residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Computer equipment three years Fixtures and fittings five years Office equipment three years Investment properties Investment properties, which comprises freehold and leasehold property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation, are treated as acquired when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
Acquisitions of investment properties including related transaction costs and subsequent additions of a capital nature are initially recognised in the accounts at cost.
At each reporting date the investment properties are revalued to their fair values based on a professional valuation at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in profit or loss for the period in which they arise.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 33 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Trading properties Trading properties are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are treated as acquired when the Group assumes the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
Cost includes development costs specifically attributable to properties in the course of development.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale AFS financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets are classified as at FVTPL where the financial asset is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classified as held for trading if: it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future: or it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking: or it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
34 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS A financial asset other than a financial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial asset forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis: or it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives that can be designated as FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
AFS financial assets Non-derivative financial assets that are not classified as loans and receivables or held-to-maturity investments, are not held for trading and are not designated as FVTPL on initial recognition are classified as AFS.
AFS financial assets are measured at fair value with fair value gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income.
On sale or impairment of the asset, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.
Impairment losses on AFS financial assets are recognised in profit or loss.
Dividends on an AFS equity instrument are recognised in profit or loss when the entitys right to receive payment is established.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
Objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 35 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Where an AFS financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit and loss in the period.
In the case of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period the amount of impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is not reversed through profit and loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and are subsequently measured at the higher of: the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: and the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policies set out above.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: 36 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in the near future: or it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit-taking: or it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis: or it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives that can be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
fide-recognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a fide-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
Derivative financial instruments The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk, including foreign exchange forward contracts and options and interest rate swaps and caps.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 37 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date used in preparing these accounts are: Property valuations In determining the fair value of investment properties there is a degree of uncertainty and judgement involved.
The valuations are based on a number of assumptions, the significant ones of which are the appropriate discount rates, estimates of future rental income and capital expenditure.
The Group uses external professional valuers to provide independent valuations of the investment properties.
Derivative financial instruments In determining the fair value of derivatives, there is a degree of judgement involved.
The valuations of these derivatives are performed by external professionals.
Deferred tax Determining the amount of tax losses to be recognised as deferred tax assets requires management to estimate the level and probability of future taxable profits that those losses can be offset against, in each relevant entity and jurisdiction.
Valuation of share based payments In calculating the expense in relation to share based payments, the Company is required to estimate the probability of share and options awards vesting and the fair value of a share and option at the grant date and the balance sheet date.
These estimates involve making a variety of assumptions concerning rents and related costs, yields, administrative costs, interest rates, exchange rates, dividend rates and the rate and level of property acquisitions.

The recoverable amounts are determined on the basis of fair value less costs to sell by reference to the valuation of the underlying properties as performed by external valuers.
The assumptions in relation to determining the fair value of the Belgian portfolio are the fair value of the investment properties and the discount to be applied in the sale transaction in respect of deferred tax liabilities.
On disposal of a Belgium company, a sales price discount may be negotiated because of the potential capital gains tax.
The discount varies widely and is open to negotiation.
A discount of greater than 50% 2011: 50% would lead to an impairment of the goodwill relating to the Belgian portfolio.

2005 Share Option Scheme The 2005 Share Option Scheme is open to certain senior employees of the Group and currently has six participants one of whom, Richard Lowes, was granted options prior to becoming an Executive Director of the Company.
None of the other Directors of the Company have been granted options under the Scheme.
In the case of options granted within three months of admission of shares to trading on AIM, options are exercisable at the price at which shares were placed in connection with the float, being 1 per share.
All options granted after this date are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the ordinary shares of the Company on the date of grant.
The options have a three-year vesting period that is not subject to performance conditions.
The options expire if they remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
No options were granted under this scheme during the year.
The aggregate fair value of the outstanding options is 352,000.
The weighted average remaining life is 5.97 2011: 6.97 years.

NAV is defined as the fully diluted EPRA NAV for the purposes of the LTIP.
The target for the bonus is that the NAV per ordinary share after adding back dividends and other returns to shareholders must exceed a compound growth rate of 10% per annum in a three-year period.
The bonus is calculated as 12.5% of the excess growth over the 10% growth target, multiplied by the number of ordinary shares in issue.
58 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Any amount payable under the Long-Term Incentive Plan is to be satisfied in full by ordinary shares of the Company.
No award was due for the three-year period ended 31 December 2012 and no LTIP awards have been made since flotation in 2005.
This bonus scheme will be repeated to reward performance in each three-year period, the next ending on 31 December 2015.
The price per share to be used when determining the number of shares which the Joint Chief Executives are entitled to will be the average mid-market quotation for such shares on the Main Market for the first 20 dealing days immediately following the end of the relevant period.
A progressive dividend growth policy is assumed in all fair value calculations.
Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP was introduced in 2012.
The PSP awards share options with a nil exercise price to Executive Directors and the senior management team.
The number of options granted is calculated with reference to the share price prior to the grant date.
To reflect the fact that 2012 is a transitional year between the 2005 Share Option Scheme and the PSP, two awards, each worth 75% of salary, were granted to participants, one with a two-year performance period and one with a three-year performance period.
Vesting of the awards is staggered over three years with one third vesting each year if performance targets are met.
Performance targets are based on Total Shareholder Return and Net Asset Value plus dividends relative to a peer group of listed UK REITs.

Where the financial instruments are held at fair value the valuation level indicates the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.

These risks include market risk including currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to economically hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Board and management on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Groups management reports quarterly to the Board and bi-annually to the Audit Committee, an independent body that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate risk exposures.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 63 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk, including: interest rate swaps and caps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates: and forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro as their functional currency.
Foreign currency risk management The Groups exposure to foreign currency arises from the fact that there are foreign operations which transact business denominated in Euros, with the translation of the local trading performance and local net asset to Sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date giving rise to an exposure to fluctuations in the Sterling:Euro exchange rate.
The Groups approach to managing this exposure is to fund investments in Euro-denominated operations with equity that is covered by forward currency contracts and options to limit the overall exposure of the Group.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated financial instruments at the reporting date are as follows.
The carrying amount of the Groups non-financial instruments in Eurodenominated operations is also presented.

64 HANSTEEN HOLDINGS PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The table below shows the impact of a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against the Euro in relation to financial instruments alone.
Group Group Company Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Increase foreign exchange rates by 10% Increase in profit before tax 16,993 12,461 17,363 12,689 Increase in other comprehensive income 38,638 36,968 - - Decrease foreign exchange rates by 10% Decrease in profit before tax 10,708 8,001 11,160 8,281 Decrease in other comprehensive income 47,224 45,183 - - Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and interest rate cap contracts.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments during the year.
Group Group Company Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Increase interest rates by 10% 6,546 4,005 2,123 1,722 Decrease interest rates by 10% 6,509 5,227 1,680 1,674 There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
Interest rate swap and cap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Under interest rate cap contracts, the Group has limited its exposure to increases in interest rates by capping interest payable on its borrowings.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is 132,209,000 2011: 181,029,000 comprising trade and other receivables and cash and cash deposits.
The Groups principal credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade receivables of 4,958,000 2011: 4,725,000 which consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to both the current and net assets of the Group and the Company.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the portfolio to either geographical business segment or company as the Group has a well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 3% 2011: 3% of the gross rent roll.
Other receivables consist principally of tax and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
Cash deposits are held at banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012 65 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which monitors the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements on a regular basis.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities.
As at 31 December 2012 the net debt to property value was 38.6% and the Group had 119 million of investment and trading properties that were not secured against the Groups borrowings.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest dates on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the interest and foreign currency rates as at the reporting date.
