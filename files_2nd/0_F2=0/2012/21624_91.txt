Risk Management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to achieve its investment objective as stated on page 19.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the revenue available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Groups risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks are set out below and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash ows of a financial instrument held by the Group may uctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 18 ii, interest rate risk see note 18 iii and market price risk see note 18 iv.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
52 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc ii Currency risk A proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency, and in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
At 31 December 2012 the value of non-sterling denominated investments amounted to 876,374,000 2011: 937,605,000.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Foreign currency borrowing and forward currency contracts are used to limit the Groups exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2012 are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, the principals have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall exposure.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the pro t after tax for the year and the equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for sterling US dollar, sterling Canadian dollar, sterling Australian dollar and sterling South African rand.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US dollar -5% 2011: 5% Sterling Canadian dollar -5% 2011: 5% Sterling Australian dollar -10% 2011: 5% Sterling South African rand -20% 2011: Sterling Peru nuevo sol -10% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each financial reporting date.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2012 2011 South US Canadian Australian African US Canadian Australian Peru dollar dollar dollar rand dollar dollar dollar nuevo sol 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 5% 5% 10% 20% 5% 5% 5% 10% Impact on revenue return 1,067 21 361 245 903 42 223 60 Impact on capital return 15,444 9,914 10,590 16,913 16,257 8,791 9,028 9,561 Total return after taxation for the year effect on shareholders funds 16,511 9,893 10,951 17,158 17,160 8,749 9,251 9,621 If sterling had strengthened against the currencies shown below, this would have had the following effect: 2012 2011 South US Canadian Australian African US Canadian Australian Peru dollar dollar dollar rand dollar dollar dollar nuevo sol 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Projected change 5% 5% 10% 20% 5% 5% 5% 10% Impact on revenue return 963 20 295 163 816 37 202 49 Impact on capital return 13,974 8,970 8,665 11,275 14,709 7,954 8,232 7,823 Total return after taxation for the year effect on shareholders funds 14,937 8,950 8,960 11,438 15,525 7,917 8,434 7,872 54 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc iii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk movements may affect the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings, the valuation of the Groups xed interest securities and the level of income receivable on cash deposits.
Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan and overdraft facilities.
The Group, generally, does not hold signi cant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
The Company nances part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
Derivative contracts are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: oating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set xed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2012 2011 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to oating interest rates: Bank loans 100,892 100,892 63,059 63,059 100,892 100,892 63,059 63,059 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in xed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between oating and xed interest rates change.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups xed interest securities amounted to 13.8% 2011: 12.6% of the portfolio.
These xed interest investments are susceptible to changes in market value which would therefore impact their yield.
The Group has limited exposure to interest rates as the majority of financial assets are equity shares which do not pay interest.
Therefore, the Groups total income and equity is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
Interest receivable and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances or paid on bank overdrafts loans respectively is approximately 0.15% and 1.75% per annum 2011: 0.15% and 1.25% per annum.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 31 December 2012 55 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued iv Market price risk Market price risk i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
The Groups investments are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of investments.
The Groups investment in contractual rights is exposed to commodity price risk arising from uncertainties about future prices of iron ore in addition to variables regarding the volume and quality of the iron ore produced.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manages the risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Groups objective and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Group manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on indices and on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
The Groups exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December 2012 on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments, options on indices and investment in contractual rights was 1,068,302,000 2011: 1,183,030,000.
Concentration of exposure to market price risks An analysis of the Groups investment portfolio is shown on pages 14 to 17.
At 31 December 2012, this shows that the portfolio had signi cant levels of investments in Latin America, Australia and South Africa.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Market price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the pro t after taxation for the year and the shareholders equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Groups investments including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in 2012.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups equities and equity exposure through options at each financial reporting date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2012 is a decrease of 694,000 2011: 3,076,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 211,577,000 2011: 236,606,000.

The following illustrates the sensitivity of the pro t after taxation for the year and shareholders equity to an increase or decrease of 10% in the future forecasts of iron ore prices on the fair value of the Groups investment in contractual rights.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups investment exposure in contractual rights at each financial reporting date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 10% increase in iron ore prices on the revenue return for the year ended 31 December 2012 is an increase of nil 2011: nil and on the capital return is an increase of 9,228,000 2011: nil.

56 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried in the Statements of Financial Position at their fair value investment and derivatives or at an amount which is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multi-currency loan facility.
Fair value hierarchy disclosures The table below sets out fair value measurements using the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy: Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Equity 1,059,584 8,718 1,068,302 Investment in contractual rights 67,502 67,502 Fixed interest securities 182,306 182,306 Total 1,241,890 8,718 67,502 1,318,110 Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2011 000 000 000 000 Equity 1,169,673 13,357 1,183,030 Fixed interest securities 151,408 18,660 170,068 Total 1,321,081 32,017 1,353,098 Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signi cant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset as follows: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets: Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using market observable inputs such as quoted prices: Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies in note 2 h. There was one transfer during the year between Level 2 and Level 3.
A reconciliation of fair value measurement in Level 3 is set out below.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued v Liquidity and credit risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter dif culty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity and credit risk is not signi cant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 30 million 2011: 30 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 120 million 2011: 120 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Groups assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity and credit risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, was as follows: Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2012 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 101,036 101,036 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 21,672 991 22,663 122,708 991 123,699 Not more 3 months than More than or less one year one year Total 2011 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Bank loans and bank overdrafts 63,248 63,248 Amounts due to brokers, accruals and provisions 5,283 1,316 6,599 68,531 1,316 69,847 The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Group of default: transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over the counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk migration criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Group of default: 58 BlackRock World Mining Trust plc
