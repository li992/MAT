In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.

The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities where practical in the same currencies as the Groups non-US Dollar assets.
These liabilities take the 15.6 Finance leases form of either borrowings or currency swaps.
The Group designates a portion of foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges.
As at 31 December 2012, CHFnil 2011 CHF32m of Group borrowings were designated as net investment hedges: the movement in the fair value of these hedges Accounting policy attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2012 was $nil 2011 $34m.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
The capital element of future lease payments is included Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion in borrowings and interest is charged to profit before taxation on a reducing balance basis over the term of the lease.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash flows 2012 2011 relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of $ million $ million profit within cost of goods sold within a further 12-month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Within one year 3 4 Sterling.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $1,250m 2011 $940m.
After one and within two years 3 3 Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would decrease by $8m 2011 increase of $11m.
In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all After two and within three years 3 3 other currencies, the Groups borrowings would decrease by $4m 2011 increase of $16m.
Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the decrease After three and within four years 3 3 would be $4m 2011 increase of $13m : this would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values.
After four and within five years 3 3 If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have After five years 6 9 been $23m lower 2011 $17m, which would be recognised through the hedging reserve.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2012 would have been $30m higher 2011 $24m.
Total minimum lease payments 21 25 A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2012 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown Discounted by imputed interest 5 7 above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Present value of minimum lease payments 16 18 Since it is the Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $2m 2011 $3m due within one year, $8m 2011 $7m due between one to five years and is not significant.

applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised through the income statement.
16 Financial instruments and risk management 16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps Accounting policy to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the Derivative financial instruments balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had no interest rate swaps 2011 $nil.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2012, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments and includes counterparty charge would increase by $5m 2011 $4m.
Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $5m 2011 $4m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other 16.3 Credit risk exposures comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from one of the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.

The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not Interest rate swaps transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2012 was $14m 2011 $21m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2012 was $178m 2011 $184m.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
in the income statement within other finance income costs as they arise.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.

Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.

260 287 i The analysis in this note for Other Plans combines both the funded and unfunded retirement benefit obligations.
The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countries in which it has major operating companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country.
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate.
Employees retirement benefits are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups major defined benefit pension plans in the UK and US were closed to new employees in 2003 and replaced by defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related current service cost are measured using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement.
