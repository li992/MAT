No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 21,309,000 2011: 17,137,000 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 31 December 2012 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which they operate.
