20 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, the Morrison and Safeway schemes, providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds: no part of the schemes is wholly unfunded.
The latest full actuarial valuations, which were carried out at 6 April 2010 and 1 April 2010 for the Morrison and Safeway schemes respectively, were updated for IAS 19 Employee benefits purposes for the period to 29 January 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
On 8 July 2010, the Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI will be used as the basis for inflationary increases to pensions in its next update of the statutory requirement.
Following this, the Accounting Standards Board has issued UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for retirement benefits clarifying the required accounting treatment and indicating the use of CPI rather than RPI where the scheme rules allow.
In the absence of specific guidance issued under IFRS, the requirements of this UITF have been applied in accounting for this change.
The Group has consulted with its advisers and, based on review of certain clauses in the schemes trust deeds, has concluded that this change is applicable to certain deferred members within the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The trust deeds state that, for those members affected, a statutory index should be used and therefore the actuarial assumptions applied within this financial report have been updated accordingly.
This resulted in a credit of 72m recognised in Other comprehensive income within actuarial gains losses during the prior year.
The Deed and Rules of the Morrison Pension Scheme gives the Trustees power to set the level of contributions.
In the Safeway scheme, this power is given to the Group, subject to regulatory override.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 30 January 2012 is 31m 2011: 36m.
84 Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 29 January 2012 20 Pensions continued b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below: i Financial 2012 2011 Rate of increases in salaries 4.55% 5.05% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.50%3.30% 3.30%3.80% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.75% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.30% 3.80% ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2012 2011 Male 24.4 24.2 Female 25.3 25.1 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2012 2011 Male 22.0 21.8 Female 23.0 22.8 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population, there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45-year-old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65-year-old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as long cohort and is in-line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities, the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up to date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2011: S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB.
As disclosed in the Critical accounting assumptions and estimates section on page 69, the results of the experience study conducted for the Safeway scheme have been used to adjust the longevity assumption for both schemes.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2012 2011 Long term rate of return on: Equities 5.90% 7.45% Corporate bonds 4.75% 5.60% Gilts 2.90% 4.44% Property related funds 5.60% Cash 1.50% 1.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The expected return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.

The allocation of assets between categories is governed by the investment principles of each scheme and is the responsibility of the trustees of each respective scheme.
The trustees should take due consideration of the Groups views and a representative of the Group attends Trustee Investment Committees.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Equities 1,054 1,001 Corporate bonds 724 667 Gilts 805 622 Property and property related funds 4 Cash 6 10 Total fair value of schemes assets 2,589 2,304 Present value of defined benefit funded obligation 2,600 2,266 Net pension liability asset recognised in the balance sheet 11 38 Related deferred tax asset liability note 19 2 10 Net deficit surplus 9 28 The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 2,304 2,111 Expected return on scheme assets 140 126 Actuarial gain recognised in other comprehensive income 148 62 Employer contributions 31 41 Employee contributions 10 10 Benefits paid 44 46 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 2,589 2,304 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Parent Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
