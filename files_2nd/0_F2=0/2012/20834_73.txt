Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements 3.2 Financial risk Risk management The following section describes the Groups investment risk management from a quantitative and qualitative perspective.
The Group has two main categories of assets: Underwriting assets premium received and held to meet future insurance claims.
Capital assets capital required by the regulators to support the underwriting business plus working capital and surplus funds.
Apart from the outstanding borrowings, these assets do not have specific current liabilities attached to them.
Investment governance The Group manages its investments in accordance with investment frameworks that are set by the Boards of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries the Boards.
These frameworks determine investment governance and the investment risk tolerance.
They are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the Boards fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities are being met.
Day to day management of the investments is delegated to the Investment Management Executive or members of the relevant subsidiarys executive, who are advised by the Chief Investment Officer.
The Investment Management Executive comprises the Chief Executive, Group Finance & Operations Director and Chief Investment Officer, and meets quarterly to consider whether the strategic asset allocation and tactical asset allocation ranges are appropriate to optimise investment returns within the risk tolerances set by the Boards.
Group Investments, led by the Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for tactical asset allocation and the appointment of external investment managers and custodians.
Risk tolerance Investment risk tolerances are set by the Board of Amlin plc and its subsidiaries.
The investment process is driven from the risk tolerance which is determined by reference to factors such as the underwriting cycle and the requirements of the capital providers.
In a hard underwriting market capital preservation is paramount in order to support the insurance business and, therefore, the risk tolerance for the capital assets will be low.
Conversely, the risk tolerance for the underwriting assets under these circumstances will be relatively high due to the strong cash flow.
In a soft underwriting market the opposite applies.
Investment risk is independently monitored by the Corporate Centre Risk department using a bespoke investment risk model.
The Head of Investment Risk reports regularly to the Investment Management Executive and to the Group Risk Committee.
Strategic asset allocation Each of the Groups principal subsidiaries has its own strategic asset allocations which are set according to its risk tolerance and liabilities.
1 The strategic asset allocation for capital assets are set by using a Value at Risk VaR model to determine the optimum asset allocation for the current risk tolerance, which ensures that appropriate solvency levels are maintained.
The expected timescale for future cash flows in each currency is calculated by the Group Actuarial team.
The average durations are the neutral position for the strategic asset allocation for the policyholders funds.
Tactical ranges around these strategic asset allocations provide flexibility to ensure that an appropriate risk reward balance is maintained in changing investment markets.
Investment management The investments are run on a multi-asset, multi-manager basis.
Exposure to the asset classes is achieved using physical or derivative instruments 2 and may be managed by Group Investments or by outsourced managers, on a segregated, pooled or commingled basis.
The manager selection is based on a range of criteria that leads to the expectation that they will add value to the funds over the medium to long-term.
The managers have discretion to manage the funds on a day to day basis within investment guidelines or prospectuses applicable to their funds that ensure that they comply with the investment frameworks.
The managers performance, compliance and risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
VaR is a statistical measure which calculates the possible loss over a year in normal market conditions.
As VaR estimates are based on historical market data this should not be viewed as an absolute gauge of the level of risk to the investments.
Segregated funds are managed separately for the Group.
Pooled funds are collective investment vehicles in which the Group and other investors purchase units.
Commingled funds combine the assets of several clients.

Market risk Valuation risk Where possible Group assets are marked to market at bid price.
Prices are supplied by the Groups custodians whose pricing processes are covered by their published annual controls reports.
In accordance with their pricing policies, prices are sourced from market recognised pricing vendor sources.
These pricing sources use closing trades or, where more appropriate in illiquid markets, pricing models.
These models typically use broker quotes or other independent valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models using observable or unobservable market inputs.
These prices are reconciled to the fund managers records to check for reasonableness.
Mark to market valuations for over the counter derivatives are supplied by the custodian and checked to the relevant counterparty and Bloomberg.
The Groups property fund portfolios are valued using the most recent net asset value provided by the fund managers which may be a quarter in arrears.
In such cases, adjustments may be made to bring the net asset value to a more current valuation.
Where an investment is made into a new property fund the transaction price is considered to be the fair value if it is the most recent price available.
As an additional level of governance over pricing, the Group validates the prices provided by pricing vendor sources against information obtained from Bloomberg where available, and conducts a review of stale prices at 31 December 2012, the impact of stale prices on the Groups investment valuation is considered immaterial.
Further details of the fair value measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities are included in note 3.3.
The valuation of investments is sensitive to equity risk.
The impact on profit before tax of a 1% improvement deterioration in the total market value of shares and other variable yield securities would be a 2.8 million gain loss 2011: 2.0 million.
Sensitivities in relation to other risks are considered in the remainder of note 3.2.

Risk disclosures continued Interest rate risk 3 Investors expectations for interest rates will impact bond yields.
Therefore, the value of the Groups bond holdings is subject to fluctuation as bond 4 yields rise and fall.
If yields fall the capital value will rise, and vice versa.
The sensitivity of the price of a bond is indicated by its duration.
The greater the durationof a security, the greater its possible price volatility.
Typically, the longer the maturity of a bond the greater its duration.
The maturity bands of the Groups bond holdings as at 31 December 2012 are shown below.
The duration of underwriting assets is set with reference to the duration of the underlying liabilities.
It should be noted that the liabilities are not currently discounted and therefore their value is not impacted by interest rate movements.
Cash is raised, or the duration of the portfolio reduced, if it is believed that yields may rise and therefore capital values will fall.
The average durations of the bond and cash portfolios for the underwriting assets and associated insurance liabilities as at 31 December 2012 were as follows: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Underwriting assets Years Years Years Years Sterling 0.1 2.2 0.4 3.5 US dollars 0.7 2.2 1.2 2.7 Euro 1.5 3.4 0.9 3.2 Canadian dollars 1.5 3.7 1.7 3.8 Note: The table above includes pooled vehicles.
The asset durations above are calculated by the custodian and are checked against those reported by the fund managers.
Liabilities durations are calculated by the Group Actuarial team.
An indication of the potential sensitivity of the value of the bond and cash funds to changes in yield is shown below.
The yield is the rate of return paid if a security is held to maturity.
The calculation is based on the coupon rate, length of time to maturity and the market price.
It assumes coupon interest paid over the life of the security is reinvested at the same rate.
The duration is the weighted average maturity of the securitys cash flows, where the present values of the cash flows serve as the weights.
132 132 Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Foreign exchange risk The exposure to translation, revaluation and asset liability currency matching risk combine to form the Groups overall exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Groups reporting currency is sterling and significant subsidiary functional currencies are sterling, euro and US dollar.
The Group holds asset and liability balances in base currencies of sterling, euro, US dollars, Canadian dollars, New Zealand dollars and Japanese yen.
Translation risk Foreign exchange translation risk exposure arises when business is written in non-functional currencies.
These transactions are translated into the functional currency of the relevant Group entity at the prevailing spot rate once the premium is received.
Consequently, there is exposure to currency movements between the exposure being written and the premium being converted.
Payments in non-functional currencies are converted back into the policy currency at the time a claim is to be settled, therefore the Group is exposed to exchange rate risk between the claim being made and the settlement being paid.
Revaluation risk The Group is subject to revaluation risk as a result of the translation into the Groups sterling reporting currency of the balance sheets of the Group entities that have a non-sterling functional currency.
At 31 December 2012, the Group was exposed to net investments in foreign operations balances totalling US$1,330.8 million 2011: US$1,061.6 million and 499.0 million 2011: 445.4 million.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with IAS 21, The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The loss recognised in other comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2012 was 57.1 million 2011: 38.9 million loss.
This reflects the movement in the US dollar rate from 1.55 at the start of the year to 1.62 at the balance sheet date and the movement in the euro rate from 1.20 at the start of the year to 1.23 at the balance sheet date.
In order to mitigate the impact of these currency fluctuations, the Group adopts a policy of hedging approximately 50% of the net currency exposure resulting from the net investments in foreign operations.
For this purpose, the Group uses a combination of subordinated debt, drawdowns on the revolving credit facility and options that are accounted for as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, in accordance with the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.
The effective portion of all unrealised and realised gains and losses on the designated portion of the hedging instruments are taken to reserves to match the underlying movement in the valuation of the net investment in foreign operations, with the ineffective portion recognised in profit or loss.
At the year end, hedges were in place for US$628.0 million 2011: US$589.0 million and 257.0 million 2011: 164.0 million.
The net realised and unrealised gain from hedging recognised in other comprehensive income during the year was 3.7 million 2011: 2.4 million gain.
In relation to revaluation of the net investment in foreign operations, if the US$ GBP exchange rates were to improve by 10%, this would result in an additional exchange gain of 141.0 million recognised in other comprehensive income.
This gain would be offset by a valuation loss of 23.9 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.
The same exchange rate deterioration would result in an additional 42.5 million exchange loss through other comprehensive income.
This loss would be offset by a valuation gain of 40.4 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.
If the EUR GBP exchange rate were to improve by 10%, this would result in an additional exchange gain of 43.8 million recognised in other comprehensive income.
This gain would be offset by a valuation loss of 14.3 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.
The same exchange rate deterioration would result in an additional 34.1 million exchange loss through other comprehensive income.
This loss would be offset by a valuation gain of 8.2 million on the designated portion of the hedging instruments.
Asset liability matching by currency risk If a liability in a currency other than the functional currencies of sterling, euro and US dollars is considered to be sufficiently large following a major event, for example such as the 2010 and 2011 New Zealand earthquakes, that currency will be bought and held as a base currency to cover the potential liability.
Underwriting assets are held in the base currencies of sterling, euros, US dollars, Canadian dollars, New Zealand dollars and Japanese yen, which represent the majority of the Groups liabilities by currency, thus limiting the underwriting asset liability matching currency risk.

Foreign exchange risk is mitigated by converting the subsidiaries functional currency profits into the Groups reporting currency.
Given the inherent volatility in some business classes, a cautious approach is adopted on the speed and level of sales, but the Group seeks to extinguish all currency risk on earned profit during the second year after the commencement of each underwriting year.
This approach avoids the inherent dangers of volatile sales.
It is not the intention to take speculative currency positions in order to make currency gains.
At 31 December 2012 the investment managers held some forward foreign exchange contracts in their portfolios to hedge non-base currency investments.
These were transacted with banks with a short-term rating of at least A1 and are marked to market in investment valuations.
Liquidity risk It is important that the Groups entities can pay their obligations as they fall due.
Levels of cash are therefore managed on a daily basis and buffers of liquid assets are held in excess of the immediate requirements.
This is to reduce the risk of being forced sellers of any of the Groups assets, which may result in realising prices below fair value, especially in periods of below normal investment market liquidity.
The Group funds its insurance liabilities with a portfolio of cash and debt securities exposed to market risk.

In addition pre-arranged revolving credit facilities are available note 31.
If a major insurance event occurs the investment strategy is reviewed to ensure that sufficient liquidity is also available in the assets.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Group becomes exposed to loss if a specific counterparty fails to perform its contractual obligations in a timely manner impacting the Groups ability to meet its claims as they fall due.
Credit risk can also arise from underlying causes that have an impact upon the creditworthiness of all counterparties of a particular description or geographical location.
The Groups credit risk is mitigated by the collateral received from counterparties, details of which are given in note 29.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in its investment portfolio and with its premium and reinsurance receivables.
The table below shows the breakdown at 31 December 2012 of the exposure of the bond portfolio, liquidity funds and 6 insurance and reinsurance receivables by credit quality.
Other relates to non-rated and rated lower than BBB, which includes insurance linked securities of 59.4 million 2011: 75.4 million and Spain sovereign bonds of 64.1 million 2011: 45.5 million included in AA.
Other includes 577.6 million 2011: 557.2 million of premium receivable from policyholders and 295.5 million 2011: 281.0 million of premium receivable from intermediaries that are not rated.
136 136 Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Insurance and reinsurance The table includes premium receivables, representing amounts due from policyholders.
The quality of these receivables is not graded, but based on historical experience there is limited default risk relating to these amounts.
Premium credit risk is managed through a number of controls that include broker approval, annual financial review and internal rating of brokers and regular monitoring of premium settlement performance.
Also included are reinsurance receivables, which represent the amounts due at 31 December 2012, as well as amounts expected to be recovered on unpaid outstanding claims including IBNR in respect of earned risks.
