Pension schemes With regard to the principal Group-funded defined benefit scheme in the UK the Menzies Pension Fund, to which the employees contribute, the charge to the income statement is assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice from Hymans Robertson LLP the Actuary, using the projected unit method.
Certain Group subsidiaries operate overseas and participate in a number of pension schemes, which are of a defined contribution nature.
The income statement charge for defined contribution schemes represents the contributions payable.
The pension charge to the income statement is analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Menzies Pension Fund 0.3 0.6 Other schemes 9.7 9.4 10.0 10.0 Financial assumptions The Actuary undertook a valuation of the Menzies Pension Fund as at 31 December 2012 2011: 31 December under IAS 19.
In deriving the results the Actuary used the projected unit method and the following financial assumptions: 2012 2011 % % Rate of increase in salaries 2.80 2.80 Rate of increase in pensions prior to 1 May 2006 3.40 3.40 Rate of increase in pensions from 1 May 2006 to 1 June 2010 2.20 2.50 Rate of increase in pensions after 1 June 2010 1.00 1.00 Price inflation 2.80 2.80 Discount rate 4.40 4.90 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice from the Actuary in accordance with published statistics and experience in the business.
As a result of the March 2009 triennial valuation, the scheme memberships were analysed into further categories and scheme mortality by category was adjusted in light of better information to take account of experience.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at 65 on the balance sheet date is: 2012 2011 Male 20.8 20.1 Female 22.4 21.8 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date is: 2012 2011 Male 21.6 20.7 Female 23.6 22.9 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 72 Fair value of assets and expected return on assets 2012 2011 Long-term Value at Long-term Value at rate of return December rate of return December % m % m Equities 6.5 153.9 6.5 147.4 Bonds 4.4 66.1 4.9 64.6 Property 5.5 24.9 5.5 27.8 Other 0.5 12.3 0.5 2.2 Total value of assets 257.2 242.0 Defined benefit obligation 325.3 306.3 Recognised in balance sheet 68.1 64.3 Related deferred tax asset Note 19 15.7 16.1 Net pension liabilities 52.4 48.2 Sensitivity analysis A reduction in the net discount rate will increase the assessed value of the defined benefit obligation and a rise in the discount rate will decrease the assessed value of the defined benefit obligation.
The overall effect of a change in the net discount rate for the Fund of 0.1% would be an increase decrease to the defined benefit obligation of around 2% or 6m.
The effect of changing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than the disclosed table would be to increase the assessed value of the defined benefit obligation by around 3% or 10m.
