Notes to the European Embedded Value Basis I.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The supplementary information on pages 147 to 156 shows the Groups results as measured on a European Embedded Value EEV basis.
This includes results for the life, pension and investment business, including unit trust business.
The valuation is undertaken on a basis determined in accordance with the EEV Principles issued in May 2004 by the Chief Financial Officers Forum, a group of chief financial officers from 19 major European insurers as supplemented by the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures issued in October 2005 together the EEV Principles.
The treatment of all other transactions and balances is unchanged from the primary financial statements on an IFRS basis.
The EEV basis recognises the long-term nature of the emergence of shareholder cash returns by reflecting the net present value of expected future cash flows.
Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of the products within the covered business.
The embedded value of the covered business is the sum of the shareholders net worth in respect of the covered business and the present value of the projected profit stream.
METHODOLOGY a Covered business The covered business is the life, pension and investment business, including unit trust business, undertaken by the Group.
b Calculation of EEV on existing business Profit from existing business comprises the expected return on the value of in-force business at the start of the year plus the impact of any changes in the assumptions regarding future operating experience, plus changes in reserving basis other than economic assumption changes, plus profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience for the period and the assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the end of the period.
c Allowance for risk The allowance for risk in the shareholder cash flows is a key feature of the EEV Principles.
The EEV Principles set out three main areas of allowance for risk in the embedded value: The risk discount rate: The allowance for the cost of financial options and guarantees: and The cost of holding both prudential reserves and any additional capital required.
The reported EEV allows for risk via a risk discount rate based on a bottom-up market-consistent approach, plus an appropriate additional margin for non-market risk.
The Group does not offer products that carry any significant financial guarantees or options.
d Non-market risk Best estimate assumptions have been established based on available information and when used within the market consistent calculations provide the primary evaluation of the impact of non-market risk.
However, some non-market operational risks are not symmetric, with adverse experience having a higher impact on the EEV than favourable experience.
Allowance has been made for this by increasing the risk discount rate by 0.8% 2011: 0.8%.
e The risk discount rate A market-consistent embedded value for each product class has been calculated.
In principle, each cash flow is valued using the discount rate applied to such a cash flow in the capital markets.
However in practice, where cash flows are either independent or move linearly with market movement, it is possible to apply a simplified method known as the certainty equivalent approach.
Under this approach all assets are assumed to earn the risk free rate and are discounted using that risk free rate.
A market-consistent cost of holding the required capital has also been calculated.
As part of this approach, an appropriate adjustment has been made to reflect the fact that the value of tax relief on expenses does not move linearly with market movements.
Finally, an additional allowance for non-market risk has been made by increasing the discount rate by 0.8%.
For presentational purposes, a risk discount rate has then been calculated which under the EEV basis gives the same value determined above.
This provides an average risk discount rate for the EEV and is described in relation to the risk free rate.
This average risk discount rate has also been used to calculate the published value of new business.

03183415 Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements Other Information f Cost of required capital In light of the results of internal analysis, the Directors consider that the minimum regulatory capital provides adequate capital cover for the risks inherent in the covered business.
The required capital for the EEV calculations has therefore been set to the optimised minimum regulatory capital.
The EEV includes a reduction for the cost of holding the required capital.
No allowance has been made for any potential adjustment that the investors may apply because they do not have direct control over their capital.
Any such adjustment would be subjective, as different investors will have different views of what, if any, adjustment should be made.
g New business The new business contribution arising from reported new business premiums has been calculated using the same assumptions as used in the EEV at the end of the financial year.
The value of contractual incremental premiums to existing business is treated as new business in the year of the increment, rather than at the outset of the policy.
This approach better reflects the way the Group manages its business.
The value of new business has been established at the end of the reporting period and has been calculated using actual acquisition costs.
h Operating profit Operating profit is determined as the increase in the embedded value over the year excluding market-related impacts such as the effects of economic assumption changes and investment variances and grossed up for shareholder tax.
i Tax The EEV includes the present value of tax relief on life assurance expenses calculated on a market-consistent basis.
This calculation takes into account all expense and income amounts projected for the in-force business including any carried forward unutilised relief on expenses.
In determining the market-consistent value an appropriate allowance is made to reflect the fact that the value of tax relief on expenses does not move linearly with market movements.
When calculating the value of new business, priority is given to relieving the expenses relating to that business.
ASSUMPTIONS a Economic assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December are set out below: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Risk free rate 1.8% 2.0% Inflation rate 2.5% 2.7% Risk discount rate net of tax 4.9% 5.1% Future investment returns: Gilts 1.8% 2.0% Equities 4.8% 5.0% Unit linked funds Capital growth 1.2% 1.4% Dividend income 2.9% 2.9% Total 4.1% 4.3% Expense inflation 3.4% 3.5% Annual Report and Accounts 2012 151 Notes to the European Embedded Value Basis continued III.
ASSUMPTIONS continued a Economic assumptions continued The risk free rate is set by reference to the yield on 10 year gilts.
Other investment returns are set by reference to the risk free rate.
The inflation rate is derived from the implicit inflation in the valuation of 10 year index-linked gilts.
This rate is increased to reflect higher increases in earnings related expenses.
b Experience assumptions The principal experience assumptions have been set on a best estimate basis.
The persistency assumptions are derived from the Groups own experience or, where insufficient data exists, from external industry experience.
The expense assumptions include allowance for both the costs charged by the relevant third party administrators for acquisition and maintenance, and the corporate costs incurred in respect of covered business.
The corporate costs have been apportioned so that the total maintenance costs represent the anticipated ongoing expenses, including systems development costs, which are expected to arise in future years in meeting the policy servicing requirements of the in-force business.
Mortality and morbidity assumptions have been set by reference to the Groups own experience, published industry data and the rates set by the Groups reassurers.
c Tax The EEV result has been calculated allowing for tax and has been grossed up to a pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account.
The corporation tax rate used for this grossing up is 21.3% 2011: 22.2% for UK life and pensions business, 12.5% 2011: 12.5% for Irish life and pensions business and 21.7% 2011: 23.4% for unit trust business.
Future tax has been determined assuming a continuation of the current tax legislation.
The reduction in tax rates for UK business reflects both the changes in tax rate enacted in the year, and also the further 2% reduction to which the government has committed in future years.

The business model is relatively insensitive to change in economic basis.
Note that the sensitivity assumes a corresponding change in all investment returns but no change in inflation.
Note 2: The 10% reduction is applied to the lapse rate.
For instance, if the lapse rate is 8% then a 10% sensitivity reduction would reflect a change to 7.2%.
Note 3: For the purposes of this required sensitivity, all unit linked funds are assumed to be invested in equities.
The actual mix of assets varies and in recent years the proportion invested directly in UK and overseas equities has exceeded 70%.
Note 4: Assumes the benefit of lower experience is passed on to clients and reassurers at the earliest opportunity.
Note 5: As a market-consistent approach is used, equity expected returns only affect the derived discount rates and not the embedded value or contribution to profit from new business.
Note 6: Assumed inflation is set by reference to 10 year index linked gilt yields.
