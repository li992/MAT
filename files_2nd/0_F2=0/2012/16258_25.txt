information about the Group and the accounting policies that apply to the consolidated financial statements as a whole.
Accounting policies that are specific to a particular note are provided within the note to which it relates.
This section also details the new or amended accounting standards adopted during the year as well as the anticipated impact of future changes to accounting standards that are not yet effective.
UBM plc is a public limited company incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991.
The registered office is Ogier House, The Esplanade, St. Helier, JE4 9WG, Jersey.
UBM plc was tax resident in the Republic of Ireland until 30 November 2012 when it returned to the United Kingdom.
The principal activities of the Group are described in Section 2.
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 1 March 2013.
They are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and are prepared under the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and hedged items which are measured at fair value.
The accounting policies are the same as those used for the previous financial year.
The Group has adopted the following amendments to IFRSs which have had no impact on the Groups accounting policies, financial position, performance or presentation of the financial statements: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures amended transfer of financial assets IAS 12 Income Taxes amended The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent company, UBM plc.
All amounts are rounded to the nearest 0.1m unless otherwise indicated.
Discontinued operations Following a strategic review initiated in July 2012, the Group has classified a disposal group Delta as held for sale at 31 December 2012.
Delta represents the bulk of the Groups Data Services segment but also includes operations within the Events, Marketing Services Online and Marketing Services Print segments.
Delta operates in the Health, Technology & IP, Trade & Transport, and Paper industries.
On 5 February 2013, the Group received a binding offer from Electra Partners LLP to purchase Delta for consideration of 160.0m including a 40.0m vendor loan note.
The offer is subject to consultation with the relevant works council in France which was completed on 25 February 2013 and certain regulatory and other approvals.
The transaction is also subject to working capital adjustments.
We expect the disposal to complete between March and July 2013.
The effective date of the disposal will be 1 January 2013 and Electra Partners LLP will receive the returns of the Delta businesses from that date.
The comparative information in the income statement and associated notes has been restated for the impact of the Delta discontinued operations.
In line with the requirements of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the statement of financial position has not been restated.
Going concern After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future see page 41 of the Financial review.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore prepared on the going concern basis.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise those of UBM plc the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in joint ventures and associates.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in full.
With effect from 1 January 2010, total comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it results in a deficit balance.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are entities over which the Group has entered into a contractual agreement with a third party to share control.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant influence through the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures.
The Group accounts for its interests in joint ventures and associates using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in the joint venture or associate is initially measured at cost.
The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date.
Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
The income statement reflects the Groups share of the results of operations of the entity.
The statement of comprehensive income includes the Groups share of any other comprehensive income recognised by the joint venture or associate.
All unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions with joint ventures and associates are eliminated in full.
80 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded by Group entities in their respective functional currency using the spot rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the functional currency spot rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.
Differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date.
Income and expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing in the month in which the transactions occurred.
The exchange differences arising on translation for consolidation are recognised in other comprehensive income and are shown as a separate component of equity, which was reset to zero on first time adoption of IFRS.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items designated as part of the hedge of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation are also recognised in other comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the accumulated amount of other comprehensive income held in a separate component of equity relating to that foreign operation is reclassified from other comprehensive income to profit or loss, along with the cumulative amount of exchange recognised in relation to hedging instruments Significant accounting judgments and estimates The preparation of the Groups consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosures.
Uncertainty about the assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes which differ from the estimates.
The judgments made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies that have the most significant effect on amounts recognised in the financial statements relate to: Unrecognised deferred tax assets Note 3.6 The identification of cash generating units and assumptions used in the impairment testing of goodwill Note 4.1 The measurement of retirement benefit obligations Note 7.2 The identification of intangible assets acquired in business combinations Note 6.1 The key areas of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date that could have a material effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year relate to: Current tax liabilities Note 3.6 Forecast cash flows used in annual impairment testing of goodwill Note 4.1 Provisions Note 4.6 Contingent consideration valuations Note 6.1 and put options over non-controlling interests Note 5.5 81 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation continued New and amended IFRS issued by the IASB but not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2012 The following new and amended IFRSs may have an impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: Accounting standard Requirements Impact on financial statements IFRS 9 Financial Financial assets will be measured at amortised cost or fair value.

Please refer to Note 7.2 for quantification of this change.
The following amendments to IFRS are not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements: IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements amended IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures amended IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation amendment Annual improvements 20092011 82 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Section 2: Segment information Operating segments The Group considers that operating segments presented on a products and services basis are the most appropriate way to demonstrate the performance of the Group.
This is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Group Chief Financial Officer, together the chief operating decision maker CODM.
The five reportable operating segments are: Events which provide face to face interaction in the form of exhibitions, trade shows, conferences and other live events: PR Newswire which provides communications products and services to professionals working in marketing, public relations, corporate communications or investor relations roles distributing messages, identifying target audiences and monitoring the impact: Marketing Services Online which provide website sponsorships and banner advertising as well as online directory products: Marketing Services Print which publishes magazines and trade press to specialist markets: and Data Services which comprise a range of services including data-based workflow products, intellectual property consultancy and analytical services and sales lead generation programmes.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the above reportable segments.
As discussed in Section 1, the Delta businesses have been reported as discontinued operations as at 31 December 2012.
Products that were previously classified as Data Services that are not part of Delta have been reclassified to Marketing Services Online and Events given their nature.
Segment measures The CODM assesses the performance of the operating segments and the allocation of resources using revenue and adjusted operating profit.
Adjusted operating profit is IFRS operating profit excluding amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, exceptional items and share of tax on results of joint ventures and associates.
Finance income expense and tax are not allocated to operating segments and are reported to the CODM only in aggregate.
Segment assets and liabilities are not reported to the CODM.
Transactions between segments are measured on the basis of prices that would apply to third-party transactions.

87 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Section 3: Operating profit and tax continued 3.6 Tax This note details the accounting policies applied for tax, the current and deferred tax charges or credits in the year, a reconciliation of profit before tax to the tax charge and the movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Accounting policy Current tax for the current and prior periods is recognised, to the extent unpaid, as a liability at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities.
The tax liabilities are measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
However, deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
Current tax expense and deferred tax expense are recognised in the income statement except to the extent they arise from a transaction or event recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Any such tax expense is recognised in other comprehensive income or in equity respectively.
The Group is a multi-national group with tax liabilities arising in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to complexity to the Groups tax structure.
Therefore the calculation of the Groups current tax liabilities and tax expense necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgment in respect of items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
The tax liabilities recognised in the financial statements are measured at the directors estimate of tax that may become payable.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period identified.

These have been recognised as the Group expects to generate taxable profits against which these will be used.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 50.3m relating to deductible temporary differences and 140.2m of which 93.6m will expire between 2019 and 2032 relating to unused tax losses 2011: 55.6m and 148.1m of which 102.7m will expire between 2019 and 2031 respectively.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these amounts due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.
The Group also has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 56.4m 2011: 51.6m relating to unused capital losses which can only be utilised against future capital gains.
At 31 December 2012, there was no deferred tax liability recognised for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that profits of subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised amount in aggregate to 4.2bn 2011: 6.0bn.
89 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Section 3: Operating profit and tax continued 3.7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent entity by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Adjusted basic earnings per share excludes amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions, deferred tax on amortisation of intangible assets, exceptional items and net financing expense adjustments detailed in Note 5.4.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the effects of dilutive options: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2012 would be to increase weighted average shares by 4.6 million shares 2011: 4.3 million shares.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan the ESOP.

4.1 Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is measured on acquisition as the excess of the aggregate of consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and in the case of business combinations achieved in stages the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If the initial amount of goodwill is negative, the amount is recognised in profit or loss as a gain on a bargain purchase.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment tests, the goodwill arising from each business combination is allocated to cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the combination and which represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitors goodwill.
The impairment test requires the Group to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates: this is performed with the assistance of external advisors.
Recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use of a CGU is measured by discounting the estimated future cash flows of the CGU to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate.
Fair value less costs to sell is generally measured using an earnings multiple approach using revenue and EBITA multiples obtained from comparable businesses and transactions.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated and monitored by management at a cash generating unit CGU level, consisting of the 13 business units operating across the Groups operating segments.
Not all business units are active in all segments: there are 29 CGUs at 31 December 2012 2011: 31 CGUs.
For reporting purposes, the CGUs have been aggregated into the reportable segments, as shown in the tables below.
The CGUs are individually tested for impairment each year.
Goodwill of 23.6m was transferred from the Data Services segment to the Marketing Services Online segment to be consistent with the product reporting, as described in Section 2 Segment information.
Impairment testing for these businesses was performed before the reallocation took place.
Within the Events segment, management considers the UBM TechWeb Events and UBM Live Events CGUs to be significant.
The carrying amount of goodwill attributed to these CGUs at 31 December 2012 was 170.8m and 360.2m respectively 2011: 171.5m and 339.0m respectively.
Within the Data Services segment, management considers the UBM Medica Data Services CGU to be significant.
The carrying amount of UBM Medica Data Services goodwill at 31 December 2012 is classified as held for sale 2011: 192.0m.
The PR Newswire CGU as reported above is also considered to be significant.

Impairment tests for goodwill For the years ended 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the carrying amount of each CGU excluding the Delta businesses in 2012 has been compared with its estimated value in use.
The UBM Electronics Events CGU has been impaired by 1.0m.
The following key assumptions were used by management in the value in use calculations: Pre-tax discount rate Perpetuity growth rate % % Cash flow forecasts Events 2012: 11.3 13.9 2012: 0.7 2.5 Event revenue is expected to continue to grow with continued 2011: 11.5 14.3 2011: 1.3 3.5 expansion in Emerging Markets.
PR Newswire 2012: 13.1 2012: 2.3 Continued steady growth of the core wire distribution, engagement 2011: 11.7 2011: 2.0 and workflow data businesses.
Expansion into the marketing offerings.
Continued expansion in high growth markets such as China.
Continued investment in products, IT technology and in sales and marketing to drive continued growth in the changing competitive and technological environments.
Marketing Services Online 2012: 10.4 14.1 2012: 0.7 2.5 The continued rebalancing of the product portfolio, away from print 2011: 11.4 12.0 2011: 1.3 1.7 to digital.
Investment in products and IT technology.
Marketing Services Print 2012: 13.0 19.7 2012: 1.7 Continued rationalisation and optimisation of the print portfolio with 2011: 11.5 12.3 2011: 1.3 2.5 further non-core titles either closed or sold, expected to result in stabilisation of print margins.
Forecast cash flows For each CGU, the forecast cash flows for the first five years are based on the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management.
The forecast cash flows, budgets and forecasts are based on assumptions that reflect past experience, long term trends, industry forecasts and growth rates and management estimates see above.
For each CGU, the forecast cash flows beyond the period covered by the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management are based upon the weighted average projected real gross domestic product growth rate in 2016 of each of the territories in which the CGUs operate 2011: 2015.
Growth rates for each territory have been weighted based on contribution to 2013 budgeted revenue 2011: contribution to 2012 budgeted revenue.
The growth rates used in the value in use calculation range from 0.7% to 2.5% 2011: 1.3% to 3.5%, depending on the territories and industries in which each CGU operates.
Discount rate The discount rate for each CGU is based on the risk-free rate for 20 year US government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk of investing in equities, the systematic risk of the specific CGU and taking into account the relative size of the CGU and the specific territories in which it operates.
The increased risk of investing in equities is assessed using an equity market risk premium which reflects the increased return required over and above a risk free rate by an investor who is investing in the whole market.
The equity market risk premium used is based on studies by independent economists and historical equity market risk premiums.
92 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 4.1 Goodwill continued The risk adjustment for the systematic risk, beta, of the CGU reflects the risks specific to the CGU for which the forecast cash flows have not been adjusted.
The adjustment to the rate has been determined by management using an average of the betas of comparable companies within respective sectors.
Sensitivities Following the charge for impairment, the estimated recoverable amount of the UBM Electronics Events CGU is equal to its carrying amount of 2.5m at 31 December 2012.
Consequently, any adverse change in key assumption would, in isolation cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
Other than as disclosed below, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
The estimated recoverable amount of UBM Connect Online is not significantly higher than its carrying amount.
The tables below show the carrying amount of the goodwill in the CGU, the amount by which the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds the carrying amount of the CGU the headroom and the reasonably possible percentage changes needed in isolation in each of the key assumptions that would cause the recoverable amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount.
The cash flow forecasts for 2012 and 2011 are expressed as the compound average growth rates in the initial five year forecasts of the plans used for impairment testing.

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised in accordance with the accounting policy for acquisitions Note 6.1 and measured on initial recognition at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Internally generated intangible assets, including internally generated software, that do not qualify for recognition as an intangible asset under IAS 38 are recognised as an expense.
All research costs are expensed as incurred.
At each reporting date, intangible assets are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition less amortisation and any impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives as follows: Brands 10-15 years Software 5-6 years Customer contracts and relationships 1-10 years Subscription lists 2-5 years Trademarks 10 years Databases 2-10 years Website development costs 3 years Useful lives are re-examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable are made on a prospective basis.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.

94 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 4.3 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on all items except freehold land.
Depreciation rates are calculated so that assets are written down to the residual value in equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives, which are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold property Up to 70 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease General plant, machinery and equipment 5-20 years Computer equipment 3-5 years Motor vehicles 3-5 years An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.
Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the item is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised.
The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of the assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

If the effect is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are estimates and the actual cost and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Management reassesses the amounts of these provisions at each balance sheet date in order to ensure that they are measured at the current best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Any difference between the amounts previously recognised and the current estimates is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.

The amounts recorded in the above tables are continually evaluated by management.
Liabilities for reorganisation and restructuring The provision relates to the remaining integration costs for UBM Canon and other small reorganisation and restructuring projects.
The provision balance of 0.6m is expected to be utilised within one year.
Liabilities on properties The provisions relate to obligations in respect of the continuing costs of vacant property.
The quantification of the provisions depends upon the ability to exit the leases early or sublet the properties.
The provisions also relate to obligations in respect of dilapidations on leasehold properties.
The quantification of these provisions are dependent on actual reinstatement costs on expiry of the leases.
The provisions at 31 December 2012 have been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases, which range from one to five years.
The provision is discounted at an appropriate cost of capital.
Liabilities relating to disposals The provisions relate to obligations arising from warranty and other claims brought against the Group in relation to disposed businesses over periods of up to seven years after the date of disposal.
The provision in respect of these items has been determined based upon the contract terms of each disposal and are reassessed on an annual basis over the period during which claims may be brought against the Group.
100 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy The section covers financial assets, financial liabilities and equity held by the Group, along with associated income and expenses.
This includes cash, borrowings, put option arrangements and derivatives: working capital information is included in Section 4.
The instruments in place enable the Group to maintain its required capital structure: retaining conservative capital ratios in order to support the business and maximise shareholder value.
Further details of the Groups capital structure and financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are provided on pages 37 to 39 of the Financial review.
Accounting policy On initial recognition, financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition of derivatives and investments are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Transactions costs on other financial assets and financial liabilities are added to the carrying amounts.
Derivatives are classified as either financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and measured at each reporting date at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents are classified as loans and receivables and measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The cash equivalents are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities, other than derivatives, are measured at each reporting date at amortised cost.
Amortised cost takes into account any differences between the proceeds and the maturity amount, including issue costs and any discounts or premiums due on settlement.
Such differences are recognised as interest expense in the income statement over the expected life of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost calculation is revised periodically to reflect changes in the expected cash flows and the expected life of the borrowings including the effects of the exercise of any prepayment, call or similar options.
Any resulting adjustment to the carrying amount of the borrowings is recognised as interest expense in the income statement.
Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such a modification or exchange is treated as derecognition of the original liability and recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the carrying amounts of the original liability and the fair value of the new liability is recognised in the income statement.
5.1 Movements in net debt The definition of net debt has been changed in 2012 to include derivatives that are associated with debt instruments.
This facilitates a more accurate reflection of the estimated settlement at maturity and is consistent with reporting by other companies.

The loans bore interest for the first three years at six month EURIBOR plus 1.80%.
In March 2012, as provided in the terms, the Group redeemed the loans by paying the fair value of the instruments on that date, 63.3m 52.7m.
In 2011, the future estimated cash flows were re-assessed to include the expected cost of settling the option, resulting in a carrying amount of 52.9m and an exceptional interest expense of 8.5m at 31 December 2011.
300m variable rate multi-currency facility 2016 In May 2011, the Group arranged a five year 300m variable rate multi-currency facility to replace the cancelled 325m variable rate multi-currency facility due 2012.
The 300m facility bears interest of LIBOR plus 1.0% whilst the UBM plc rating is BBBBaa3 UBMs current ratings.
The future interest rate is dependent on the credit rating of UBM plc: the rate will be revised to LIBOR plus 1.35% for a downgrade to BB Ba1: LIBOR plus 1.75% for downgrade to BB Ba2 or lower: LIBOR plus 0.85% for an upgrade to BBB Baa2: or LIBOR plus 0.75% for an upgrade to BBB Baa1 or higher.
In addition when in excess of 33% of the facility is utilised an additional fee of 0.2% on the total amount drawn is payable, this increases to 0.4% when in excess of 66% of the facility is utilised.
The new facility will mature on 11 May 2016.
250m 6.5% sterling bonds due 2016 Issued at 99.384% of par, the bonds pay an annual interest coupon of 6.5% on 23 November until maturity in 2016.
The effective interest rate is 6.71%.
The coupon of 6.5% would be increased by 1.25% in the event the Groups long term credit rating were to be reduced below investment grade by either Standard and Poors below BBBor Moodys below Baa3.
The Group entered into currency and interest rate swaps so that approximately 150m has been swapped into floating rate US dollars, at a rate of US LIBOR plus 3.14%.
The Group entered into currency swaps so that approximately 100m was swapped into fixed rate US dollars, at a rate of 6.34%: these swaps were repaid on 3 October 2012 to maintain an appropriate level of US dollar borrowings.
$350m 5.75% dollar bonds due 2020 The Group issued $350m fixed rate dollar bonds at 98.295% of par.
The bonds pay a 5.75% coupon on a semi annual basis on 3 May and 3 November until maturity in 2020.
The effective interest rate is 6.17%.
The coupon of 5.75% would be increased in the event the Groups long term credit rating were to be reduced below investment grade by either Standard and Poors below BBBor Moodys below Baa3.
The increase to the coupon would be 0.25% per ratings notch per agency.
The Group entered into interest rate swaps so that $150m of the bonds has been swapped into floating rate US dollars, at a rate of US LIBOR plus 2.63%.
On 3 October 2012, $50m of the interest rate swaps were dedesignated further details in Note 5.4.
102 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 5.4 Net financing expense This note details the interest income generated on the Groups financial assets and the interest expense incurred on borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.
In reporting adjusted earnings the Group adjusts net financing expense to exclude foreign exchange gains losses on forward contracts, ineffectiveness on hedges, other fair value movements and exceptional items.
Foreign exchange and fair value movements reflect the value of these instruments at a point in time, resulting in a variable impact on profit and loss.
Accounting policy Interest expense and interest income are calculated under the effective interest method.
As no interest is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to prepare for its intended use or, all interest expense is recognised as finance expense when incurred.

103 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Section 5: Capital structure and financial policy continued 5.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Accounting policy Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is measured by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is measured by reference to market rates of interest.
The Group enters into derivative contracts only and with which it has a lending relationship.
Put option arrangements Put option arrangements that allow non-controlling interest shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments.
The options are initially recognised at fair value within derivative financial liabilities, with a corresponding charge directly to equity.
The fair value is measured based on the present value of expected cash outflows which would be payable on exercise of the option.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised in the income statement within financing income expense.
Hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge risks and accounts for them as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction: or as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated.
For fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any fair value gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for the change in the fair value of the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified into profit or loss and out of other comprehensive income in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in profit or loss.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward exchange contracts are used as net investment hedges.
All foreign exchange gains or losses arising on translation of net investments are recognised in other comprehensive income and included in cumulative translation differences.
Foreign currency borrowings used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation are measured using the exchange rate at the reporting date.
The resulting gains or losses are taken to other comprehensive income to the extent that they are effective, with any ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss.
Forward exchange contracts used to hedge a net investment hedge are measured at fair value at the reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income are retained until the forecast transaction occurs, when they are transferred to profit or loss.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss.

Until October 2012, under two US dollar cross currency interest rate swap contracts totalling $166.7m, the Group paid annual interest of 6.336% and received annual interest of 6.5% on 100m.
Upon maturity of the Japanese yen forward exchange contracts in January 2011, the Group received 15.4m and paid 1,940.0m.
These hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2012 and 2011 with the ineffective portion of the hedging contracts transferred to financing expense Note 5.4.

Under these swaps the Group receives 6.50% and 5.75% respectively to match the bond coupons and pays six month sterling LIBOR plus 2.90% and six month US LIBOR plus an average of 2.63% respectively.
The interest rate swaps are used to increase the Groups exposure to interest rates to maintain a balance of fixed and floating interest rate cost.
The hedges were assessed to be highly effective at 31 December 2012 and 2011 with the ineffective portions of the hedging contracts included in financing expense.
At 31 December 2011 and until 3 October 2012 there were also floating rate swaps in place for a further $50m matched against $50m of the $350m dollar bonds due 2020.
The terms were the same as above.
On 3 October 2012, the Group ceased fair value hedge accounting for this $50m portion of the bond, resulting in an exceptional financing gain of 4.0m Note 5.4.

These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.
The fair values of put options over non-controlling interests including exercise price and contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions are measured using discounted cash flows models with inputs derived from the projected financial performance in relation to the specific contingent consideration criteria for each acquisition, as no observable market data is available.
The terms of instruments granted during 2012 and 2011 are detailed in Note 6.1.
The fair value of the 53.1m floating rate reset loan was measured by external counterparties to the debt.
The fair value of the 250m 6.5% sterling bonds due 2016 and the $350m 5.75% dollar bonds due 2020 have been measured at market value.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities do not differ from their carrying amounts.
Fair value hierarchy The fair value measurements at the reporting date are classified according to the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
The level in the hierarchy within which the fair value is categorised is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly e. g. prices or indirectly e. g. derived from prices.
Level 3: inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
The following table shows the level in the hierarchy for fair value measurements included in the statement of financial position.

Shareholders who held 50,000 or fewer shares i on the date of admission of the Companys shares to the London Stock Exchange and ii in the case of shareholders who did not own the shares at that time, on the first dividend record date after they become shareholders in the Company, unless they elect otherwise, will be deemed to have elected to receive their dividends under the DAP arrangements.
Shareholders who hold more than 50,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make a DAP election.
All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made a DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends will be received from an Irish source and will be taxed accordingly.
Following the return of the Company to the UK on 30 November 2012, the DAP will no longer be required.
There are no income tax consequences to the Group arising from the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.

Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record entries in relation to certain reorganisations that took place in previous accounting periods.
The majority of the balance on the reserve relates to the capital reorganisation that took place in 2008 which created a new holding company which is UK-listed, incorporated in Jersey and with its tax residence in the Republic of Ireland.
The return of the Companys tax residency to the United Kingdom has had no impact on these balances.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
It is also used to record the effect of hedging net investments of foreign operations.
Of this balance a gain of 24.9m will be recycled to the income statement in 2013 on completion of the disposal of the Delta businesses as disclosed in Note 6.4.
ESOP reserve The ESOP reserve records ordinary shares held by the ESOP to satisfy future share awards.

Further details of the Groups strategy are provided in the Business and strategic review on pages 10 to 33.
The Group completed ten acquisitions in 2012 none of which were individually significant 2011: eight acquisitions of which International Business Events Limited, owner of the Ecobuild exhibition business, Ecobuild was significant.
Details of acquisitions have been provided in aggregate in the table below.
Note 6.2 provides details of equity transactions which are those acquisitions where the Group already held control prior to the transaction.
Accounting policy The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations.

On an  basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value under the full goodwill method or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.

A disposal group consists of assets that are to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, in a single transaction together with the directly associated liabilities.
Goodwill arising from business combinations is included for cash generating units which are part of the disposal group.
On initial classification as held for sale, non-current assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Any impairment on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis.
Impairment on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment.
No amortisation or depreciation is charged on non-current assets including those in disposal groups classified as held for sale.
Assets classified as held for sale are disclosed separately on the face of the statement of financial position and classified as current assets or liabilities, with disposal groups being separated between assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale.

The defined benefit pension schemes included in the following disclosures are: UK schemes: the United Pension Plan UPP, the United Magazines Final Salary Scheme UMFSS, the defined benefit section of the United Group Pension Scheme UGPS and the United Newspapers Executive Pension Scheme UNEPS : US schemes: the CMP Media LLC Cash Balance Retirement Plan and the CMP Post Retirement Medical Plan: and Retirement Indemnity Plans in France.
Accounting policy For the defined contribution schemes, the contributions paid or payable in respect of employee service rendered during the accounting period are recognised as an expense in that period.
For the defined benefit pension schemes, the liability for the benefits earned by employees in return for service rendered in the current and prior periods is determined using the projected unit credit method as determined annually by qualified actuaries.
This is based upon a number of assumptions, the determination of which is significant to the valuation.
The following are charged to operating profit: the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities arising from employee service in the current period current service cost : the increase in the present value of pension scheme liabilities as a result of benefit improvements over the period during which such improvements vest past service cost : and gains and losses arising on settlements curtailments.
The expected return on the schemes' assets and interest resulting from the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes' liabilities are recognised in the income statement as Pension schemes net finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
121 UBM plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Section 7: Employee benefits continued 7.2 Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit pension surpluses are recognised when scheme rules indicate that such surpluses are recoverable as either an unconditional right to refund if the scheme were to be wound up or reductions in future contributions.
The availability of refunds or reductions of future contributions takes into account any minimum funding requirement of the UK defined benefit schemes.
Any tax expense arising on refunds is deducted from any surplus recognised.
Any gains or losses arising on the recognition of defined benefit plan surpluses or adjustments to such surpluses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Future changes to accounting standards From 1 January 2013, the Group will apply IAS 19 Employee benefits amended 2011 which will reduce the return on plan assets included in pension scheme finance income and reduce the actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income by the same amount.
The effect of this amendment for 2013 is currently expected to change the pension interest credit into an interest cost of 1.8m.
The current service cost is also expected to increase to 2.4m 2012: 0.7m.
Defined contribution schemes The expense for the year for defined contribution schemes was 4.2m 2011: 5.7m.
Defined benefit schemes The most recent actuarial funding valuations for the majority of the UK scheme liabilities were carried out in 2011 and updated to 31 December 2012 for accounting purposes by independent qualified actuaries.
Assumptions and sensitivities Principal actuarial assumptions used in determining pension obligations for the Groups schemes: UK Other UK Other Schemes Schemes Schemes Schemes 2012 2012 2011 2011 % % % % Discount rate 4.00 0.52 4.70 4.00 Future salary increases 3.75 n a 3.75 n a Weighted average pension increases 2.70 n a 2.73 n a Retail price inflation 2.50 2.50 2.60 2.50 Consumer price inflation 1.75 n a 1.85 n a Expected return on scheme assets: Equities 7.50 n a 7.50 9.50 Bonds 4.00 n a 4.70 5.50 Gilts 3.00 n a 3.00 n a Property 7.50 n a 7.50 n a Diversified growth funds 7.50 n a 7.50 n a Other 0.50 0.25 0.50 n a The discount rate has been based on available yields of AA rated corporate bonds of a similar duration to the scheme liabilities.
The inflation assumptions have been set by reference to the yield on the Bank of England implied inflation curve.
The mortality assumptions used at 31 December 2012 for UK schemes are consistent with those used for 31 December 2011.
The life expectancy rates used are 110% of the SAPS S1 tables based on the year of birth of scheme members, which is currently on average 1941 for pensioners and 1956 for non-pensioners.
Allowances for future improvements in mortality rates are in line with the CMI 2010 projections with a 0.75% p. a. long term trend rate.
These projections allow for life expectancy to improve over time due to improvements in medical treatments and other lifestyle factors such that younger members who have not yet reached pensionable age are expected to live longer than current pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 21.1 years for males and 23.3 years for females 2011: 21.1 years and 23.3 years respectively.
For current non-pensioner members aged 45, the assumed average life expectancy at age 65 is 22.1 years for males and 24.5 years for females 2011: 22.1 years and 24.5 years respectively.
The average rate of improvement underlying the standard tables is an increase of approximately 0.6 years life expectancy in every 10 years.
For the valuation of US scheme liabilities, RP 2000 tables projected using scale AA to 2019 2011: to 2015 are used in both years for all pensioner members.
The assumed average life expectancy of current pensioner members at age 65 is 19.1 years for males and 21.0 years for females 2011: 19.0 years and 20.9 years respectively.
Non-pensioner members are assumed to take cash lump sums at retirement.
Additional assumptions used for valuing the UK scheme liabilities are an allowance for all non-pensioners to take 15% of pension as tax free cash upon retirement 2011: 15%.
Plan assets mainly consist of equity instruments, gilts and diversified growth funds.
The expected rate of return on equities and diversified growth funds at 31 December 2012 are based on an expected long term out-performance of equities over government bonds of 4.5% p. a.
