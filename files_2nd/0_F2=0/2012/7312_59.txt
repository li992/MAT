UGANDA On 18 December 2009, Heritage announced that it and its wholly owned subsidiary HOGL, had entered into a SPA with Eni for the sale of the Ugandan Assets.
On 17 January 2010, Tullow exercised its rights of pre-emption.
The transaction was overwhelmingly approved by Heritage shareholders at the General Meeting on 25 January 2010.
On 27 July 2010, Heritage announced that HOGL had completed the disposal of the Ugandan Assets.
Tullow paid cash of $1.45 billion, including $100 million from a contractual settlement, of which Heritage received and retained $1.045 billion.
The URA contends that income tax is due on the capital gain arising on the disposal and it raised assessments of $404,925,000 prior to completion of the disposal.
Heritages position, based on comprehensive advice from leading legal and tax experts in Uganda, the United Kingdom and North America, is that no tax should be payable in Uganda on the disposal of the Ugandan Assets and that even if tax were payable, under the PSAs, HOGL should be indemnified by the Ugandan government under the contract stabilisation clause.
On closing, Heritage deposited $121,477,500 with the URA, representing 30% of the disputed tax assessment of $404,925,000.
$121,477,500 has been classied as a deposit in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012.
A further $283,447,000 has been retained in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London, pursuant to an agreement between HOGL, Tullow and Standard Chartered Bank pending resolution between the Ugandan government and HOGL of the tax dispute.
Including accrued interest, an amount of $286,915,000 2011 - $284,479,000 is classied as restricted cash in the balance sheet at 31 December 2012.
In August 2010, the URA issued a further income tax assessment of $30 million representing 30% of the additional contractual settlement amount of $100 million.
HOGL has challenged the Ugandan tax assessments on the disposal of HOGLs entire interest in the Ugandan Assets.
In November 2011 and December 2011, the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Uganda dismissed HOGLs applications in relation to the two assessments amounting to $434,925,000.
The rulings from the Tax Appeals Tribunal in Uganda are part of a domestic process and are not final and determinative.
HOGL has appealed the rulings, which it believes are fatally awed in many respects, through the Ugandan court system commencing with the High Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court if necessary.
