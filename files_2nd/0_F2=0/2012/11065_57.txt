However, the adopted IFRS criteria for finance lease cannot be met for land.
Amortisation of rights to use land Adopted IFRS does not provide a specific guideline for the presentation of such a relationship.
The Group decided to present this 453 323 776 776 divisional adjustment relationship in the segment analysis as a Right to use land Right granted by RED to the MD and RED has deferred revenue for Gain recognised on impairment granting the Right.
The management determined the original value of the Right being the book value of land at 31 December 2007.

It is replaced by the Right to use land in the accounts of the MD, Gain from sale of property, plant 59 10 69 36 105 amortisation of which is reflected in the result of the MD.
The Right is depleted over the expected lifetime of mining, coking and and equipment related businesses using a linear amortisation method.
Other operating income 2,811 526 624 38 3,923 297 4,220 When any building or construction is not needed by MD for its operating activities any more, the asset is transferred back to RED.
Other operating expenses 37,372 697 1,353 7 39,415 1 39,416 Since the respective buildings and construction are expected to be used for the major part of the economic life of the assets, they will generally be fully depreciated at the moment, when mining, coking and related operations stop in the future.
Therefore the transfer should include only fully depreciated assets with a zero book value.
IAS 16 assumes some residual value of assets SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME which should be equal to its estimated market value at the end of its useful life.
However the Company is unable to make a reliable 62,216 5,120 12,285 55,051 1,090 56,141 LOSS estimate of such residual value due to the character of the assets.
