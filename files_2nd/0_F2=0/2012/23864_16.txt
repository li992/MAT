Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2012 36 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, in January 2009. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust continues to be granted by HM Revenue and Customs.
A resolution proposing the continuation of the Company as an investment trust will be put to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 May 2013.
The Directors are recommending that shareholders vote in favour of this resolution.
In light of their recommendation and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
Accordingly the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may arise from a reconstruction or liquidation of the Company.
Such adjustments would include expenses of reconstruction or liquidation along with any costs associated with realising the portfolio.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Overseas dividends are stated gross of withholding tax.
UK dividends are stated at the amount actually receivable, which is net of the attaching tax credit.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is credited on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Derivative income from dividends on long CFDs is included in Income and recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of any performance fee which is charged wholly to the capital column, as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation Irrecoverable overseas withholding tax suffered is recognised at the same time as the income to which it relates.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the Balance Sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated to UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of those transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2012 37 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially, at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as follows: tJTUFE JOWFTUNFOUT BSF WBMVFE BU CJE QSJDFT PS MBTU NBSLFU QSJDFT EFQFOEJOH PO UIF DPOWFOUJPO PG UIF FYDIBOHF PO XIJDI they are listed, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: and t 6OMJTUFE JOWFTUNFOUT XIFSF UIFSF JT OPU BO BDUJWF NBSLFU BSF WBMVFE VTJOH BO BQQSPQSJBUF WBMVBUJPO UFDIOJRVF TP BT UP establish what the transaction price would have been at the Balance Sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains losses on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 44. h Derivative instruments Some of the Companys exposure to European equities is through the use of long CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.
CFDs are measured at fair value which is the difference between the settlement price of the contract and the fair value of the underlying shares in the contract, which is calculated in accordance with policy 1 g. Gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Gains on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received from dividends on long CFDs is included in Income and the finance costs are included in Finance costs, in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
i Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc The Company holds an investment in the Fidelity Liquidity Fund plc Euro Fund the Fund.
The Fund invests in low risk short term investments.
It is a distributing fund and accordingly the interest earned within the Fund is treated as income.

Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the Balance Sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
k Dividends In accordance with FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the Balance Sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the Balance Sheet date.

The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, and are summarised in this Note on pages 47 to 51.
MARKET PRICE RISK Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has a geared exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs which incur funding costs and provide collateral in Euros.
It is, therefore, exposed to a financial risk as a result of increases in Euro interest rates.

It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
LIQUIDITY RISK The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities and long CFDs, which can be sold easily to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
COUNTERPARTY RISK All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis function.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported frequently.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
CREDIT RISK Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are set on the amount that can be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and the CFDs at fair value.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the other risk categories disclosed in this Note on pages 47 to 50.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager to gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivative instruments team which draws on over forty years of specialist experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses sophisticated portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Investments exposure sensitivity analysis An increase of 10% in the fair value of investments at 31 December 2012 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 58,394,000 2011: 50,441,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in long CFDs to gain exposure to the equity markets.

Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis If the Companys exposures at 31 December 2012 to bank balances, including amounts held in the Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc, and long CFDs were held throughout the year, with all other variables held constant, then if interest rates increased by 0.25%, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by 167,000 2011: decrease 105,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.25% would have had an equal but opposite effect.

If the UK sterling exchange rate had strengthened the net impact would have been: 2012 2011 000 000 Danish krone 3,821 3,115 Euro 37,106 30,920 Norwegian krone 3,321 2,569 Swedish krona 2,871 3,187 Swiss franc 11,645 9,236 If the UK sterling exchange rate had weakened the net impact would have been: 2012 2011 000 000 Danish krone 4,670 3,807 Euro 43,352 37,791 Norwegian krone 4,059 3,140 Swedish krona 3,509 3,895 Swiss franc 14,233 11,289 FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Note 1 g and 1 h on page 38, investments are stated at fair value, which is bid or last market price, and long CFDs are stated at fair value, which is the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.
Other financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Under FRS 29 financial companies are required to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in Accounting Policies Note 1 g and 1 h on page 38.
All investments and derivative instruments held by the Company at 31 December 2012 are considered to fall within Level 1, with the exception of 13,701,000 2011: 3,109,000 of long CFDs which fall within Level 2.
