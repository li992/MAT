The chief operating decision maker has been identied as the executive directors.
The executive directors review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources, across each operating segment.
The operating segments are UK and International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations.
The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-underlying items from the operating segments.
Central costs are all classied as UK costs and presented within UK operating profit.
The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments, by subcategory.

On 21 March 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the main rate of corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012.
This change of rate became substantively enacted for the purposes of IAS 12 Income Taxes on 26 March 2012 when the House of Commons passed a resolution in respect of it under the provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
The Group has remeasured its UK deferred tax assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period at 24%, which has resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 13.3m in the income statement reducing the total effective tax rate by 2.0%, and the recognition of a deferred tax credit of 1.8m in other comprehensive income.
The Chancellor further stated his intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 and a further 1% reduction to 22% from 1 April 2014.
These changes have not been substantively enacted at the date of the statement of financial position.
Had these changes been enacted, then the cumulative effects would have been credits to the income statement of 19.9m 23% or 26.5m 22%, and credits to other comprehensive income of 2.7m 23% or 3.6m 22%.
Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The underlying earnings per share gures have also been calculated based on earnings before profits and losses on the disposal of properties, pension credits arising on changes to the dened benefit pension schemes, impairment charges, non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments, and costs relating to strategic changes that are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

11 Retirement benets The Group provides pension arrangements for the benefit of its UK employees through the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme.
This has a dened benefit section, which was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 April 2002, and a dened contribution section which has been open to new members with effect from 1 April 2003.
The dened benefit section operates on a final salary basis and at the year end had some 14,000 active members last year 15,000, 56,000 deferred members last year 56,000 and 51,000 pensioners last year 51,000.
At the year end, the dened contribution section had some 9,000 active members last year 9,000 and some 2,000 deferred members last year 2,000.
The Group also operates a small funded dened benefit pension scheme in the Republic of Ireland.
Retirement benets also include a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded retirement benets.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost of 32.1m last year 22.4m excluding a one-off pension credit of 10.7m, 12.0m last year 1.0m relates to the UK dened benefit section, 15.9m last year 14.3m to the UK dened contribution section and 4.2m last year 7.1m to other retirement benefit schemes.

Financial assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK Dened benefit Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2009 and showed a deficit of 1.3bn.
A funding plan of 800m was agreed with the Trustees.
The difference between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by investment returns on the existing assets of the pension scheme.
The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benets in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes and are as follows: 2012 2011 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service 2.3-3.1 2.4-3.4 Discount rate 4.6 5.5 Ination rate 3.1 3.4 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.1 7.4 The ination rate of 3.1% reects the Retail Price Index RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation certain benets have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price Index CPI as the inationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.1% last year 2.7% has been used.
Last year, the change from RPI to CPI for deferred revaluation was included in the results, resulting in a gain of approximately 170m, taken as an actuarial gain on the obligation.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 surplus would increase decrease by c. 110m last year 90m.
If the ination rate increased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would decrease by c. 75m and if the ination rate decreased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would increase by c. 65m.
C. Demographic assumptions Apart from cash commutation and post retirement mortality, the demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme performed as at 31 March 2009.
The allowance for cash commutation reects actual scheme experience.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2009 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The specic mortality rates used are based on the SAPS tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2012 2011 years years Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.1 22.0 females 23.4 23.4 Future pensioners at age 65 males 23.2 23.2 females 24.3 24.3 An increase of one year in the life expectancies would decrease the IAS 19 surplus by c. 200m.

As such, the partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group.
The Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership holds 1.5bn of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the exibility to substitute alternative properties.
The limited partnership interest held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 71.9m from the profits of the Partnership earned from rental income, discretionary at the instance of Marks and Spencer plc.
The discretionary right is exercisable if the Group does not pay a dividend or make any other form of return to its shareholders.
This is an equity instrument, disclosed within other reserves.
Since the Group has paid an interim dividend in relation to 2011 12, the associated distribution of 71.9m is payable to the Pension Scheme and has been recognised as a liability last year 71.9m, and is reected as reduction in other reserves.
When such reserves are no longer sufficient, this distribution will be charged to retained earnings.
The future value of total discretionary scheduled payments is approximately 719m last year 791m.
Under IAS 19, the partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued at 664.8m last year 656.0m.
For further details see note 11.
The market value of this non-quoted financial asset is measured based on the expected cash ows and benchmark asset-backed credit spreads.
As general partner, Marks and Spencer plc has a right of pre-emption in respect of a transfer by the Pension Scheme of its limited partnership interest to another party.
This allows the general partner to direct that, instead of transferring the limited partnership interest to such a party, the general partner can instead nominate the transferee.
In addition, the partnership agreement includes a clause such that, following a default event including the appointment of an administrator, liquidator, receiver or similar officer in respect of Marks and Spencer plc or Marks and Spencer Group plc or on a relevant change of law, the net present value of the outstanding distributions becomes payable to the Pension Scheme by the Scottish Limited Partnership at the option of the Pension Scheme.
On the basis of the expected cash ows associated with such an event, the related financial liability has been fair valued at nil.
On 21 May 2012 the terms of the Scottish Limited Partnership were changed.
13 Share-based payments The charge for share-based payments for the year was 32.5m last year 31.7m.
Of the total share-based payments charge, 15.0m last year 11.4m relates to the Save As You Earn Share Option scheme.
The remaining charge is spread over the other schemes.
Further details of the option and share schemes that the Group operates are provided in the Remuneration report on pages 59 to 60.
Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
HMRC rules limit the maximum amount saved to 250 per month.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the offer date.
The options may normally be exercised during the six month period after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the scheme.

Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 92 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Share-based payments continued The fair values of the options granted during the year have been calculated using the Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 2012 2011 3-year plan 3-year plan Grant date Nov 11 Nov 10 Share price at grant date 322p 399p Exercise price 258p 319p Option life in years 3 years 3 years Risk-free rate 0.5% 1.5% Expected volatility 31.4% 44.5% Expected dividend yield 5.4% 4.0% Fair value of option 67p 125p Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the Companys share price over a three year period.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that 15% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Group.
Performance Share Plan The Performance Share Plan is the primary long-term incentive plan for approximately 100 of the most senior managers and was first approved by shareholders in 2005.
Under the plan, annual awards, based on a percentage of salary, may be offered.
The extent to which the awards vest is based on adjusted underlying basic earnings per share growth over three years.
The value of any dividends earned on the vested shares during the three years will also be paid on vesting.
Further details are set out in the Remuneration report on page 59.
Awards under this scheme have been made in each year since 2005.
During the year, 7,887,169 shares last year 7,788,119 were awarded under the plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 350.8p last year 342.2p.
C. Deferred Share Bonus Plan The Deferred Share Bonus Plan was introduced in 2005 06 as part of the Annual Bonus Scheme for approximately 450 of the most senior managers.
As part of the scheme, the managers are required to defer a proportion of any bonus paid into shares which will be held for three years.
There are no further performance conditions on these shares, other than continued employment, and the value of any dividends earned during the deferred period will be paid on vesting.
During the year, 2,366,847 shares last year 4,982,573 have been awarded under the Plan in relation to the annual bonus.
The fair value of the shares awarded was 378.4p last year 341.2p.
As at 31 March 2012, 6,396,018 shares last year 4,948,663 were outstanding under the scheme.
D. Restricted Share Plan The Restricted Share Plan was established in 2000 as part of the reward strategy for retention and recruitment of senior managers who are vital to the success of the business.
The Plan operates for senior managers below executive director level.
Awards under the Plan are made as part of ongoing reviews of reward packages, and for recruitment.
The shares are held in trust for a period of between one and three years, at which point they are released to the employee, subject to them still being in employment.
The value of any dividends earned during the restricted period will also be paid at the time of vesting.
During the year, 1,356,046 shares last year 651,000 have been awarded under the Plan.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded was 356.9p last year 355.2p.
Nil cost options For the purposes of calculating the number of nil cost options awarded, the share price used is the average of the mid-market price for the five consecutive dealing days preceding the grant date.
Overview Strategic review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 93 13 Share-based payments continued E. Republic of Ireland Save As You Earn Scheme Sharesave, the Companys Save As You Earn Scheme was introduced in 2009 to all employees in the Republic of Ireland for a ten year period, after approval by shareholders at the 2009 AGM.
The scheme is subject to Irish Revenue rules which limit the maximum monthly saving to 500 per month.
The Company chose in 2009 to set a monthly savings cap of 320 per month to align the maximum savings amount allowed within the UK scheme.
When the savings contract is started, options are granted to acquire the number of shares that the total savings will buy when the contract matures, at a discounted price set at the start of the scheme.
The price at which the options may be offered is 80% of the average mid-market price for three consecutive days preceding the offer date.
Options cannot normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed.
During the year, 97,270 last year 147,100 options were granted, at a fair value of 67.3p last year 124.9p.

These shares were acquired by the Trust in the market and are shown as a reduction in retained earnings in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The Trust used funds provided by Marks and Spencer plc to meet the Groups obligations.
Awards are granted to employees at the discretion of Marks and Spencer plc and shares awarded to employees by the Trust in accordance with the wishes of Marks and Spencer plc under senior executive share schemes.
Dividends are waived on all of these plans except for the Deferred Bonus Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan where dividends are paid via a Dividend Reinvestment Plan for awards made in the form of forfeitable shares.

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units CGUs which include the combined retail and wholesale businesses.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The pre-tax discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, towhich specic market-related premium adjustments are made: per una discount rate 10.6% last year 9.9%, Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. 16.2% last year 17.7%, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 12.3% last year 11.9% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited 12.7% last year 13.3%.
The valuations use cash ows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a three year period.
Cash ows beyond this three year period are extrapolated for Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. at a growth rate of 1.5% last year 2.0% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited at a growth rate of 1.5% last year 2.0%.
To stress test, nil growth has been assumed for per una and Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. These rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
Overview Strategic review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 95 14 Intangible assets continued Based on the above assumptions and due to the current economic environment in Greece and neighbouring countries, the Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. goodwill has been impaired in full giving rise to a charge of 34.4m.
This loss has been recognised within selling and administration expenses in the Income statement.
No other goodwill impairment charges have been recognised in 2011 12 last year nil.
If a zero per cent growth rate is assumed or the discount rate is increased by a pre-tax rate of 2.0%, per una, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited goodwill would not be impaired.
Brands consist of the per una brand cost of 80.0m and the M&S Mode brands which were purchased on 2 May 2011 for 32.4m.
The per una brand is a definite life intangible asset and is amortised on a straight line basis over a period of 15 years and is only assessed for impairment where such indicators exist.
The M&S Mode brands have been attributed an indefinite life as they give the Group the future right to use the M&S brand across Europe.
This is consistent with the Groups expansion plans in Europe and existing M&S brand recognition from its current presence.

Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is five years last year six years and 125 years last year 125 years for property.
Interest rates are xed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a xed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
21 Financial instruments Treasury policy The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
The Group treasury function also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and nancing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 98 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations at a reasonable price as they fall due: The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering exibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are nanced by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.325bn set to mature on 29 September 2016.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 105m last year 105m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of nil last year nil was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year nil was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.6bn last year 1.6bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
The 6.375% 308m bond was repaid in November 2011 and a new 6.125% 300m bond was subsequently issued under the programme in December 2011 maturing in 2021.
The present value of finance lease liabilities is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Within one year 8.7 12.4 Later than one year and not later than five years 8.7 17.3 Later than five years 48.1 48.6 Total 65.5 78.3 b Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings A A1 or better, assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved by exception by the CFO.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.

3 Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to treasury policy.
4 Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 115m last year 98m, other receivables 58m last year 61m, cash and cash equivalents 196m last year 470m and derivatives 111m last year 40m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate, hedge cover can be taken out longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash ow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in comprehensive income.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables, then associated fair value movements previously recognised in comprehensive income are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 1,221m last year 1,062m with a weighted average maturity date of seven months last year six months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 March 2012 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 15 months last year 14 months from the balance sheet date.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
As at the balance sheet date 242m last year 201m and HK$291m last year HK$192m of derivatives was hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 187m last year 175m.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities excluding short-term payables, the liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme and the Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. put option, is set out below: 2012 2011 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 2,030.4 205.2 2,235.6 2,030.1 411.8 2,441.9 Euro 6.8 5.1 11.9 7.1 33.7 40.8 Hong Kong dollar Other 28.3 28.3 43.7 43.7 2,037.2 238.6 2,275.8 2,037.2 489.2 2,526.4 Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 100 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments continued The oating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and three months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the xed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.8% last year 5.9% and the weighted average time for which the rate is xed is nine years last year nine years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to sterling, US dollar, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of xed and oating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date, xed rate borrowings amounted to 2,037.2m last year 2,037.2m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 90% last year 81% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2012 2011 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 0.5 Medium-term notes 5.8 5.9 Finance leases 4.5 4.6 Derivative financial instruments 2012 2011 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Options held for trading 53.6 53.6 14.4 14.4 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 13.3 5.1 2.8 29.9 held for trading 0.1 1.3 1.2 2.4 net investment hedges 0.5 2.7 Interest rate swaps held for trading 1.3 67.0 60.5 18.4 50.7 Non-current Cross currency swaps cash ow hedges 26.5 37.5 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash ow hedges 0.1 0.7 0.7 Interest rate swaps fair value hedge 24.0 0.8 Embedded derivative see note 5 20.1 20.3 44.2 27.2 21.8 37.5 The amounts reported as options held for trading in derivatives assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the call option with the puttable callable reset notes mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
The Group holds a number of interest rate swaps to re-designate its sterling xed debt to oating debt.
These are reported as fair value hedges.
The Group also holds a number of cross currency swaps to re-designate its xed rate US dollar debt to xed rate sterling debt.
These are reported as cash ow hedges.
Overview Strategic review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Financial statements Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2012 101 21 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to the Groups financial instruments.
The Directors consider that a 2% - last year 2% movement in interest rates and a 20% - last year 20% weakening in sterling represents a reasonable possible change.
However this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reects the effect on the Groups oating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact from foreign exchange movements reects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash ow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the re-translation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

Unlisted equity investments are included in Level 3.
The fair value of embedded derivatives is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on financial forecasts.
The nature of the valuation techniques and the judgement around the inputs mean that a change in assumptions could result in significant change in the fair value of the instrument.
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Trading derivatives 53.7 53.7 15.6 15.6 Derivatives used for hedging 37.4 37.4 4.3 4.3 Embedded derivatives note 5 20.1 20.1 20.3 20.3 Available-for-sale financial assets equity securities 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Trading derivatives 54.9 54.9 18.1 18.1 Derivative used for hedging 32.8 32.8 70.1 70.1 Put option over non-controlling interest 14.6 14.6 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements in the current or prior years.

A discount unwind on the put option of 1.0m last year 5.4m has been recorded within underlying interest charges, with the fair value movement of the put option of 15.6m last year 54.3m and the fair value movement of the embedded derivative of 0.2m treated as adjustment to reported profit see note 5.
Fair value of financial instruments With the exception of the Groups xed rate bond debt, there were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of the Groups xed rate bond debt was 2,171.6m last year 2,159.0m : the fair value of this debt was 2,121.7m last year 2,080.1m.
Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and exibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash ow to net debt see note 27 and xed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition, the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced long-term debt maturity prole.
As at the balance sheet date the Groups average debt maturity prole was nine years last year nine years.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poors.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

Subsidiaries Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries are disclosed in the Companys separate financial statements.
On 30 March 2012 the Group acquired the remaining 50 per cent shareholding of Marks & Spencer Marinopoulos BV for 1, taking its share in the Balkan states Greece, Romania, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro to 100 per cent.
At the same time, the Group sold 20 per cent of the share capital of Marks & Spencer Greece SA Greece to Marinopolous Holding Sarl for 1, leaving the Groups effective share in Greece at 80 per cent.

The fair value of the put option at 31 March 2012 was nil.
On an undiscounted basis this liability has a value of nil.
Both of these transactions have been accounted for through equity, as the Group already controlled these entities and consolidated them as subsidiaries.

29 Events after the reporting period On 21 May 2012 the Group changed the terms of the Scottish Limited Partnership the Partnership to waive the Groups limited discretionary right over the annual distributions from the Partnership to the Pension Trustee.
These discretionary rights were agreed with our Trustee in 2009, the time of the last triennial valuation.
This change will not have any impact on the cash ows of the Group.
From 21 May 2012 this will result in a prospective change in the Groups accounting treatment.
The change will reect the fide-recognition of the related equity instrument and recognition of a financial liability.
The liability will initially be measured at fair value, representing the present value of the remaining ten years of distributions of 71.9m per annum.
The difference between the value of the derecognised equity instrument and the fair value of the liability will be recognised in equity, in accordance with IAS 32.
As a result of the change, the Groups reported net debt will include this liability, which at the end of financial year 2012 13 will have a value of 537m and the Groups interest charge will increase to reect the unwinding of the discount on the liability which, in financial year 2012 13, will be a charge of 17m.
Similarly the impact on the Groups net assets will be to reduce them by 551m.
The Groups obligations to the Pension Trustee remain unchanged and this will not have any material impact on the Groups credit rating.
In March 2009, conscious of the Groups obligations to the Pension Trustee and the Partnership which is a partnership between the Group and the Pension Trustee which holds a number of properties from which the Group trades and on which the Group pays rent to the Partnership, we amended the terms of the Partnership to reect a discretionary right agreed between the Group and the Trustee.
This right is such that in the circumstances when no ordinary dividend or other distribution is made to ordinary shareholders, the annual distribution of 71.9m from the Partnership to the Pension Trustee would not be obliged to be made.
The impact of this change was to reclassify 572m from debt to equity in March 2009, and to reduce the Groups interest charge by 33m in the financial year 2009 10.
The Audit Committee and the Board has consistently received accounting and legal advice supporting this accounting treatment.
There was no impact on the Groups ultimate obligation to the Pension Trustee and no impact on cash ows.
Following the publication of the 2009 Annual Report and Accounts, in February 2010 the Financial Reporting Review Panel FRRP wrote to the company in relation to the change in accounting treatment of the obligation to the Pension Trustee.
In the dialogue that followed, and has continued until the present time, the FRRP expressed a concern that in the circumstances of the Groups pension arrangement this discretion was not sufficient to support classication of the Partnership interest as a component of equity.
In the interest of bringing discussions with the FRRP to a close and given that the Group has a stated dividend policy and the Board continues to expect that future dividend payments and resulting Partnership distributions will be made, the Group has decided that it will reect the obligation as a liability, and in order to achieve this will indefinitely waive its discretionary right.
As before, there is no change in the Groups ultimate obligation to the Pension Trustee.
The FRRP has confirmed that this change, with the consequent accounting treatment, effective from 21 May 2012, will bring its discussions with the Group to a close.
