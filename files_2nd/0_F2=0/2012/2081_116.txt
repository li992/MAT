Performance evaluation for executives The performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed on an annual basis.
For the members of the GMC, this review includes their contribution, engagement and interaction at Board level.
The annual performance review process that we employ considers the performance of executives against criteria designed to capture both what is achieved and how it is achieved.
All performance assessments of executives consider how effective they have been in undertaking their role: what they have achieved against their specified key performance indicators: how they match up to the behaviours prescribed in our leadership model and how those behaviours align with Our Charter values.
The assessment is therefore holistic and balances absolute achievement with the way performance has been delivered.
Progression within the Group is driven equally by personal leadership behaviours and capability to produce excellent results.
A performance evaluation as outlined above was conducted for all members of the GMC in FY2012.
For the CEO, the performance evaluation was led by the Chairman of the Board on behalf of all the Non-executive Directors, drawing on guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
