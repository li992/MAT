Financial Statements Notes 1 Basis of preparation and business environment The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation tothe Financial Statements: Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of derivative instruments.
International Financial Reporting Standards The Groups Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Companys Financial Statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
The result of the Company for the year is shown in Note 25.
Financial year end The current years Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2012 and the previous years Financial Statements are for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings Note 13 drawn up to 31December 2012.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
Intra-group transactions, including sales, profits, receivables and payables, have been eliminated on the Group consolidation.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the Financial Statements of the Company.
Functional and presentational currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
The US Dollar Pound Sterling exchange rate at 31 December 2012 was 1.62 2011: 1.55. significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty The Groups main accounting policies affecting its results of operations and financial condition are set out on pages 42 to 47.
Judgements and assumptions have been required by management in applying the Groups accounting policies in many areas.
Actual results may differ from the estimates calculated using these judgements and assumptions.
Key areas of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements are as follows: Warranties Pace provides product warranties for its products.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of a product before eld deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the eld.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
The level of warranty provision required is reviewed on a product by product basis and provisions adjusted accordingly in the light of actual performance.
Royalties Paces products incorporate third party technology, usually under licence.
Inadvertent actions may expose Pace to the risk of infringing third party intellectual property rights.
Potential claims can still be submitted many years after a product has been deployed.
Any such claims are always vigorously defended.
A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
Having taken legal advice, the Board considers that there are defences available that should mitigate the amounts being sought.
The Group will vigorously negotiate ordefend all claims but, in the absence of agreement, the amounts provided may prove to be different from the amounts at which the potential liabilities are nally settled.
The provision is based on the latest information available.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 41 Financial Statements Notes Continued 1 Basis of preparation and business environment continued significant judgements, key assumptions and estimation uncertainty continued Operating segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identied as the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has determined that, based on its current internal reporting framework and management structure, it has two reportable segments.
Such determination is necessarily judgemental in its nature and has been determined for the preparation of the Financial Statements.
The level of disclosure of segmental and other information is determined by such assessment.
Further details of the considerations made and the resulting disclosures are provided in Note 3 to the Financial Statements.
Intangible assets The Group business includes a significant element of research and development activity.
Under accounting standards, principally IAS 38 Intangible Assets, there is a requirement to capitalise and amortise development spend to match costs to expected benets from projects deemed to be commercially viable.
The application of this policy involves the ongoing consideration by management of the forecasted economic benefit from such projects compared to the level of capitalised costs, together with theselection of amortisation periods appropriate to the life of the associated revenues from the product.
Going concern The Group has borrowing facilities in place until March 2014.
At 31 December 2012 these are in the form of a $150 million term loan, which is subject to repayment through instalments of $37.5 million each, due every six months plus a final payment of $75 million, anda $150 million revolver credit facility.
These facilities are subject to financial performance covenants which the Group currently complies with.
The Group has prepared a financial and working capital forecast based upon trading assumptions and other short-term and medium-term plans.
The Group has sensitised these plans for a number of potential scenarios, including working capital management and revenue reduction and has concluded that the Group will continue to meet its financial performance covenants and will have adequate working capital available to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
2 Accounting policies Business combinations Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
The acquisition date is the date onwhich control is transferred to the acquirer.
Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.
Goodwill Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Initial measurement The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group to the previous owners of the acquiree and equity interests issued by the Group.
Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination.
If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and theacquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element isdeducted from the consideration transferred and recognised in other expenses.
A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The Group measures any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identiable net assets of the acquiree.
Transaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination such as nders fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.
42 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill continued Subsequent measurement Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity accounted investee.
As permitted by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRS, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 29 May 2004 date of transition toAdopted IFRS has been frozen at the UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually.
The Group performs its annual impairment review at the cash-generating unit level.
Other intangibles Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group, which have nite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation of other intangibles is done on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic lives of the particular asset categories as follows: Customer contracts and relationships threeten years Technology and patents oneten years Other three years Research and development expenditure All ongoing research expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Where a product is technically feasible, production and sales are intended, a market exists and sufficient resources are available to complete the project, development costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the product concerned from commercial launch.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The estimated useful lives for development expenditure are estimated to be in a range of between six and thirty months.
Capitalised development expenditure is not treated as a realised loss for the purpose of determining the Companys distributable profits as the costs meet the conditions required to be treated as an asset in accordance with IAS 38.
The amortisation of capitalised development expenditure is charged to the income statement in research and development expenditure within the Administrative expenses category.
Impairment charges The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset or CGU.
For the purpose of impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reects the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups corporate assets do not generate separate cash inows and are utilised by more than one CGU.
Corporate assets are allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the CGU to which the corporate asset is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
Any impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the assets in the CGU on a pro rata basis.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 43 Financial Statements Notes Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Impairment charges continued An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists.
An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
Exceptional items Items which are significant by virtue of their size or nature and which are considered non-recurring are classied as exceptional operating items.
Such items which include for instance the costs of opening or closing premises, costs of significant restructuring and profits and losses made on the disposal of properties, are included within the appropriate consolidated income statement category, albeit analysed as a separate line within that category, and are highlighted separately in the Notes to the Financial Statements.
Exceptional operating items are excluded from the profit measures used by the Board to monitor underlying performance.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the value of sales of goods and services to third party customers occurring in the period, stated exclusive ofvalue added tax and net of trade discounts and rebates.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when substantially all of the risks and rewards in the product have passed to the customer and substantially all of the Groups work is completed, which is usually upon delivery to the customer or his agent.
Revenue in respect of services rendered, including engineering consultancy and support and software services, is recognised over the period over which they are performed, in relation to the level of work undertaken, project milestones achieved and any future obligations remaining.
When a single sales transaction requires the delivery of more than one product or service multiple components, the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the separately identiable components.
A component is considered to be separately identiable if the product or service delivered has standalone value to that customer and the fair value associated with the product or service can be measured reliably.
The amount recognised as revenue for each component is the fair value of the element in relation to the fair value of the arrangement as a whole.
This requires a degree of management judgement and the fair value allocations are, by their nature, best estimates.
The timing and amount of revenue recognition can vary depending on what assessments have been made.
Where there is no separate selling price of an element, management determines fair value based on equivalent available products.
The Group does not recognise revenue before delivery has occurred, the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred tothe customer, the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
The determination of whether the amount of revenue can be measured reliably or whether receivables are collectible is .
Finance income and finance costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues inprot or loss, using the effective interest method.
Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings and impairment losses recognised on financial assets.
Borrowing costs that are not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production ofaqualifying asset are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Government grants Grants in respect of specic research and development projects are credited to research and development costs within the income statement or against the capitalised development expenditure as appropriate to match to the projects related expenditure.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management system are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
Allowance for doubtful debts Trade receivables are assessed individually for impairment, or collectively where the receivables are not individually significant.
Where necessary, provisions for doubtful debts are recorded in the income statement.
44 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 2 Accounting policies continued Inventory Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in-first-out basis and includes appropriate transport and handling costs but excludes royalties due only on ultimate sale.
Where necessary, provision is made forobsolete, slow-moving and defective inventory.
Property, plant and equipment The cost of items of property, plant and equipment is its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off, on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic lives of the asset concerned, the cost of property, plant and equipment, less any estimated residual values, which are adjusted, if appropriate, ateach balance sheet date.
The principal economic lives used for this purpose are: Long leasehold properties Period of lease Short leasehold properties Period of lease Plant and machinery Oneten years Motor vehicles Four years Provision is made against the carrying value of items of property, plant and equipment where an impairment in value is deemed tohave occurred.
Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The interest element of leasing payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and ischarged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases and the payments made under them are charged to the income statement onastraight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising ontranslation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Groups presentational currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are taken directly to the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of such that control is lost, the cumulative amount in the translation reserve is reclassied to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, usually forward foreign exchange contracts, to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The directors have determined that the instruments qualify for cash ow hedge accounting.
Derivative financial instruments are classied as cash ow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to variability in cash ows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 45 Financial Statements Notes Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives are reviewed quarterly for effectiveness.
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash ows of a recognised asset or liability, or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the movement in fair value of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
The gain or loss on any ineffective part of the hedge is immediately recognised in the income statement within finance income costs.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or liability, the associated cumulative gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassied into the income statement when the transaction occurs.
Taxes Current tax, including UK Corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using thetax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing where relevant for temporary differences between thecarrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date andareexpected to apply when the asset is realised or the liability settled.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the temporary differences can be deducted.
Share-based payments The grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
For share-based payment awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based payment is measured to reect such conditions and there is no true-up fordifferences between expected and actual outcomes.
The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled topayment.
The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as personnel expenses in profit or loss.
Employee share ownership plans The material assets, liabilities, income and costs of the Pace plc Employee Benets Trust are treated as being those of the Company.
Until such time as the Companys own shares vest unconditionally with employees, the consideration paid for the shares is deducted in arriving at equity.
Employee benets Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement asincurred.
The Group has no dened benefit arrangements in place.
Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Dividends payable Distributions to equity holders are disclosed as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
A liability is recorded for a final dividend when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders and, for an interim dividend, when the dividend is paid.
46 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 2 Accounting policies continued Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
a Royalties A provision for royalties is recognised where the owners of patents covering technology allegedly used by the Group have indicated claims for royalties relating to the Groups use including past usage of that technology.
b Warranties A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
c Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
d Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benets to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
e Deferred consideration A provision is recognised for deferred consideration relating to acquisitions, based on the expected fair value of the outow.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures a New and amended standards adopted by the Group There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1January 2012 that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
b New standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not effective for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 andnotearly adopted IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income requires an entity to present the items of other comprehensive income that may be recycled to profit or loss in the future if certain conditions are met, separately from those that would never berecycled to profit or loss.
The Group is yet to assess IAS 1s full impact and intends to adopt IAS 1 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 July 2012, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IAS 19 Employee Benets was amended in June 2011.
The amendment does not impact the Group.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated Financial Statements of the parent Company.
The Group isyet to assess IFRS 10s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 10 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1January 2014, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interest in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 12s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 12 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2014, subject to endorsement by the EU.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement aims to improve consistency and reduce complexity by providing a precise denition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRS.
The Group is yet to assess IFRS 13s full impact and intends to adopt IFRS 13 no later than the accounting period beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to endorsement by the EU.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 47 Financial Statements Notes Continued 3 Segmental analysis In accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the chief operating decision-maker CODM has been identied as the Board ofDirectors which reviews internal monthly management reports, budget and forecast information to evaluate the performance ofthe business and make decisions.
The Group determines operating segments on the basis of SBU areas, being the basis on which the Group manages its worldwide interests.
During the year the Group consolidated Pace Europe, Pace Enterprise and certain other immaterial operating segments into a new SBU named Pace International.
This was done in order to reect the management structure of those operating segments, which changed in the year.
The Group has the following reportable segments: Pace Americas: Pace International: and O ther.
Other include central and unallocated costs and other immaterial SBUs, which are operating segments that are allowed to be aggregated under IFRS 8.
Reconciliations between Pace Americas, Pace International and the geographical revenue disclosure given are not possible duetothe different revenue streams which sit under each reportable segment.
Performance is measured based on segmental adjusted EBITA, as included in the internal management information which is reviewed by the CODM.
Adjusted EBITA is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments, relative to other entities that operate within these industries.
Revenues disclosed below materially represent revenues to external customers and, where appropriate, pricing is determined onan arms length basis.
There are no material inter-segment transactions.

Areduction to the Corporation tax rate has been announced and is expected to be enacted subsequently to reduce the rate by2% per annum to 21%, effective 1 April 2014.
This change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, is not recognised in these Financial Statements.

The carrying amount of goodwill is allocated across cash-generating units CGUs as follows: $121.0 million within Pace International: $191.2 million within Pace Americas: and $25.7 million within Latens.
54 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 11 Intangible assets continued Goodwill continued These CGUs are independent sources of income streams and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of CGUs is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on the following years budget and the Groups 3 year plan.
These forecasts have been approved by the Board, and have an appropriate long-term growth rate of 1% 2011: 1% applied to them.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash ow forecasts are discounted back to present value using an appropriate market-based discount rate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value in use was 10.14% 2011: 9.55%.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, sales growth rates and expected changes toselling prices and direct costs.
Sales growth, selling prices and direct costs are built up within the budget and 3 year plan on a product by product basis utilising the knowledge and expertise of operational staff.
The anticipated launch dates for new products, the achievable prices and direct costs to be incurred are therefore highly judgemental.
The directors estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments ofthe time value of money for the Group.
The Directors have reviewed the recoverable amounts of the CGUs and have also considered the following reasonable changes inthe assumptions: movements in the pre-tax discount rate of up to an additional 10%: and reductions in cash ows of up to $10 million per annum.
The Directors consider that there is sufficient headroom within the value in use calculations at 31 December 2012.
Other intangibles Other intangibles relate to trademarks and licence agreements, customer contracts and relationships recognised as part oftheacquisition of Pace France, 2Wire, Bewan and Latens.

These asset classes have now been extended from a previous useful economic life of 1 to 3 years depending on the asset class, to a revised useful economic life of 2 to 5 years.
The directors believe that this change better reects the manner in which these assets will be used by the business.
The effect of this change has been a reduction in the current year depreciation charge in comparison to prior periods.
The depreciation charge in each period going forward will be lower as a result but the effect on future periods has not been disclosed due the number of assets involved and the range of remaining useful economic lives.

d Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade debtors.
Credit risk is managed by monitoring the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one customer depending upon their credit rating.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
There were no significant impairments in the periods under review.
64 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 19 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued d Credit risk continued Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2012 2011 Carrying amount $m $m Trade receivables 514.1 369.8 Cash and cash equivalents 74.7 48.7 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Assets 0.4 4.8 589.2 423.3 The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2012 2011 Carrying amount $m $m Domestic 121.6 94.9 Euro-zone countries 24.0 24.0 United States 293.2 195.1 Other regions 75.3 55.8 514.1 369.8 The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
At each balance sheet date there was no significant concentration of credit risk, other than those customers with revenues in excess of 10% of the Groups total revenues, as explained in Note 3.
Of the trade receivables at 31 December 2012, 92% were within terms 2011: 94%.
Of the balance 7% were less than 30 days past due, with the remaining amounts over 30 days due 2011: 4% less than 30 days past due.
There were no material bad debts provisions deemed necessary against such balances, in the current or preceding years.
e Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 65 Financial Statements Notes Continued 19 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued e Liquidity risk continued The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the impact of netting arrangements: Carrying Contractual 6 months 612 12 23 34 amount cash ows or less months years years years $m $m $m $m $m $m $m At 31 December 2012: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 631.8 631.8 631.8 External borrowings 238.0 247.8 40.3 39.9 167.6 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outow 1.3 124.1 82.7 41.4 Inow 122.8 81.7 41.1 Total 868.5 880.9 673.1 40.2 167.6 At 31 December 2011: Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables within one year 373.5 373.5 373.5 External borrowings 370.4 393.6 42.6 42.0 82.5 226.5 Deferred consideration 15.7 15.7 15.7 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts used for hedging Outow 207.4 128.8 78.6 Inow 4.5 211.9 131.3 80.6 Total 764.1 778.3 429.3 40.0 82.5 226.5 It is not expected that the cash ows included in the maturity analysis could occur signicantly earlier, or at signicantly different amounts.
The directors have considered the periods in which the cash ows associated with derivatives that are cash ow hedges are expected to occur, together with the timing of impact on profit or loss, and have determined that the timings are as disclosed in the above table.
f Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term uctuations on the Groups earnings.
The directors consider that a change of 100 basis points in interest rates during a twelve-month period would have a $0.8 million impact on cash ows 2011: $0.9 million.
The Groups key foreign exchange exposures are in respect of the Euro and Sterling.
A 1% strengthening in the US Dollar against these would have an adverse impact of $0.2 million 2011: $0.9 million on the profit reported in the year ended 31 December 2012 and an adverse impact of $4.7 million 2011: $4.4 million on equity.

Negotiations over these liabilities continue for long periods of time.
The directors have made provision for the potential royalties payable based on the latest information available.
Given the nature of the claims it is not possible to be more specic with regard to the timing of outows.
68 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Pace plc 20 Provisions continued Royalties under negotiation continued The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the negotiation of royalty claims during the year would be seriously prejudicial to other royalty claims under negotiation, in litigation or dispute.
Accordingly the directors have aggregated amounts released unused with additional provisions made in order to arrive at the net charge for the year shown on page 68.
Other provisions Other provisions mainly relate to retirement and exceptional restructuring provisions within the Group, along with certain other provisions.
Warranties Pace provides product warranties for its STBs and Gateways from the point of sale and a provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data, principally historical failure rates and related cost of repair information and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Although it is difficult to make accurate predictions of potential failure rates or the possibility of an epidemic failure, as a warranty estimate must be calculated at the outset of product shipment before eld deployment data is available, these estimates improve during the lifetime of the product in the eld.
The directors consider that to disclose the amounts unused following the settlement of warranty claims during the year would be seriously prejudicial to other claims under negotiation.
It is expected that the expenditure with regard to warranties will be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
