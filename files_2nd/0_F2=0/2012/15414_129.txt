Some of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
In the United Kingdom, the most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out as at 31 March 2010 by independent actuaries, and the results of these valuations have been finalised and a recovery plan is in place which addresses the deficit.
This resulted in an additional 45 million paid into the main UK pension scheme in the year.
On 1 April 2002, the main United Kingdom scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new United Kingdom employees.
From 6 April 2011, the main United Kingdom Pension Scheme closed to future accruals.
The Group closed its largest US defined benefit arrangement, the Salaried Plan, to future accrual from 1 January 2011 and the remaining defined benefit arrangement, the Hourly Plan, is closed to new members.
The Groups subsidiaries in the US provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 45 million to its defined benefit plans in the year to 31 March 2013. b Principal assumptions The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2012 UK US Other benefits Inflation rate 2.3 3.3% 2.5% 2.0% 2.5% Expected rate of salary increases n a 3.5% 2.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 3.3% n a 0.9% n a Discount rate 5.1% 4.4% 3.9% 4.1% Expected return on plan assets total 6.3% 7.1% 5.4% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 7.7% 8.0% 7.1% n a Tate & Lyle PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 102 Financial Statements 30 Retirement benefit obligations continued Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2011 UK US Other benefits Inflation rate 2.6 3.6% 2.5% 2.0% 2.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.4% 3.5% 2.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 3.4% n a 1.3% n a Discount rate 5.5% 5.4% 5.2% 5.3% Expected return on plan assets total 6.2% 7.2% 5.3% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 8.4% 8.0% 6.5% n a In accordance with the Scheme rules, both the Consumer Price Index CPI and Retail Price Index RPI inflation measures are used to value the Groups UK retirement benefit obligation.
