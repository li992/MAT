Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 73 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below.
Where accounting policies relate to a specic note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2012 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 113 to 116.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2012 but do not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for signicantly worse economic conditions.
The Board has also reviewed the Groups funding requirements and has taken into consideration the issuance of US$80m notes in February 2013 and the available debt facilities.
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described in note 14, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the non-controlling interests share of the assets and liabilities reected in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of acquisition, is reected directly in shareholders equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the policy on hedging of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
74 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Assets and liabilities Income and expenses Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31 Dec 2012 31 Dec 2011 2012 2011 US dollar 1.61 1.55 1.59 1.60 Euro 1.22 1.20 1.23 1.15 Chinese renminbi 10.12 9.77 10.01 10.35 Hong Kong dollar 12.46 12.04 12.31 12.47 Use of judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
Judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Judgement is applied when determining if the Group controls a subsidiary or associate.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the ability to control on a legal or contractual basis rather than whether that control is actually exercised: see above.
Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management determines whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill: see note 9.
Income tax The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid: see note 6.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income: see note 6.
Estimates Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment of goodwill The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired.
This requires an estimation of the future cash ows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated: see note 9.
Claims In making provision for claims, management bases its estimate on the circumstances relating to each specic event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents: see note 13.
Contingent consideration When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due: see note 13.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 75 1 Significant accounting policies continued Employee post-retirement benefit obligations For material dened benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates: see note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables Trade receivables are reected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision considers the past payment history and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid: see note 11.
Accounting policies relating to a specic note in the financial statements are set out within that note as follows: Note Revenue 2 Separately disclosed items 3 Taxation 6 Property, plant and equipment 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets 9 Trade and other receivables 11 Trade and other payables 12 Provisions 13 Borrowings and financial instruments 14 Capital and reserves 15 Employee benets 16 Share schemes 17 Non-controlling interest 20 2 Operating segments and presentation of results Accounting policy Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered on short-term projects is generally recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued.
On long-term projects the Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade debtors if the customer has been invoiced or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract.
Operating segments The Group is organised into five divisions, each of which offer services to different industries and are managed separately: Industry & Assurance: Commodities: Consumer Goods: Commercial & Electrical and Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals.
The costs of the corporate head ofce and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions.
The divisions noted above are the operating segments that are reported to the Board of Directors, the chief operating decision maker, and are the Groups reportable segments.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There is no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The performance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is before separately disclosed items.
Unallocated items include group-wide projects that do not sit in any one division.
A reconciliation to operating profit by division, and Group profit for the year is included overleaf.
Principal activities are as follows: Industry & Assurance using in-depth knowledge of the oil, gas, nuclear, power, renewable energy, construction, food, chemical and agricultural industries, the division provides a diverse range of services to help customers meet global quality standards.

Income tax is recognised in the same primary statement as the accounting transaction to which it relates.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specic tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the outcome of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the period the determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: t Initial recognition of goodwill: t The initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and t Differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which is under the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
Tax expense The Group operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in which they occur.
The income tax expense for the total profit before tax for the year end 31 December 2012 is 68.4m 2011: 61.9m.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 26.7% 2011: 29.1%.
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 is 80.3m 2011: 73.3m.
The Groups adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31 December 2012 is 26.0% 2011: 28.2%.
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 26.7% and the notional statutory UK rate of 24.5% include, but are not limited to: the mix of profits, the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, the effect of utilised tax losses and under over provisions in previous periods.

The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
Further 1% reductions to the UK corporation tax rate were announced in the Budgets on 29 March 2011 and 21 March 2012.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 24% was enacted on 17 July 2012 and was effective from 1 April 2012.
The additional 1% reduction to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was enacted on the same date.

There is a temporary difference of 188.7m 2011: 174.7m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
No deferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other separately disclosed items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2012 2011 m m Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 173.8 138.8 Separately disclosed items after tax note 3 39.9 35.7 Adjusted earnings 213.7 174.5 Number of shares millions Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 160.6 159.9 Potentially dilutive share awards 2.3 2.9 Diluted weighted average number of shares 162.9 162.8 Basic earnings per share 108.2p 86.8p Potentially dilutive share awards 1.5 p 1.5 p Diluted earnings per share 106.7p 85.3p Adjusted basic earnings per share 133.1p 109.1p Potentially dilutive share awards 1.9 p 1.9 p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 131.2p 107.2p 84 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 8 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the income statement.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups statement of financial position.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, ttings, plant and equipment 3 10 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are reassessed at each reporting date.
Impairment Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 From 1 January 2010, the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in separately disclosed items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in profit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 87 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If, based on managements judgement, such an asset is identied, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash ows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have nite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software Up to 7 years Customer relationships Up to 10 years Know-how Up to 5 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset or cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiable cash ows a cash generating unit or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash ows.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other assets is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 89 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill arising from acquisitions in the current and prior year has been allocated to operating segments as follows: 2012 2011 m m Industry & Assurance 30.5 325.3 Commodities 6.1 0.1 Consumer Goods 3.4 3.2 Commercial & Electrical 0.4 Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals 1.1 0.1 At 31 December 41.1 328.3 The total carrying amount of goodwill by operating segment is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Industry & Assurance 433.2 406.7 Commodities 73.9 68.5 Consumer Goods 9.8 9.7 Commercial & Electrical 59.0 59.6 Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals 92.6 92.5 Net book value at 31 December 668.5 637.0 All goodwill is recorded in local currency.
Additions during the year are converted at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction and the goodwill at the end of the year is stated at closing exchange rates.
Impairment review The following table analyses the total Group goodwill of 668.5m between eight identied cash generating units CGUs.
2012 2011 m m Industry & Assurance Exploration and Production Services 20.0 20.2 Industry & Assurance Industry Services 352.6 325.3 Industry & Assurance Systems Certification 60.6 61.2 Commodities Minerals 49.0 43.3 Commodities Cargo and others 24.9 25.2 Consumer Goods 9.8 9.7 Commercial & Electrical 59.0 59.6 Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals 92.6 92.5 Total goodwill net book value at 31 December 668.5 637.0 In order to determine whether impairments are required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future cash ows over a five-year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity model which assumes long-term growth rates of operating cash ows of between 2.5% to 3.9% 2011: 2.5% to 3.9% reecting the long-term GDP growth forecasts in the various regions in which the respective CGUs operate.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount, unless the fair value less costs to sell the respective CGU is an amount in excess of the value in use.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
The approved Group Business Plans for the three years 2013 to 2015 form the basis for the cash ow projections for each CGU.
The cash ow projections for the succeeding two years 2016 to 2017 reect managements conservative expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGUs and growth prospects in the various CGUs markets and regions.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the revenue and operating margin growth rates which directly inuence the forecasted operating cash ows, as well as the discount rate applied.
In determining the key assumptions, management have taken into account the current economic climate and the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to the following key assumptions: Operating cash flow One of the key drivers of the operating cash ow is revenue.
The 2013 to 2015 revenues for each CGU are based on the approved business plans.
For the years 2016 and 2017, the likely organic growth rates were assessed for each region in the CGU, taking account of past experience and GDP growth prospects.
The compound annual growth rates for each CGU for the years 2013 to 2017 ranged from 7.4% to 13.0% 2011: 7.3% to 16.8%.
In all cases the assumed growth rates are considered to be realistic.
90 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The other key driver of the operating cash ow is operating profit.
The compound annual growth rates for each CGU for the years 2013 to 2017, which are considered realistic, ranged from 7.6% to 21.0% 2011: 6.8% to 23.9% reecting management assessment of current and future market environment of the sectors and countries in which the CGUs operate.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specic to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to the CGU were in the range of 8.5% to 11.1% 2011: 9.1% to 12.7%.
Sensitivity analysis There are no realistic changes that could be made to the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Management has also considered the effect of the following scenarios: i Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2014 to 2017 from the 2013 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with base assumptions, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
ii Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2014 to 2017, with revenues increasing per base assumptions, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
iii Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
Management considers that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
Impairment loss recognised in 2012 The impairment loss of 3.2m recorded in operating costs, under separately disclosed items, all relates to goodwill associated with the planned disposal of certain assets in Europe.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 93 11 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
Based on historic default rates, reecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specic circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides fully for all trade receivables over 12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specic trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable.
At that time the trade receivable is written off.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are analysed below: 2012 2011 m m Trade receivables 362.2 320.6 Other receivables 52.8 50.9 Prepayments and accrued income 87.4 71.1 Total trade and other receivables 502.4 442.6 Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for impairment losses of 16.7m 2011: 15.4m and are all expected to be recovered within 12 months.
Impairment on trade receivables charged as part of operating costs was 4.2m 2011: 6.1m.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their shortterm duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers who are internationally dispersed.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Under 3 months 306.4 272.0 Between 3 and 6 months 39.7 34.8 Between 6 and 12 months 20.3 17.1 Over 12 months 12.5 12.1 Gross trade receivables 378.9 336.0 Allowance for impairment 16.7 15.4 Trade receivables, net of allowance 362.2 320.6 Included in trade receivables under three months of 306.4m 2011: 272.0m are trade receivables of 163.5m 2011: 151.2m which are not yet due for payment under the Groups standard terms and conditions of sale.

The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 13 Provisions continued The provision for claims of 8.6m 2011: 6.1m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identied claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 22.
The other provision of 16.8m 2011: 10.5m includes restructuring provisions and onerous contracts.
The timing of the cash outow is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
14 Borrowings and financial instruments Financial instruments Accounting policy Net financing costs Net nancing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, net foreign exchange gains or losses, interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses including bad debt provision.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
Hedging Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has external borrowings denominated in foreign currencies which are used to hedge the net investment in its foreign operations.
96 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Impairment A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash ows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 99 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Financial risks Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interest rate and currency risk are set out below, in the Directors Report Financial Review that starts on page 22 and Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 47 to 49. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis.
The Groups credit risk is diversied due to the large number of entities, industries and regions that make up the Groups customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
At the reporting date this was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance note 11 362.2 320.6 Cash and cash equivalents 166.5 181.9 Total 528.7 502.5 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows: 2012 2011 m m Asia Pacific 109.0 90.8 Americas 113.4 105.7 Europe, Middle East and Africa 139.8 124.1 Total 362.2 320.6 Counterparty risk Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet its obligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group.
The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least A-.
The Group has existing banking relationships with a number of relationship banks that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration of credit risk.
Given the diverse geographic nature of the Groups activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank.
Therefore the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group.
It is also Group policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Intertek Group Treasury in the UK.
Given the controls in place, and based on a current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet itsobligations.
100 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.
The Groups policy is to: t Ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Groups operations: t Ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events: and t Avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of nancing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis and funds itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.
The following are the contractual cash ows of financial liabilities including interest for oating rate instruments, interest payments are based on the interest rate at 31 December 2012 : Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2012 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 716.4 868.1 18.8 5.7 40.0 499.8 303.8 Other loans 0.8 0.8 0.8 Trade payables note 12 46.2 46.2 43.3 2.9 763.4 915.1 62.1 9.4 40.0 499.8 303.8 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 1.0 122.9 120.9 2.0 Inflow 121.9 119.9 2.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Total 764.4 916.1 63.1 9.4 40.0 499.8 303.8 Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2011 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 760.4 871.3 13.5 44.8 135.4 499.4 178.2 Other loans 2.2 2.2 2.2 Trade payables note 12 52.7 52.7 51.8 0.9 815.3 926.2 65.3 45.7 137.6 499.4 178.2 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 73.0 73.0 Inflow 73.0 73.0 Total 815.3 926.2 65.3 45.7 137.6 499.4 178.2 Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability of the near term 12 month horizon interest expense.
Under the Groups Treasury policy, management may x the interest rates on up to 80% of the Groups debt portfolio for the period of the current and succeeding financial year.
The Groups debt portfolio beyond this period is to be managed within the range of a 30% 70% xed to oating rate ratio.
To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered appropriate.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 101 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Sensitivity At 31 December 2012, it is estimated that the impact on variable rate net debt of a general increase of 3% in interest rates would be a decrease in the Groups profit before tax of approximately 5.1m 2011: 9.4m.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to uctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate uctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency uctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency uctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash ows in various currencies.
The foreign currency proles of cash, trade receivables and payables at the reporting date were as follows: Carrying Chinese Hong Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar Euro currencies 2012 m m m m m m m Cash 166.5 17.1 24.8 55.3 3.3 6.3 59.7 Trade receivables note 11 362.2 44.7 93.4 33.1 9.2 39.4 142.4 Trade payables note 12 46.2 6.0 8.5 4.0 1.9 10.1 15.7 2011 Cash 181.9 17.4 17.3 66.2 6.8 5.8 68.4 Trade receivables note 11 320.6 35.9 92.0 28.0 9.5 38.2 117.0 Trade payables note 12 52.7 12.5 8.0 2.9 2.1 10.5 16.7 Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2012 was 707.7m 2011: 757.6m.
A foreign exchange gain of 25.4m 2011: loss of 21.5m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
Sensitivity It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2012 by approximately 15.4m 2011: 13.4m.

Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the oating interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the oating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
The fair value of the xed interest bearing loans and borrowings has been calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash ows discounted at the market rate at the reporting date.
Trade receivables and payables For trade receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reect the fair value.
All others are estimated as the present value of future cash ows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

16 Employee benefits Accounting policy Pension schemes Defined contribution plans A dened contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays xed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A dened benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a dened contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of dened benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
104 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements 16 Employee benefits continued In calculating the dened benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benets are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualied actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are dened contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant dened benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong were closed to new entrants in 2002 and 2000, respectively.
Other funded dened benefit schemes are not considered to be material and are therefore accounted for as if they were dened contribution schemes.
The Group recognises all actuarial gains and losses in each year in equity through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Total pension cost The total pension cost included in operating profit for the Group was: 2012 2011 m m Defined contribution schemes 29.9 26.8 Defined benefit schemes current service cost 2.7 2.4 Pension cost included in operating profit note 5 32.6 29.2 The pension cost for the dened benefit schemes was assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
The last full triennial actuarial valuation of The Intertek Pension Scheme in the United Kingdom was carried out as at 1 April 2010, but this has been updated to 31 December 2012 for IAS 19 purposes.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Hong Kong scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2011, for local accounting purposes but this has been updated to 31 December 2012 for IAS 19 purposes.
The Swiss scheme was actuarially valued for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December 2012.

The assumption for the annualised expected return on scheme assets in 2012 represents the discount rate.
In 2011 the expected rates of return on scheme assets was determined by reference to relevant indices which took into account the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of risk premium associated with equities and the expectation for future returns on such assets.
The overall expected rate of return was calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.

Since the amount of the lump sum is not related to the life expectancy of the member, the post-retirement mortality is not a relevant assumption for the Hong Kong Scheme.
The table above shows, for the United Kingdom Scheme, the number of years a male or female is expected to live, assuming they were aged either 40 or 65 at 31 December.
The mortality tables adopted in both 2012 and 2011 for the United Kingdom Scheme are the S1PA projected by year of birth, with an allowance for the medium cohort effect and a minimum improvement of 1%.
For the Swiss Scheme, the mortality table adopted for both 2012 and 2011 is the BVG 2010, an industry standard in Switzerland which is based on statistical evidence of major Swiss pension funds.

The fair value of the employee services, received in exchange for the grant of share options or shares, is measured at the grant date and is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The charge is calculated using the Monte Carlo method and expensed to the income statement over the vesting period of the relevant award.
The charge for the share options and for the share awards is adjusted to reect expected and actual levels of vesting where conditions are non-market based.
The expense of the Performance Awards previously Matching Awards, is also additionally adjusted for the probability of performance conditions being achieved.
The Group has taken advantage of the provisions of IFRS 1: First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, and has recognised an expense only in respect of share options and awards granted since 7 November 2002.
Share option schemes The Company established a share option scheme for senior management in March 1997.
The maximum number of options that can be granted under the scheme have been allocated and that scheme has been discontinued.
In May 2002, the Intertek Groupplc 2002 Share Option Plan the 2002 Plan and the Intertek Group plc 2002 Approved Share Option Plan the Approved Plan were established for employees to be granted share options at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
These plans have also been discontinued and the last grants under these plans were made in September 2005.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted Weighted average average exercise Number of exercise Number of price options price options At beginning of year 628p 285,264 631p 379,347 Exercised 594p 116,161 659p 72,839 Forfeited 533p 6,363 578p 21,244 Outstanding options at end of year 656p 162,740 628p 285,264 Exercisable at end of year 656p 162,740 628p 285,264 The weighted average share price of the Company at the date of exercise of share options was 2,532p 2011: 1,956p.
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 359p to 778p and a weighted average contractual life of 1.8 years.
The outstanding options at 31 December 2012 are exercisable as follows: Number of options Exercise price Option Scheme outstanding per share Exercisable between 2002 Plan 13,881 359p 7 April 2006 7 April 2013 1,432 462p 12 September 2006 12 September 2013 45,440 523.5p 7 April 2007 7 April 2014 2,400 607p 14 September 2007 14 September 2014 91,316 778p 7 April 2008 7 April 2015 154,469 Approved Plan 477 359p 7 April 2006 7 April 2013 262 462p 12 September 2006 12 September 2013 5,026 523.5p 7 April 2007 7 April 2014 2,506 778p 7 April 2008 7 April 2015 8,271 Total 162,740 Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 109 17 Share schemes continued Share Plans As explained in the Remuneration Report on page 51, the Deferred Bonus Plan 2005 was replaced in 2011 with the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan.
Share awards previously Deferred Awards and Performance Awards previously Matching Awards have been granted under this plan.
The first awards were granted on 7 April 2006.
The awards under these plans vest three years after grant date, subject to fullment of the performance conditions.
Of the 1,192,405 awards vested in 2012, 530,377 were satisfied by the issue of shares and 407,617 by the transfer of shares from the EBT see note 15.
The balance of 254,411 awards represented a tax liability of 5.8m which was settled in cash by the Group, of which 5.4m was settled by the Company.
Mirror share awards On 14 May 2010, Lloyd Pitchford was granted conditional rights to acquire 49,039 shares of 1p in Intertek Group plc under a one-off arrangement to facilitate his recruitment as Chief Financial officer of the Company.
At 31 December 2012, there were nil shares outstanding 2011: 9,899 shares.
Further details are shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 62.
Equity-settled transactions In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for shares granted to employees, is measured by reference to the fair value of shares granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Monte Carlo formula, a financial model used to calculate the fair value of shares and share options.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group recognised an expense of 10.4m 2011: 9.5m.
The fair values and the assumptions used in their calculations are set out below: Awards Performance Per formance Awards TSR Awards TSR Deferred Matching Share Awards element Share Awards element Awards Awards Year shares awarded 2012 2012 2011 2011 2010 2010 Fair value at measurement date pence 2,262 1,299 1,872 1,253 1,250 855 Share price pence 2,262 2,262 1,955 1,955 1,324 1,324 Expected volatility n a 25.2% n a 30.8% n a 30.8% Dividend yield 0% 0% 1.4% 1.4% 1.9% 1.9% Risk free interest rate n a 0.5% n a 1.4% n a 3.0% Time to maturity years 33 3333 The fair values and assumptions are also the same for the EPS element of the Performance awards.
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly availableinformation.
All Share Awards are granted under a service condition.
Such condition is not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
The Performance Awards TSR element are granted under a performance related market condition and as a result this condition is taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.

19 Capital management The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of Intertek: specically how much capital is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities.
These activities include ongoing operations as well as acquisitions as described in note 10.
The Groups policy is to maintain a robust capital base including cash and debt to ensure the market and key stakeholders retain confidence in the capital prole.
Debt capital is monitored by Group Treasury assessing the liquidity buffer on a short and longer-term basis as discussed in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of this Annual Report.
The Group uses KPIs, including return on invested capital and diluted adjusted earnings per share to monitor the capital position of the Group to ensure it is being utilised effectively.
The dividend policy also forms part of the Boards capital management policy, and the Board ensures there is appropriate earnings cover for the dividend proposed at both the interim and year end.
20 Non-controlling interest Accounting policy Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.
The purchase of non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Non-controlling interest An analysis of the movement in non-controlling interest is shown below: 2012 2011 m m At 1 January 24.0 23.1 Exchange adjustments 0.5 0.1 Share of profit for the year 14.4 12.3 Additions 0.3 Purchase of non-controlling interest 1.2 Dividends paid to non-controlling interest 12.6 10.4 At 31 December 25.3 24.0 In 2011, the Group purchased a non-controlling interest for cash consideration of 1.8m and recognised a decrease in a non-controlling interest of 1.2m and a decrease in retained earnings of 0.6m.
Intertek Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 111 21 Related parties Identity of related parties The Group has a related party relationship with its key management.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated on consolidation and are not discussed in this note.
Transactions with key management personnel Key management personnel compensation, including the Groups Directors, is shown in the table below: 2012 2011 m m Short-term benefits 5.9 5.9 Post-employment benefits 0.4 0.4 Equity-settled transactions 2.0 2.1 Total 8.3 8.4 More detailed information concerning Directors remuneration, shareholdings, pension entitlements, share options and other long-term incentive plans is shown in the audited part of the Remuneration Report.
Apart from the above, no member of key management had a personal interest in any business transactions of the Group.
22 Contingent liabilities 2012 2011 m m Guarantees, letters of credit and performance bonds 12.0 11.4 Litigation From time-to-time, the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business, including claims for damages, negligence and commercial disputes regarding inspection and testing, and disputes with employees and former employees.
The Group is not currently party to any legal proceedings other than ordinary litigation incidental to the conduct of business.
The outcome of litigation to which the Intertek Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen as in some cases the facts are unclear or further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
Tax The Group operates in more than 100 countries and is subject to a wide range of complex tax laws and regulations.
At any point in time it is normal for there to be a number of open years in any particular territory which may be subject to enquiry by local authorities.
Where the effect of the laws and regulations is unclear, estimates are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid on past profits which are recognised in the financial statements.
The Group considers the estimates, assumptions and judgements to be reasonable but this can involve complex issues which may take a number of years to resolve.
The final determination of prior year tax liabilities could be different from the estimates reected in these financial statements.

Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and under the historical cost accounting rules.
Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated financial statements which it has prepared.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes, which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Deferred tax assets in respect of timing differences are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not there will be suitable taxable profits to offset the future reversal of these timing differences.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividend income is recognised in profit or loss on the date that the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Intercompany financial guarantees When the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies in the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability, until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Share-based payments Intertek Group plc runs a share ownership programme that allows Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
Details of the share schemes are given in note 17 of the Group financial statements.
The fair value of options and share awards granted to employees of the Company is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
As the Company has no employees, there is no recognition of an employee expense nor the corresponding increase in equity.
However, the Company grants options and awards over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries and therefore the Company recognises an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries, equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in respect of employees of the subsidiaries, with the corresponding credit being recognised directly in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value granted is measured using the Monte Carlo model.
This method, in calculating the fair value, takes into account various factors including the expected volatility of the shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
The fair value of shares granted under the Intertek 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan is also measured using the Monte Carlo model and is spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
