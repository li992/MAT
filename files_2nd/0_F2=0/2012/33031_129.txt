The provision for the costs of decommissioning these wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic liveshas been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 0.5% 2011 0.5%.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 20 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 0.5% 2011 0.5%.
The weighted average period over which these costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately five years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2012 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $618 million 2011 $666 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 2.5% 2011 2.5% or a real discount rate of 0.5% 2011 0.5%, as appropriate.

Provisions continued  The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is described on pages 59-62 and in Note 2.
Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, included in the table above, are separately presented below: $ million Litigation and Clean Water Act Environmental Spill response claims penalties Total At 1 January 2012 1,517 336 9,970 3,510 15,333 New or increased provisions items not covered by the trust funds 48 62 4,773 4,883 items covered by the trust funds 753 47 1,185 1,985 Derecognition of provision for items that cannot be reliably estimated 794 794 Unwinding of discount 1 6 7 Utilization paid by BP 76 100 1,064 1,240 paid by the trust funds 381 4,243 4,624 reclassified to other payables 350 350 At 31 December 2012 1,862 345 9,483 3,510 15,200 Of which current 845 277 4,327 5,449 non-current 1,017 68 5,156 3,510 9,751 Of which payable from the trust funds 1,438 47 4,957 6,442 $ million Litigation and Clean Water Act Environmental Spill response claims penalties Total At 1 January 2011 809 1,043 10,973 3,510 16,335 New or increased provisions items not covered by the trust funds 34 586 525 1,145 items covered by the trust funds 1,133 2,905 4,038 Unwinding of discount 6 6 Change in discount rate 17 17 Utilization paid by BP 33 1,293 1,175 2,501 paid by the trust funds 449 3,258 3,707 At 31 December 2011 1,517 336 9,970 3,510 15,333 Of which current 961 282 8,194 9,437 non-current 556 54 1,776 3,510 5,896 Of which payable from the trust funds 1,066 8,809 9,875 As described in Note 2, BP has recorded provisions at 31 December 2012 relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill including amounts in relation to environmental expenditure, spill response costs, litigation and claims, and Clean Water Act penalties, each of which is described below.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP are subject to significant uncertainty as described in Note 2 and below.
Environmental The amounts committed by BP for a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico have been provided for.
BPs commitment is to provide $500 million of funding, and the remaining commitment, on a discounted basis, of $376 million was included in provisions at 31 December 2012.
This amount is expected to be spent over the remaining life of the programme.
As a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90, BP faces claims by the United States, as well as by State, tribal, and foreign trustees, if any, for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
These damages include, among other things, the reasonable costs of assessing the injury to natural resources.
BP has been incurring natural resource damage assessment costs and a provision has been made for the estimated costs of the assessment phase.
Since May 2010, more than 200 initial and amended work plans have been developed to study resources and habitat.
The study data will inform an assessment of injury to the Gulf Coast natural resources and the development of a restoration plan to mitigate the identified injuries.
Detailed analysis and interpretation continue on the data that have been collected.
The expected assessment spend is based upon past experience as well as identified projects.
During 2011, BP entered a framework agreement with natural resource trustees for the United States and five Gulf coast states, providing for up to $1 billion to be spent on early restoration projects to address natural resource injuries resulting from theoil spill, to be funded from the $20-billion trust fund.
In 2012, work began on the initial set of early restoration projects identified under this framework.
The total amount provided for natural resource damage assessment costs and early restoration projects was $1,486 million at 31 December 2012.
Until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining Natural Resource Damages claims other than the assessment and early restoration costs noted above, therefore no additional amounts have been provided for these items and they are disclosed as a contingent liability.
See Note 43 for further information.
Spill response Further amounts were provided relating to the spill response during 2012, totalling $0.1 billion 2011 $0.6 billion.
By the end of 2012, the US Coast Guards Federal On-Scene Coordinator FOSC had deemed removal actions complete on 4,029 miles of shoreline out of 4,376 miles that were in the area of response.
Approximately 108 shoreline miles were pending further monitoring or inspection and a determination that removal actions are complete.
The remaining 239 miles are in the patrolling and maintenance phase which will continue until the FOSC determines that operational removal activity is complete.
Litigation and claims BP faces various claims, principally under OPA 90 but also including under general maritime law, by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity and loss of subsistence use of natural resources Individual and Business Claims and by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims.
BP also faces other litigation related to the Incident brought under US state law 236 Financial statements BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Financial statements 36.
Provisions continued and the laws of certain non-US jurisdictions, as well as claims by private parties under US federal securities laws and other state and federal statutes.
See Legal proceedings on pages 162-171 for further information.
The litigation and claims provision includes amounts that can be estimated reliably for the future cost of settling Individual and Business Claims, and State and Local Claims under OPA 90, including certain amounts as set forth below related to the settlements with the PSC, the cost of the agreement with the US government to resolve all federal criminal claims, and claims administration costs and legal fees.
During 2012, a provision was recognizedin the amount of $525 million in respect of the cost of the agreement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC to resolve all of the US governments federal securities claims against the company the SEC settlement.
The remaining obligation for the SEC settlement at 31 December 2012 has been reclassified to other payables as discussed below.
BP announced on 3 March 2012 that a proposed settlement had been reached with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC, subject to final written agreement and court approvals, to resolve the substantial majority of legitimate economic loss and property damage claims and exposure-based medical claims Individual and Business claims stemming from the Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill.
The PSC acts on behalf of the individual and business plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation proceedings pending in New Orleans MDL 2179.
The proposed settlement was an adjusting event after the 2011 reporting period and BPs estimate at that time of the cost of the settlement of $7.8 billion was therefore reflected in the 2011 financial statements.
On 18 April 2012, BP announced that it had reached definitive and fully documented settlement agreements with the PSC consistent with the terms of that settlement.
In November 2012, the court held a fairness hearing with respect to the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement and Medical Benefits Settlement Agreement and subsequently granted final approval to the Economic and Property Damages Settlement on 21 December 2012 and to the medical benefits settlement on 11 January 2013.
Under the terms of the PSC settlement agreement, several qualified settlement funds QSFs were established during the year.
These QSFs, which are funded through the Trust, each relate to specific elements of the agreement and are available to make payments to claimants in accordance with those elements of the agreement.
The total amount allocated to the seafood industry under the PSC settlement is fixed at $2.3 billion and thus amounts contributed from the Trust to the seafood compensation fund extinguish BPs liability, so the provision and related reimbursement asset are derecognized, irrespective of whether amounts have been paid out of the fund to claimants.
Utilization of the provision in 2012 included $2,230 million contributed to the seafood compensation fund.
Additionally, a further $67 million was paid to seafood industry claimants through the transition claims process.
At 31 December 2012, $1,847 million remained in the seafood compensation fund for which the related provision and reimbursement asset had been derecognized.
As at 31 December 2011, the provision for items covered by the settlement with the PSC for Individual and Business claims was $7.8 billion.
During 2012, BP increased its estimate of the cost of claims administration by $280 million and also increased the provision by a further $400 million as described below.
Business economic loss claims received by the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program DHCSSP to date are being paid at a significantly higher average amount than previously assumed by BP in formulating the original estimate of the cost.
Further, BPs initial estimate of aggregate liability under the settlement agreements was premised on BPs interpretation of certain protocols established in the Economic and Property Damages Settlement Agreement.
As part of its monitoring of payments made by the DHCSSP, BP identified multiple claim determinations that appeared to result from an interpretation of the settlement agreement by the claims administrator that BP believes was incorrect.
This interpretation produced a higher number and value of awards than the interpretation BP assumed in making the initial estimate.
Pursuant to the mechanisms in the settlement agreement, the claims administrator sought clarification from the court on this matter and on 30 January 2013, the court initially upheld the claims administrators interpretation of the agreement.
In its unaudited fourth quarter and full year 2012 results announcement dated 5 February 2013 the preliminary announcement, BP stated that if the initial trend of higher average payments than assumed by BP in its original estimate of the cost continued, then it was likely that BPs provision for these claims would be increased significantly.
Managements initial assessment of the ruling regarding the interpretation of the settlement agreement led to an increase in the estimated cost of the settlement with the PSC of $400 million, bringing the total estimated cost to $8.5 billion.
This estimate was based upon managements initial assessment of the rulings impact on claims already submitted to and processed by the DHCSSP.
At that time, BP was seeking reversal of the courts decision in relation to this matter, and management concluded that it was not possible to estimate reliably the impact of the interpretation on any future claims not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP.
On 6 February 2013, the court reconsidered and vacated its ruling of 30 January 2013 and stayed the processing of certain types of business economic loss claims.
The court lifted the stay on 28 February 2013.
On 5 March 2013, the court affirmed the claims administrators interpretation of the agreement and rejected BPs position as it relates to business economic loss claims.
BP strongly disagrees with the ruling of 5 March 2013 and the current implementation of the agreement by the claims administrator.
BP intends to pursue all available legal options including rights of appeal, to challenge this ruling.
Other business economic loss claims continue to be paid at a higher average amount than previously assumed by BP in determining its initial estimate of the total cost.
Management has continued to analyse the claims in the period since 5 February 2013 to gain a better understanding of whether or not the number and average value of claims received and processed to date are predictive of future claims and so would allow management to estimate the total cost reliably.
Management has concluded, based upon this analysis, that it is not possible to determine whether the claims experience to date is, or is not, an appropriate basis for estimating the total cost.
Therefore, given the inherent uncertainty that exists as BP pursues all available legal options to challenge the recent ruling, and the higher number of claims received and higher average claims payments than previously assumed by BP, which may or may not continue, management has concluded that no reliable estimate can be made of any business economic loss claims not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP.
Therefore, the provision for business economic loss claims at 31 December 2012 included in these financial statements now includes only the estimated cost of claims already received and processed by the DHCSSP.
As a consequence, an amount of $0.8 billion previously provided for future claims not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP, has been derecognized, with a corresponding reduction in the reimbursement asset and therefore no net impact on the income statement, as no reliable estimate can be made for this liability.
It is therefore disclosed as a contingent liability in Note 43.
A provision will be re-established when a reliable estimate can be made of the liability as explained more fully below.
BPs current estimate of the total cost of those elements of the PSC settlement that can be estimated reliably, which excludes any future business economic loss claims not yet received or processed by the DHCSSP, is $7.7 billion.
If BP is successful in its challenge to the courts ruling, the total estimated cost of the settlement agreement will, nevertheless, be significantly higher than the current estimate of $7.7 billion because business economic loss claims not yet received or processed are not reflected in the current estimate and the average payments per claim determined so far are higher than anticipated.
If BP is not successful in its challenge to the courts ruling, a further significant increase to the total estimated cost of the settlement will be required but BP will continue to challenge the current interpretation and implementation of the settlement agreement by the claims administrator using all legal avenues available, including rights of appeal.
However, there can be no certainty as to how the dispute will ultimately be resolved or determined.
To the extent that there are insufficient funds available in the Trust fund, payments under the PSC settlement will be made by BP directly and charged to the income statement.
Financial statements 237 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 36.
Provisions continued Significant uncertainties exist in relation to the amount of claims that are to be paid and will become payable through the claims process.
There is significant uncertainty in relation to the amounts that ultimately will be paid in relation to current claims, and the number, type and amounts payablefor claims not yet reported.
In addition, there is further uncertainty in relation to interpretations of the claims administrator regarding the protocols under the settlement agreement and judicial interpretation of these protocols, and the outcomes of any further litigation including in relation to potential opt-outs from the settlement or otherwise.
The PSC settlement is uncapped except for economic loss claims related to the Gulf seafood industry.
While BP has determined its current best estimate of the cost of those aspects of the settlement with the PSC that can be measured reliably, it is possible that the actual cost of those items could be significantly higher than this estimate due to the uncertainties noted above.
In addition, the provision will be re-established for remaining business economic loss claims as more information becomes available, the interpretation of the protocols is clarified and the claims process matures, enabling BP to estimate reliably the cost of these claims.
BP will continue to analyse claims data and reevaluate the assumptions underlying the provision.
The provision recognized for litigation and claims includes an estimate for State and Local government claims.
Although the provision recognized is BPs current reliable best estimate of the amount required to settle these obligations, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the outcome of any litigation proceedings and the amount of claims that will become payable by BP.
In January 2013, the States of Alabama, Mississippi and Florida formally presented their claims to BP under OPA 90 for alleged losses including economic and property damage as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill see Note 43 for further information.
BP reached an agreement in November 2012 with the US government, subject to court approval, to resolve all criminal claims arising from the incident under which BP will pay $4 billion in instalments over a period of five years.
A provision of $3.85 billion has been recognized, representing the discounted cost of the agreement.
This settlement was approved by the court in January 2013 and is not covered by the Trust.
In addition, BP reached a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, which was approved by the court in December 2012, resolving all of the US governments securities claims against the company, under which BP has agreed to a civil penalty of $525 million, payable in three instalments over a period of three years.
On 10 December 2012, a federal judge issued a final judgment regarding the SECs claims and the terms of the settlement.
During 2012, a provision was recognized in the amount of $525 million in respect of the cost of the SEC settlement.
The remaining obligation of $350 million for the SEC settlement at 31 December 2012, which is not covered by the trust fund, has been reclassified to other payables.
BP also faces other litigation for which no reliable estimate of the cost can currently be made.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items.
Clean Water Act penalties A provision has been made for the estimated penalties for strict liability under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
Such penalties are subject to a statutory maximum calculated as the product of a per-barrel maximum penalty rate and the number of barrels of oil spilled.
Uncertainties currently exist in relation to both the penalty rate that will ultimately be imposed and the volume of oil spilled.
A charge for potential Clean Water Act Section 311 penalties was first included in BPs second-quarter 2010 interim financial statements.
At the time that charge was taken, the latest estimate from the intra-agency Flow Rate Technical Group created by the National Incident Commander in charge of the spill response was between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day.
The mid-point of that range, 47,500 barrels per day, was used for the purposes of calculating the charge.
For the purposes of calculating the amount of the oil flow that was discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil that had been or was projected to be captured in vessels on the surface was subtracted from the total estimated flow up until when the well was capped on 15 July 2010.
The result of this calculation was an estimate that approximately 3.2 million barrels of oil had been discharged into the Gulf.
This estimate of 3.2 million barrels was calculated using a total flow of 47,500 barrels per day multiplied by the 85 days from 22 April 2010 through 15 July 2010 less an estimate of the amount captured on the surface approximately 850,000 barrels.
This estimated discharge volume was then multiplied by $1,100 per barrel the maximum amount the statute allows in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct for the purposes of estimating a potential penalty.
This resulted in a provision of $3,510 million for potential penalties under Section 311.
The actual penalty a court may impose could be lower than $1,100 per barrel if it were determined that such a lower penalty was appropriate based on the factors a court is directed to consider in assessing a penalty.
In particular, in determining the amount of a civil penalty, Section 311 directs a court to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
Civil penalties above $1,100 per barrel up to a statutory maximum of $4,300 per barrel of oil discharged would only be imposed if alleged gross negligence or wilful misconduct were proven.
BP intends to argue for a penalty lower than $1,100 per barrel based on several of these factors.
However, the $1,100 per-barrel rate has been utilized for the purposes of calculating the provision after considering and weighing all possible outcomes and in light of: i the companys conclusion that it did not act with gross negligence or engage in wilful misconduct: and ii the uncertainty as to whether a court would assess a penalty below the $1,100 statutory maximum.
On 2 August 2010, the United States Department of Energy and the Flow Rate Technical Group had issued an estimate that 4.9 million barrels of oil had flowed from the Macondo well, and 4.05 million barrels had been discharged into the Gulf the difference being the amount of oil captured by vessels on the surface as part of BPs well containment efforts.
It was and remains BPs view, based on the analysis of available data by its experts, that the 2 August 2010 Government estimate is not reliable.
BP believes that the 2 August 2010 discharge estimate is overstated by at least 20%.
If the flow rate were 20% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that flowed from the Macondo well would be approximately 3.9 million barrels and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 3.1 million barrels using a current estimate of barrels captured by vessels on the surface of 810,000 in line with the stipulation entered with the US government see Legal Proceedings on pages 162-171, which is not materially different from the amount we used for our original estimate at the end of the second quarter 2010.
For the purposes of calculating a provision for fines and penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, BP has continued to use an estimate of 3.2 million barrels of oil discharged to the Gulf of Mexico and a penalty of $1,100 per barrel, as its current best estimate, as defined in paragraphs 36-40 of IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, of the amounts which may be used in calculating the penalty under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act and as a result, the provision at the end of the year was $3,510 million.
The amount and timing of the amount to be paid ultimately will depend upon what is determined by the court in the federal multi-district litigation proceedings in New Orleans MDL 2179 to be the volume of oil spilled and the penalty rate that is imposed or upon any settlement, if one were to be reached.
It is not currently practicable to estimate the timing of expending these costs and the provision has been included within non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Save in relation to the amounts described in this note, and in Note 2, no other amounts have been provided as at 31 December 2012 in relation to other potential fines and penalties because it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
