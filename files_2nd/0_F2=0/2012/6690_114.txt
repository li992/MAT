Of the 6.3m provision released to the income statement, 3.8m became payable to the DfT.

Franchise commitments comprise 53.7m dilapidation provisions on vehicles, depots and stations across our three active rail franchises.
Of the dilapidation provisions, 1.2m are classified as current.
The provisions are based on managements assessment of most probable outcomes, supported where appropriate by valuations from professional external advisers.
The dilapidations will be incurred in order to meet the hand back requirements over the remaining period of the franchise, which is within the next two to three years.
Uninsured claims represent the cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date based on an assessment of the expected settlement, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents that have not yet been reported to the Group by the insurer, subject to the overall stop loss.
Of the uninsured claims, 16.7m are classified as current and 33.8m are classified as non current based on past experience of uninsured claims paid out annually.
It is estimated that the majority of uninsured claims will be settled within the next six years.
The other provision relates to restructuring costs of 0.5m, which are classified as current, and dilapidations of 0.5m which are classified as non-current.
