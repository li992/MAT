com Financial Statements Lonmin Plc [ 146] Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the Company Accounts 33 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value and then remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Attributable costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Hedging derivatives are classified on inception as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
HDSA receivable and HDSA derivative The Company is the holder of a hybrid financial instrument in Shanduka.
This comprises a HDSA receivable recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently recorded at amortised cost, and a HDSA derivative which is held at fair value excluding day one gain.
Accounting for the financing provided by the Company for Shandukas acquisition of the non-controlling interests in the Companys principal subsidiaries is considered in notes 14 and 21g of the Group accounts.
Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Current Tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of the taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits For current employees, the Company either makes payments on behalf of employees into a defined contribution scheme which the Company has set up, or makes direct payments to employees who may then make their own arrangements.
A defined contribution scheme is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate legal entity and had no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement when they are due.
Share-based payments Equity settled schemes From the grant date the fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares.
Cash settled schemes The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share appreciation rights, which are settled in cash, is recognised as an expense, with corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised as a personnel expense in the income statement.
Basis of fair value The fair value of each option or share appreciation right is determined using either a Black-Scholes option pricing model or a Monte Carlo projection model depending on the type of the award.
Market related performance conditions are reflected in the fair value of the share.
Non-market related performance conditions are allowed for using a separate assumption about the number of awards expected to vest: the final charge made reflects the numbers actually vested on the basis that non-market conditions are met.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National Insurance Contributions on Share Option Gains UITF 25, the Company provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted.

Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the Companys own shares in the employee benefit trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in the shareholders funds.
