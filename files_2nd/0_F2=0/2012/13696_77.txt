Financial Risk Management a Capital management The capital of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings and facilities disclosed in note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated balance sheet and notes 21 and 22.
The Group manages its capital to support its strategy, and there were no changes in approach to capital management during the year.
The borrowings are managed centrally and funds are onward lent to operating subsidiaries as required.
The main borrowing facility of the Group is a 75 million multi currency revolving credit facility that provides a high degree of flexibility.
An additional 50 million is available as required subject to credit approval.
There are two financial covenants related to this facility, interest cover must be no less than 400% and the ratio of group net borrowings to EBITDA should be no greater than 250%.
These covenants are tested regularly and were not breached during the year and have not been since.
The Groups businesses provide a good level of cash generation which helps fund future growth.
The Group seeks to minimise borrowings by utilising cash generated by operations that is surplus to the immediate operating needs of the business and an objective is to maintain a minimum level of cash at bank.

A 1.0% increase in interest rates would decrease Group profit before tax by 547,000. d Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investments in overseas operations in the Netherlands, Ireland, USA, Canada and Australia that have functional currencies other than sterling.
As a result the Groups balance sheet and income statement can be affected by movement in the exchange rate between sterling and the functional currencies of overseas operations.
The most important exchange rates as far as the Group is concerned is the GB Pound to Australian Dollar rate.
The fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts held at year end was not material.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and income statement translation exposures.
A number of the Groups operations transact in currencies other than their functional currency.
This creates a foreign currency exposure that is monitored and hedged centrally.
Foreign currency sensitivity Since the Group hedges the majority its transactional foreign currency exposures, the sensitivity of the results to transactional foreign currency risk is not material.
Report and Accounts 2012 68 Accounts e Credit Risk It is Group policy, implemented locally, to assess the credit risk of new customers before entering contracts.
The Group does not enter into complex derivatives to manage credit risk.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider the Groups financial assets that are not impaired to be of good credit quality including those that are past due.
See note 14 for further detail on receivables that are past due.
The groups financial assets are not secured by collateral advanced by counterparties.
In respect of trade and other receivables, the group is not exposed to any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk for cash and cash equivalents is considered negligible, since the counterparties are reputable banks with high quality external credit ratings.
