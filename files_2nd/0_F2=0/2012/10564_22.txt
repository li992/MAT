Accounting policies, estimates and judgments Accounting policies the morgan Crucible Company plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
the Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group, and include the Groups interest in associates.
the parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
these consolidated financial statements have been drawn up to 31 december 2012. the Group changed its fiscal year during the current period.
the Group now maintains a 12-month calendar fiscal year ending on 31 december.
Previously the Group maintained a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest to the accounting Reference date of the Company, 1 January.
the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with international Financial Reporting standards as adopted by the eU adopted iFRss.
the Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Generally accepted accounting Practice: these are presented on pages 116 to 125.
Where possible the Group has set out individual accounting policies in the note to the consolidated financial statements most relevant to that accounting policy.
the accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
a Measurement convention the financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Functional and presentation currency the Group financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation intra-group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to pounds sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to pounds sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
the revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to pounds sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of iFRs are recognised directly in other Comprehensive income oCi.

Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued e Impairment the carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
if any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
an impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro-rata basis.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in oCi and there is objective evidence that the asset is permanently impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in oCi is recognised in profit or loss.
a significant or prolonged decline in an available-for-sale financial assets fair value below its cost is objective evidence of impairment.
the amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount the recoverable amount of the Groups investments in receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate ie the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
the recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
in assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment an impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost and other assets not listed below is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
an impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
if the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
an impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
f Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods in the course of ordinary activities is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, trade discounts and volume rebates.
Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
if it is probable that discounts will be granted and the amount can be measured reliably, then the discount is recognised as a reduction of revenue as the sales are recognised.
g Dividends dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared and approved.
Accounting estimates and judgments Judgments made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below.
management discussed with the audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
the following accounting estimates are subject to significant uncertainty: 74 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 75 overview Business review Governance Financial statements 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued Provisions note 22 contains information about provisions.
Provisions for closure and restructuring costs, environmental issues and settlement of litigation are judgmental by their nature.
amounts provided are the Groups best estimate of exposure based on currently available information.
Recognition of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill notes 2 and 12 contains information about intangible assets recognised on acquisition.
these primarily relate to existing contracts, order books and customer relationships, which are supported by long-term relationships with key customers.
the Group has estimated that the customer relationships have an economic life of 15-20 years.
Remeasurement of deferred contingent consideration note 2 contains information on deferred contingent consideration, arising as an element of the fair value of consideration on acquisition.
deferred contingent consideration is remeasured based upon the Groups best estimate of its future liability, calculated in accordance with the acquisition agreement.
Impairment of goodwill note 12 contains information about the assumptions relating to goodwill impairment tests, including a sensitivity analysis.
Credit risk note 20 contains information about the Groups exposure to credit risk, including a sensitivity analysis.
the Group establishes both specific and general allowances for impairment losses against receivables.
the general loss allowance is estimated based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
Foreign currency exposure note 20 contains information about the foreign currency exposure of the Group and risks in relation to foreign exchange movements, including a sensitivity analysis.
Pension assumptions the principal actuarial assumptions applied to pensions are shown in note 21, including a sensitivity analysis.
the actuarial evaluation of pension assets and liabilities is based on assumptions in respect of inflation, future salary increases, discount rates, returns on investments and mortality rates.
Relatively small changes in the assumptions underlying the actuarial valuations of pension schemes can have a significant impact on the net pension liability included in the balance sheet.
Taxation the level of current tax and deferred tax recognised is dependent on the tax rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and on subjective judgments as to the outcome of decisions to be made by the tax authorities in the various tax jurisdictions around the world in which the Group operates.
deferred tax assets are recognised based on managements assessment of the extent to which they are recoverable.
Going concern the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business review on pages 6 to 35. the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Business Review.
in addition, note 20 includes the Groups policies and processes for managing financial risk: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
the Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through local banking arrangements that are supported by the flexibility provided by the Group bank facility of 150 million unsecured five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility.
the bank facility headroom at 31 december 2012 was 150 million.
the Groups forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group is able to operate within the level of its committed facilities.
the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual Report and accounts.
74 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 75 overview Business review Governance Financial statements notes to tHe Consolidated FinanCial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies, estimates and judgments continued Adoption of new and revised Standards during the period, the Group has applied amendments to iFRs 7 Disclosures Transfers of Business Assets.
the above amendment has not had any significant impact on the reported results or financial position of the Group.
For the year ended 31 december 2013 the Group is required to adopt ias 19 revised Employee Benefits.
the Groups expectation is that profit before taxation for 2013 will be approximately 6 million lower than if the current ias 19 had been applied.
the reasons for this are: i a 1.2 million increase in operating costs as a result of the requirement to reclassify pension scheme administration costs from net finance charge to operating costs.
such costs include the PPF levy and actuary, audit, legal and trustee charges which, under the current ias 19, are allowed to be included within the net finance charge.
ii a 4.8 million increase in the net financing costs, being the net of a 6 million additional charge due to the new requirement for the expected return on assets to be calculated by applying the corporate bond yield discount rate to the balance sheet pension-related assets, offset by a 1.2 million decrease as a result of the reclassification of the administration costs to operating charges identified above.
the Group does not expect there to be a material change in the Group pension deficit as a result of the change in the accounting standard.
the Group does not expect that the adoption of any other standards and interpretations that are in issue but not yet effective to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
Acquisitions Accounting policies Step acquisitions step acquisitions arise when the Group acquires control of an entity through successive share purchases.
the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired are recorded at fair value on the date that control is acquired.
For step acquisitions occurring before 3 January 2010 the amount recognised as goodwill or negative goodwill is determined separately for each tranche acquired, calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, in accordance with iFRs 3 Business Combinations 2004. any changes in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired between the acquisition date and the date that control is obtained are recorded in other reserves in equity to the extent that they have not previously been recognised in the income statement.
any future step acquisitions would be accounted for in accordance with iFRs 3 Business Combinations 2008.
Acquisitions Clearpower Limited in 2007 the Group acquired 49% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower limited, a company that, via two intermediary holding companies, owns 100% of nP aerospace limited.
on 5 January 2009 the Group acquired the remaining 51% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower limited for a total of 56.8 million, an amount contingent on the future performance of Clearpower limited.
this comprised 12.2 million in cash for 11% of the ordinary share capital and 44.6 million in discounted deferred contingent consideration for 40% of the ordinary share capital.
the discounted deferred contingent consideration took the form of four synthetic forwards each to acquire 10% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower limited at future dates from 2010 onwards, the amount of which are based on a fixed eBitda multiple of Clearpower limited.
on 1 april 2010 the Group agreed to pay 24.9 million.
of this amount 17.2 million related to the first of the four synthetic forwards.
the remaining payment of 7.7 million related to deferred contingent consideration on the acquisition of 11% of Clearpower limited in 2009.
12.4 million of the total was deferred for payment until 6 July 2010. in addition to these payments the Group paid 2.3 million to the employee Benefit trust in accordance with the terms of the original acquisition agreement.
on 31 march 2011 and 28 march 2012 the Group paid 9.1 million and 6.1 million respectively for the second and third synthetic forwards.
in addition to these payments on 31 march 2011 and 28 march 2012 the Group paid 0.8 million and 0.6 million respectively to the employee Benefit trust in accordance with the terms of the original acquisition agreement.
the Group carries a liability of 0.3 million, representing the best estimate of the amount it will pay to acquire the remaining 10% of the ordinary share capital of Clearpower limited.
this is included within current non-trade payables.
the unwinding of the discount on this liability of 0.2 million is recorded as a finance expense see note 7. the adjustment through goodwill since the date of acquisition as a result of the remeasurement is 9.3 million.
Other acquisitions in 2012 and 2011 there were no other business combinations in 2012 and 2011.

Taxation income tax expense Accounting policies income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in oCi, in which case it is recognised in oCi.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
the following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
a deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.

Property, plant and equipment Accounting policies i Owned assets items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses.
the cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of the asset.
Gains and losses on the disposal of property are recognised in other one-off items in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of plant and equipment are recognised in operating costs in the income statement.
ii Leased assets leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
iii Depreciation depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date.
the estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment and fixtures 3-20 years 82 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 83 overview Business review Governance Financial statements notes to tHe Consolidated FinanCial statements continued 11.

Intangible assets Accounting policies i Goodwill all business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment.
ii Research and development expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, use and sale of products or processes.
the expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Other intangible assets other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses.
iv Amortisation amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
the estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 3 years Computer software 3-6 years Customer relationships 15-20 years technology and trademarks 15-20 years order book amortised over the period in which the associated orders are fulfilled 84 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 85 overview Business review Governance Financial statements notes to tHe Consolidated FinanCial statements continued 12.

Goodwill is attributed to each cash-generating unit as follows: 2012 2011 m m technical Ceramics 67.2 69.4 thermal Ceramics 20.4 21.0 morgan am&t 101.7 107.5 molten metal systems 1.8 1.9 191.1 199.8 86 The Morgan Crucible Company plc Annual Report 2012 Annual Report 2012 The Morgan Crucible Company plc 87 overview Business review Governance Financial statements 12.
Intangible assets continued each cash-generating unit is assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
as part of the annual impairment test review the carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to its value in use reflecting the projected discounted cash flows of each cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated.
the key assumptions used in determining value in use relate to growth rates and discount rates.
the cash flow projections in year one are based on budgeted operating results for the forthcoming year.
Growth rates for the period not covered by budgets are specific to each operating segment, ranging from 2.0% to 5.0% 2011: 2.0% to 5.0%.
these growth rates reflect the products, industries and countries in which the operating segments operate.
these mediumto long-term growth rates have been reviewed by management during 2012 and are considered to be appropriate.
Given the similar risk profiles of each of the operating segments, together with common funding from the central Group treasury function, a standard pre-tax discount rate of 13.3% 2011: 13.9%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows and calculating the terminal value at the end of year five.
this discount rate has been used as the Group believes it suitably approximates the rate used by end-market participants.
the directors have considered the following individual sensitivities and are confident that no impairment would arise in any of the following three circumstances: if the pre-tax discount rate was increased by 210bps to 15.4% 2011: 550bps to 19.4% : if no growth was assumed for years two to five and in the calculation of terminal value: and if the cash flow projections of all businesses were reduced by 15% 2011: 35%.
Investments Accounting policies Investments in debt and equity securities investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in oCi in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
2012 2011 m m Non-current investments investment in associate 1.5 1.5 equity securities available-for-sale 3.9 4.6 5.4 6.1 Equity securities available-for-sale the equity securities available-for-sale represent an investment in a mutual fund.
a 10% increase in the unit price would increase the fair value of the investments by 0.2 million.

Financial risk management this note presents information about the Groups exposure to a variety of financial risks: credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting policies Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity ie forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
to the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called-up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.

Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
the carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
the maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2012 2011 m m available-for-sale financial assets 3.9 4.6 trade and other receivables 165.5 169.8 Cash and cash equivalents 80.0 83.4 249.4 257.8 Available-for-sale financial assets the Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Trade and other receivables the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
the demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less influence on credit risk.
management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
the Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
the Group serves thousands of customers.
many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supplies.
the Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts, and, although the top 20 ranking will alter from year to year, many of the names remain consistent over time.
the Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
the main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a general loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
the general loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
the ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross impairment 2012 2012 2011 2011 m m m m not past due 125.5 0.5 136.3 1.6 Past due 0-30 days 21.6 0.4 21.9 0.5 Past due 31-60 days 8.9 0.5 5.4 0.2 Past due 61-90 days 13.6 3.9 6.3 0.4 Past due more than 90 days 8.5 7.3 9.3 6.7 178.1 12.6 179.2 9.4 the only movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables was an increase of 3.3 million 2011: 0.2 million.
a specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
as at 31 december 2012 and 1 January 2012 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
the allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash balances held by companies representing 80% of the Groups revenue are managed centrally through a number of pooling arrangements.
Cash balances throughout the Group are held with high-credit-quality financial institutions.

Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by cash.
the Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions.
the Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
the policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

the objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
the Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business for hedging purposes, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
all such transactions are carried out in accordance with the treasury Policy, which has been approved by the audit Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk at the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Fixed rate instruments carrying amounts 2012 2011 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets 11.6 Financial liabilities 271.1 292.7 271.1 281.1 Variable rate instruments carrying amounts 2012 2011 m m Variable rate instruments Financial assets 80.0 83.4 Financial liabilities 2.7 19.1 77.3 64.3 interest rate risk is regularly monitored and reviewed taking into account the Groups overall borrowing costs, interest cover ratio and the relevant interest rate markets.
the fixed rate financial liabilities comprise the currency equivalent of 270.1 million 2011: 287.6 million of Us Private Placement debt.
the average cost of the Groups fixed rate debt is 5.7% 2011: 5.7%.
an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates on the variable element of the Groups net debt at the reporting date would have increased profit by 0.8 million 2011: 0.7 million.
a decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased profit by 0.4 million 2011: 0.5 million.
this analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
Foreign currency risk the table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved, other than certain non-GBP borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas entities.

the Group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
at any point in time the Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
the Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
in respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
the Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
the fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 31 december 2012 was an asset of 1.0 million 2011: asset of 0.3 million.
the contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
the impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
the Group maintains in-country local currency borrowings, and has designated certain forward foreign exchange contracts and other borrowings as hedges of the foreign exchange risk associated with investments in foreign operations.
in this way, the Group seeks to manage the translation exposure of overseas net assets, but only to the extent that its gearing covenant under the terms of its loan documents, as well as its facility headroom, are likely to remain comfortably within limits, and provided the associated costs are not prohibitive.
the Groups currency split of total borrowings after the impact of net investment hedges was as follows: 2012 2011 m m GBP 4.6 8.9 Usd 205.6 221.0 49.8 70.6 Japanese Yen 10.0 11.8 other 2.8 0.6 272.8 295.1 the Groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on financial assets and liabilities as at 31 december 2012 is as follows: at 31 december 2012, if GBP had weakened strengthened by 10% against Usd with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.3 million 2011: 1.3 million higher lower.
equity would have been 18.8 million 2011: 25.1 million higher lower.
at 31 december 2012, if GBP had weakened strengthened by 10% against with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million 2011: 0.3 million higher lower.
equity would have been 8.5 million 2011: 4.7 million higher lower.
the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected results due to developments.
the impact of a weakening in GBP on the Groups financial assets and liabilities would be more than offset in equity and income by its impact on the Groups overseas net assets and earnings respectively.
the impact of a one-cent movement in the Usd exchange rate on results that are reported in Usd would be a movement of circa 2.1 million in revenue and 0.2 million in profit.

Financial risk management continued Other market price risk equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
the primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
the Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KPi, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
the main KPi for the Group is the underlying operating profit margin.
the aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double-digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
the Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys ordinary shares.
the Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
the Company may also acquire its own shares under a share buy-back programme.
the Board seeks to maintain a balance between the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position, and the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings.
the Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Debt to adjusted capital 2012 2011 m m total interest-bearing loans and borrowings 272.8 295.1 less: cash and cash equivalents and overdrafts 80.0 79.7 net debt 192.8 215.4 total equity 271.8 270.2 less: amounts accumulated in equity relating to cash flow hedges 0.7 0.4 adjusted capital 271.1 269.8 debt to adjusted capital ratio 0.7 0.8 Net debt to EBITDA 2012 2011 m m net debt to eBitda 192.8 215.4 operating profit before restructuring and other one-off items 113.7 135.1 depreciation and amortisation 38.3 39.4 eBitda 152.0 174.5 net debt to eBitda ratio 1.3x 1.2x Interest cover 2012 2011 m m eBitda 152.0 174.5 net finance costs excluding ias 19 pension and discount on deferred consideration 16.9 20.4 interest cover 9.0x 8.6x net debt is defined as interest-bearing loans and borrowings, bank overdrafts less cash and cash equivalents.

Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market either using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
the interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings are 2.0-5.2% 2011: 2.4-5.2% and finance leases 6.0% 2011: 6.0%.
Finance lease liabilities the fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
the estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
all other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.

Financial risk management continued Fair value hierarchy the table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.
the different levels have been defined as follows: level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Employee benefits Accounting policies i Defined contribution plans obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans the Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
the discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on aa-credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
the calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
an economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in oCi in the year in which they arise.
iii Long-term service benefits the Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
the obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions the grant date fair value of share-based payment awards granted to employees is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
the amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.

if the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
