co. uk 114 Pennon Group Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial statements Share fraud warning Share fraud includes scams where investors are called out of the blue and offered shares that often turn out to be worthless or nonexistent, or are offered an inated price for shares that they own.
These calls come from fraudsters operating in boiler rooms that are mostly based abroad: often they imply a connection to the company concerned and they can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
Whilst high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money.
The Financial Services Authority FSA has found most share fraud victims are experienced investors who lose an average of 20,000, with around 200 million lost in the UK each year.
Protect yourself If you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, a premium price for shares you own, or free company or research reports, you should take these steps before handing over any money: 1.
