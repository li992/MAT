25 retirement benefit obligations surplus During the year the Company operated two pension schemes, the A. G. BARR p. l. c. 2005 Defined Contribution Scheme and the A. G. BARRp.
l. c. 2008 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme.
The latter is a funded defined benefit scheme based on final salary which also includes a defined contribution section for the pension provision of new executive entrants.
Under the defined benefit scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable pay.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
Defined benefit scheme: actuarial valuation The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested in managed funds.
A full valuation of the scheme was conducted as at 5 April 2011 using the attained age method.
The total assets of the defined benefit scheme at valuation were 81,825,000.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate post-retirement, rate of inflation, real salary growth above inflation and life expectancy.
For the purposes of the 5 April 2011 valuation, the discount and inflation rates were assumed to be 4.9% and 3.45% respectively.
Salary increases were assumed to be 4.7% and the expected age at death for males was 88 to 89 and for females was 90 to 92 depending on their age at 5 April 2011.
The surplus as at 5 April 2011 determined using the above assumptions was 2,300,000.
Defined benefit scheme: IAS 19 information The full actuarial valuation carried out at 5 April 2011 was updated to 28 January 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The valuation used for the defined benefit scheme has been based on market conditions as at the Company year end.
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position are as follows: 2012 2011 Group and Company 000 000 Present value of funded obligations 83,341 77,414 Fair value of scheme assets 82,954 79,506 Deficit surplus recognised in the statement of financial position 387 2,092 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Interest on obligation 4,357 4,202 Expected return on scheme assets 5,234 4,446 Net finance income relating to defined benefit schemes note 6 877 244 Curtailment gain 497 341 Past service credit 2,582 Current service cost 1,181 1,305 Total income cost recognised in the income statement 2,775 720 The current service charge has been included within Administration costs in the income statement.

The Groups defined benefit obligation reduced by 497,000 2011: 341,000, with a corresponding 497,000 2011: 341,000 credit being recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional items.
As disclosed in note 5, a pension increase exercise was undertaken during the year.
This resulted in a past service cost credit of 2,582,000 being recognised.
This has been treated as an exceptional item in the year to 28 January 2012.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 5.08% assumption as at 28 January 2012 and is the expected long term rate of return for the year ending 26 January 2013.
Mortality assumptions The mortality tables adopted in finalising the fair value of the liabilities is PA92 Year of birth mc 2 years.
This assumes that the expected age at death for males is 87 to 88 and for females is 89 to 91 depending on their age at 28 January 2012.
