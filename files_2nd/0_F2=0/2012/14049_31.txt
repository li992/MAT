Section 3 | Our performance Finance Review 3.
Cash ow The Group generated a free cash inow of 181.2m 2011: 168.3m, with the increase arising principally from the increase in profits and the exceptionally high level of dividends received from joint ventures.
For 2013, it is anticipated that there will be further incremental working capital investment to support growth in our BPO business and lower dividends from joint ventures, which may result in free cash ow being lower than the level achieved in 2012.
Figure 3 provides cash ow analysis.
As in previous years, we have designed the analysis to show the underlying cash performance of the Group the cash ows generated by subsidiaries plus the dividends received from joint ventures.
It therefore differs from the consolidated cash ow on page 119, which proportionately consolidates the cash ows of joint ventures.
The adjustment line in Figure 3 reconciles the movement in Group cash to the consolidated cash ow.

Financing is stated net of directly reimbursed capital expenditure.
3.1 Operating cash ow excluding joint ventures Operating cash ow excluding joint ventures of 245.8m 2011: 240.4m reects a conversion of Adjusted EBITDA into cash of 83.8% 2011: 88.2%.
The increase in working capital movement to 47.6m 2011: 32.3m principally reects the timing of transition and mobilisation of new contract awards and an increased level of investment in supporting growth of our BPO business.
3.2 Interest Net interest paid increased to 44.7m 2011: 32.7m, principally reecting higher average Group recourse net debt following acquisitions during the current and prior year.
The increase in cash tax is principally as a result of higher overseas taxable profits arising in the year.
Cash tax remains below the equivalent charge in the income statement principally as a result of the availability of accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences.
