Mine Life The extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
The tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes and abbreviated as Mt for million tonnes.
The Mineral Resources are constrained by a resource pit shell, which fide fines the spatial limits of eventual economic extraction.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
The Phoenix Project is not reported in 2012: the previously declared Mineral Resource are being re-evaluated to consider different bene ciation options and will have to be re-submitted for project approval.
1 Kolomela Ore Reserves: Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 42.0 %Fe including dilution.
The effect of production is offset by the increase resulting from a life-of-mine plan update, which included a pit optimisation with updated economic assumptions.
2 Sishen Ore Reserves: Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 40.0 %Fe including dilution.
The decrease is primarily due to production and a lower conversion rate of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves.
3 Thabazimbi Ore Reserves: Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 54.6 %Fe including dilution.
The decrease is primarily due to production and some Ore Reserves being re-allocated to Inferred Mineral Resources.
4 Kolomela Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 50.0 %Fe.
The increase is due to changes in the resource shell as a result of pit a optimisation conducted based on updated economic assumptions.
5 Sishen Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 40.0 %Fe.
The overall decrease is a result of a geological model update, revised estimation methods combined with new borehole information which resulted in a decrease of primarily BIF material.
Stockpile Resource estimates Measured: 52.2 Mt at 58.1 %Fe: Indicated: 11.9 Mt at 57.7 %Fe: Inferred: 3.2 Mt at 56.7 %Fe are excluded from the table.
6 Thabazimbi Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 55.0 %Fe.
The increase is due to changes in the resource shell as a result of updated economic assumptions.
7 Zandrivierspoort: The Zandrivierspoort Project Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 23.0 %Fe.
A minor update to the resource classi cation was undertaken in 2012.
Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2012 at Kolomela Mine.
Assumption with respect to Mineral Tenure Sishen: In December 2011 judgment was delivered by the High Court regarding the status of the mining rights at the Sishen mine.
The High Court held that, upon the conversion of SIOCs old order Mining Right relating to the Sishen mine properties in 2008, SIOC became the exclusive holder of a converted mining right for iron ore and quartzite in respect of the Sishen mine properties.
The High Court held further that as a consequence, any decision taken by the Department: Mineral Resources DMR after such conversion in 2008 to accept or grant any further rights to iron ore at the Sishen mine properties was void.
Finally, the High Court reviewed and set aside the decision of the DMR to grant a prospecting right to ICT relating to iron ore as to a 21.4% share in respect of the Sishen mine properties.
Both the DMR and Imperial Crown Trading have lodged an appeal against the ruling by the High Court, which appeal is enrolled for hearing by the Supreme Court of Appeal on 19 February 2013.
196 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES IRON ORE estimates as at 31 December 2012 IRON ORE BRAZIL The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The Minas-Rio project is located in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil and will include open pit mines and a bene ciation plant producing high-grade pellet feed which will be transported, through a slurry pipeline, over 500km to the Port of Au in the state of Rio fide Janeiro.
The project will largely be based on the two main deposits of Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga.
Two ore types, Friable and Compact Itabirite, have been identi ed at Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga.
Only the friable material is being considered for Phase 1 of the project.
The planned annual capacity of Phase 1 is 26.5 Mtpa of iron ore pellet feed wet tonnes.
