Acquisitions in 2011 were originally stated at provisional values.
These fair values have now been finalised and no adjustments have been made to the prior year balance sheet on grounds of immateriality in accordance with IAS 8.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the groups of cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: As at As at 31 Dec 31 Dec 000s 2012 2011 Built and Natural Environment UK and Ireland 140,870 142,910 Netherlands 9,574 9,723 Europe 150,444 152,633 Australia Asia Pacific 64,220 54,060 214,664 206,693 Energy 66,483 66,866 281,147 273,559 The Group tests annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Management have not identified any impairment triggering events in the period since the last annual review.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash flow projections for a CGU.
The cash flow projections in the four financial years following the budget year reflect managements expectations of the medium-term operating performance of the CGU and the growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Thereafter, a perpetuity is applied to the final years cash flows.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the discount rates applied, the growth rates and margins assumed over the forecast period.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reflects the market assessment of the time value of money at the end of the reporting period and the risks specific to the CGU.
The Group bases its estimate for the long term pre-tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The inputs to this calculation are derived from long term market and industry data.
The discount rates applied to the CGUs are in the range 10.8% to 12.0% 2011: 11.0% to 13.0%.
Growth rates The growth rates applied reflect managements expectations regarding the future performance of the business.
These incorporate the effects of the global recession over the last three years, the expected recovery of the CGUs affected and the past experience of the Group as it emerged from previous recessions.
The long term growth rate applied to the perpetuity calculations was 2.1% per annum 2011: 2.25% to 2.4% reflecting the average long term growth rates of the economies in which the CGUs are based.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment with no impairment charge resulting 2011: nil.
In the Directors view, the results are most sensitive to the discount rate used and a 1% absolute movement in the value of the discount rate is reasonably possible.
If that movement occurred the Group would not recognise any impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill in any CGU.
