Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES General Information The Berkeley Group Holdings plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The address of its registered ofce is Berkeley House, 19 Portsmouth Road, Cobham, Surrey, KT11 1JG.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group are engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development.
Further information about the nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors Report on page 86.
Basis of preparation These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and on the going concern basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed on page 122.
There were no new standards, amendments or interpretations that were adopted by the Group and effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2011 that were material to the Group.
Furthermore, there are no standards, amendments or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The Consolidated Financial Statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
Subsidiary undertakings are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain the benets from its activities.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of the acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
b Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identied separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and those interests share of changes in the equity since the date of the combination.
c Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Groups holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated statement of financial position is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
On transfer of land and or work in progress to joint ventures, the Group recognises only its share of any profits or losses, namely that proportion sold outside the Group.
Segmental reporting Operating segments are identied in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The Group determines its reportable segments having regard to permitted aggregation criteria with the principal condition being that the operating segments should have similar economic characteristics.
The Group is predominantly engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development, comprising residential revenue, revenue from land sales and commercial revenue.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 119 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED For the purposes of determining its operating segments, the chief operating decision-maker has been identied as the Executive Committee of the Board.
This committee approves investment decisions, allocates the Groups resources and reviews the internal reporting in order to assess performance.
The Group has determined that its operating segments are the management teams that report into the Executive Committee of the Board.
These management teams are all engaged in residential-led, mixed-use development in the United Kingdom and, having regard to the aggregation criteria in IFRS 8, the Group has one reportable operating segment.
In addition to its development activities, the Group holds certain residential properties for investment purposes.
These investment activities represent a separate segment which is included within Other activities, as it does not meet the size thresholds to be disclosed as a separate reportable segment.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year and other income directly associated with property development.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are recognised when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
Rental income is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Any lease incentives are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income.
Expenditure Expenditure recorded in inventory is expensed through cost of sales at the time of the related property sale.
Net operating expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxation assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Intangible assets Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews and impairment reviews performed where an impairment indicator exists, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at historic purchase cost less depreciation.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% Fixtures and ttings 15% 20% Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 1 3 % 120 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Freehold property disclosed in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements consists of both freehold land and freehold buildings.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Computer equipment is included within xtures and ttings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identied, the recoverable amount of the asset is identied and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within net operating expenses in the income statement.
Investment properties Investment properties, which are properties held to earn rental income, are recognised using the cost model and are carried in the statement of financial position at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the element of the cost of the assets that relates to buildings at 2% per annum on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is charged on the element of the cost of the assets that relates to land.
Inventories Property in the course of development and completed units are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement within net operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against net operating expense in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Share capital Ordinary shares and redeemable preference shares are classied as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, sold or reissued.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value which is considered to be their fair value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 121 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Deposits New property deposits and on account contract receipts are held within current trade and other payables.
Employee benets a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions under IAS 19 Employee benets.
The Group has both dened benefit and dened contribution plans.
The dened benefit plan was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
For the dened benefit scheme, the obligations are measured using the projected unit method.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualied actuary.
The operating and nancing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are set annually on the basis of actuarial valuations of the scheme and nancing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
In accordance with IAS 19 the Group does not recognise on the statement of financial position any surplus in the scheme.
Pension contributions under dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
b Share-based payments Where the Company operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Leasing agreements Payments under operating lease agreements are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management applies the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgements, of which no individual judgement is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Pensions Pension assumptions are set out within note 5 and are as advised by the Groups actuary.
The assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate used and the mortality rates.
Such estimations are based on assumed rates and, should these differ from what actually transpires, the pension asset of the Group would change.
c Goodwill impairment In determining whether or not goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit, the future growth rate of revenue and costs, and a suitable discount rate.
d Deferred tax Assumptions are made as to the recoverability of deferred tax assets, especially as to whether there will be sufficient future profits to fully utilise these in future years.
e Share-based payments Assumptions are made in determining the fair value of employee services received in exchange for the grant of options under share-based payment awards at the date of grant.
122 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2 SEGMENTAL DISCLOSURE The Group is engaged in residential-led, mixed-use property development, comprising residential revenue, revenue from land sales and commercial revenue.
For the purposes of determining its operating segments, the chief operating decision-maker has been identied as the Executive Committee of the Board.

Details of Directors emoluments are set out in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 89 to 105.
Share-based payments The Group operates three equity-settled share based payments schemes.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year relating to grants of share options awarded under the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan and deferred shares or notional shares under the Bonus Plan, was 8,212,000 2011: 4,146,000.
The charge to the income statement attributable to key management is 7,121,000 2011: 3,099,000.
124 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan Part A On 29 June 2009 the balance of the shares originally awarded under the 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan, totalling 5,330,340 shares, were replaced by options under Part A of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Scheme, with an exercise price of 3.00 per share, in accordance with the shareholder approval obtained at the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 April 2009.
These will become exercisable by the relevant Executive Directors on 31 January 2014, subject to continued employment at that date.
During the year, 880,390 options lapsed on the departure of a Director, leaving 4,441,950 outstanding.
Part B Part B of the 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan covers 6,830,000 share options with an exercise price of 8.40.
Vesting of the options is in two tranches: 50% on 15 April 2015 and 50% on 15 April 2016.
The options are conditional on continued employment at the relevant vesting date and the satisfaction of the underpin condition that Net Assets per Share are at least 5.94 at 15 April 2015.
During the year, 530,000 options lapsed on the departure of employees, leaving 6,300,000 options outstanding.
Bonus Plan Under the terms of the Bonus Plan set out in the Remuneration Report participants to the plan are entitled to 50% of the balance of their plan account at the end of each financial year.
The remaining balance is deferred in shares or notional shares.
2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan The Company announced in June 2011 as part of a strategic review of the business a long term plan to return 13 per share approximately 1.7 billion to shareholders over the next 10 years payable on or before the following milestones: Dividend 30 September 2015 p 434 30 September 2018 p 433 30 September 2021 p 433 A new long term remuneration plan was proposed to support this strategy, the 2011 Long Term Incentive Plan 2011 LTIP, which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 5 September 2011.
The key features of the 2011 LTIP are: if the Company returns 13 per share to shareholders over a ten year period via a series of dividend payments by the milestone dates referred to above, participants will be entitled to exercise options and receive a number of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company at the end of the ten year period.
the maximum number of shares capable of being earned by all participants are 19,616,503 shares, being 13% of the fully diluted share capital of the company at the date of approval of the plan.
the exercise price of options granted under the 2011 LTIP will be 13 per share less an amount equal to the value of all dividends paid between the date of approval of the 2011 LTIP and 30 September 2021, provided the exercise price cannot be less than zero.
The fair value of the options granted during the year, determined using the current market pricing model was 3.17 for options which vest on 30 September 2021.
The inputs into the current market option pricing model were: Inputs Grant date 5 September 2011 Vesting date 30 September 2021 Share price at grant gate p 1,236 Exercise price p nil Discount rate 6.3% The discount rate was determined by calculating the Groups expected cost of capital over the vesting period at the grant date.
Pensions During the year, two principal pension schemes were in place for employees.
The Berkeley Group plc Group Personal Pension Plan and the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan are dened contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a dened benefit scheme which was closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2007.
Dened contribution plan Contributions amounting to 2,415,000 2011: 2,155,000 were paid into the dened contribution schemes during the year.
Berkeley Annual Report 2012 125 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES CONTINUED Dened benefit plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recently nalised valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2010 and was nalised in March 2011.
The method adopted in the 2010 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment both prior to and after retirement of 5.75% per annum and pension increases of 3.25% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2010 was 11,692,000 and was sufficient to cover 100% of the schemes liabilities.
Following the nalisation of the 2007 valuation, with effect from 1 July 2008, employers required regular contributions were reduced to zero.
Following the nalisation of the 2011 valuation this position remains unchanged.
Notwithstanding this the Company made additional voluntary contributions of 575,000 during the year 2011: 600,000.
For the purposes of IAS 19, the 2010 valuation was updated for 30 April 2012.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30 April 30 April Valuation at: 2012 2011 Rate of increase in salaries Discount rate 4.80% 5.40% Ination assumption RPI 3.25% 3.40% Ination assumption CPI 2.50% N A Rate of increase in pensions in payment post-97 Pre-97 receive 3% p. a. increases 3.25% 3.40% The mortality assumptions are the standard S1PA CMI 2009 X [1.0%] 2011: S1PA CMI 2009 X [1.0%] base table for males and females, both adjusted for each individuals year of birth to allow for future improvements in mortality rates.
The life expectancy of male and female pensioners now aged 65 retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date is 22.1 years and 24.1 years respectively 2011: 22.0 and 24.0.

128 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 7 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated as profit for the financial year attributable to shareholders of the Group divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
2012 2011 profit attributable to shareholders 000s 158,513 95,109 Weighted average number of shares 000s 131,042 131,962 Basic earnings per ordinary share p 121.0 72.1 For diluted earnings per ordinary share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
At 30 April 2012, the Group had four categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: 4.4 million 3.00 share options under the 2009 LTIP Part A, 6.3 million 8.40 share options under the 2009 LTIP Part B: 19.6 million nil share options under the 2011 LTIP: and 0.5 million shares under the Bonus Plan.
A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the aggregate of the exercise price of each share option and the fair value of future services to be supplied to the Group which is the unamortised share-based payments charge.
The difference between the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value and the total number of options is used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.

Berkeleys share of the proceeds of the sale of the company was 75.7 million and this resulted in an exceptional profit on disposal of 30.7 million, calculated as follows: 2012 000 Non current assets 1,172 Current assets 47,052 Current liabilities 4 Non controlling interest 4,063 Net assets disposed 44,157 Expenses related to disposal 816 profit on disposal 30,695 Consideration 75,668 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 129 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 9 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill 000 Cost At 1 May 2011 and 30 April 2012 17,159 Accumulated amortisation At 1 May 2011 and at 30 April 2012 Net book value At 1 May 2011 and at 30 April 2012 17,159 Cost At 1 May 2010 and 30 April 2011 17,159 Accumulated amortisation At 1 May 2010 and at 30 April 2011 Net book value At 1 May 2010 and at 30 April 2011 17,159 The goodwill balance relates solely to the acquisition of the 50% of the ordinary share capital of St James Group Limited, completed on 7 November 2006, that was not already owned by the Group.
The goodwill balance is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount has been determined on the basis of the value in use of the business using the current five year pre-tax forecasts.
Key assumptions are as follows: i Cash ows beyond a five year period are not extrapolated: ii A pre-tax discount rate of 8.28% 2011: 8.71% based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The Directors have identied no reasonably possible change in a key assumption which would give rise to an impairment charge.
The market value of these properties is 114,500,000 as determined by the Directors taking into account all relevant factors including their nature and location.
49,700,000 of the investment properties, at cost 2011: 13,700,000, are subject to an agreement with the Homes and Communities Agency which requires these properties to be available for rent until at least 31 March 2015, although Berkeley is able to dispose of its investment properties prior to this date.

The Groups objective when managing capital is to maintain an appropriate capital structure in the business to allow management to focus on creating sustainable long-term value for its shareholders, with exibility to take advantage of opportunities as they arise in the short and medium term.
This allows the Group to take advantage of prevailing market conditions by investing in land and work in progress at the right point in the cycle or delivering returns to shareholders through dividends or share buy backs.
Last year the Group put in place a long-term strategic plan to see 13 per share returned to shareholders over the next 10 years.
This plan ensures there is sufficient working capital retained in the business to continue investing selectively in new land opportunities as they arise.
The Group monitors capital levels principally by monitoring net cash debt levels, cash ow forecasts and return on average capital employed.
The Group considers capital employed to be net assets adjusted for net cash debt.
The increase in capital employed in the year of 265,992,000 reects significant investment in land and work in progress during the year.
The Groups financial instruments comprise financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents and financial liabilities being: loan stock, bank loans, trade payables, deposits and on account receipts, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowing are the principal financial instruments used to finance the business.
The other financial instruments highlighted arise in the ordinary course of business.
As all of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling there is no direct currency risk, and therefore the Groups main financial risks are primarily: liquidity risk the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available: market interest rate risk the risk that Group nancing activities are adversely affected by uctuation in market interest rates: and credit risk the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a loss to the Group.
Financial instruments: Financial assets The Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Current Trade receivables 105,250 79,422 Cash and cash equivalents 2,747 266,307 107,997 345,729 Trade receivables are non-interest bearing.
Cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits held at either oating rates linked to LIBOR or xed rates.

Current bank loans have term expiry dates within twelve months of the balance sheet date and are held at oating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Trade payables and other current liabilities are non-interest bearing.
Non-current bank loans have term expiry dates after twelve months from the balance sheet date and are held at oating interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Non current other loans represent a loan from the Homes and Communities Agency on which interest is payable based on a proportionate share of the net rental income arising from the properties to which the loan relates.
The maturity prole of the Groups non-current financial liabilities, all of which are held at amortised cost, is as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 In more than one year but not more than two years 20,709 31,929 In more than two years but not more than five years 22,180 16,336 In more than five years 26,977 42,889 75,242 The carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities approximate to fair value.
Current trade receivables and current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms and have a short period to maturity less than one year.
The loan stock is repayable at book value on three months notice being given to the Company.
Non-current trade payables comprise long-term land creditors, which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The discount rate applied reects the nominal, risk-free pre-tax rate at the balance sheet date, applied to the maturity prole of the individual land creditors within the total.
Non-current loans approximate to fair value as they are held at variable market interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Liquidity risk This is the risk that suitable funding for the Groups activities may not be available.
Group management addresses this risk through review of rolling cash ow forecasts throughout the year to assess and monitor the current and forecast availability of funding, and to ensure sufficient headroom against facility limits and compliance with banking covenants.
The committed borrowing facilities are set out below.
138 Berkeley Annual Report 2012 Financials Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The contractual undiscounted maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities, included at their carrying value in the preceding tables, is as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 In less than one year 897,504 978,283 In more than one year but not more than two years 20,983 32,600 In more than two years but not more than five years 22,498 16,633 In more than five years 27,720 940,985 1,055,236 Market interest rate risk The Groups cash and cash equivalents and bank loans expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
The Groups rolling cash ow forecasts incorporate appropriate interest assumptions, and management carefully assesses expected activity levels and associated funding requirements in the prevailing and forecast interest rate environment to ensure that this risk is managed.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments, when commercially appropriate, to manage interest rate risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2011: nil.
If interest rates on the Groups cash debt balances had been 50 basis points higher throughout the year ended 30 April 2012, profit after tax for the year would have been 14,000 lower 2011: 124,000 lower.
This calculation is based on the monthly closing net cash debt balance throughout the year excluding xed rate deposits where the deposits were in place prior to 1 May 2011.
A 50 basis point increase in interest rate represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change for the year ended 30 April 2012.
The Groups loan stock amounts to 9,000 2011: 29,000 and so no sensitivity analysis has been prepared against this interest bearing financial liability as any impact would not be material.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk encompasses the financial assets being: trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Trade receivables are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
There has been no impairment of trade receivables during the year 2011: nil, nor are there any provisions held against trade receivables 2011: nil, and no trade receivables are past their due date 2011: nil.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited because counterparties are leading international banks with long-term A credit-ratings assigned by international credit agencies.
Committed borrowing facilities The Group has committed borrowing facilities as follows: 2012 2011 Available Drawn Undrawn Termination Available Drawn Undrawn Termination 000 000 000 date 000 000 000 date Revolving credit facility 1 200,000 10,000 190,000 Nov-13 200,000 100,000 100,000 Nov-13 Revolving credit facility 2 250,000 25,000 225,000 Apr-16 250,000 100,000 150,000 Apr-16 Site specic facility 68,000 17,504 50,496 Sep-20 450,000 35,000 415,000 518,000 217,504 300,496 The drawn facilities of 35,000,000 do not include unamortised issue costs which are netted off the drawn funds for the purpose of disclosing borrowings as set out in note 15.
At 30 April 2012 the total drawn down balance across both facilities was 35 million.
The Group completed the renancing of its main banking facilities on 24 May 2012, increasing available facilities from 450 million to 525 million, with maturity dates extended to April 2017 in the case of revolving credit facility one and May 2017 in the case of revolving credit facility two, a level that is commensurate with the capital structure and requirements of the Group.
The revolving credit facilities are secured by debentures provided by certain Group holding companies over their assets.
The facility agreement contains financial covenants, which is normal for such agreements, all of which the Group is in compliance with.
In the year to 30 April 2012, the Group terminated the site specic facility that it had in place for the development of a student scheme at Clapham Junction with Imperial College, as part of the disposal of the Groups 51% shareholding in Winstanley 1 Limited as referred to in Note 8.
