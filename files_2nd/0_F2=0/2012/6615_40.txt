indd 1 02 03 2013 00:41 GSK Annual Summary 2012 Chief Executives letter to shareholders Five years ago we set out a strategy to increase growth, reduce risk and improve our long-term financial performance.
We have made good progress and 2012 provided further evidence of this.
Despite operating in a very challenging environment particularly in Europe in 2012 we were able to maintain core earnings per share CER, generate net cash inflows of 7 billion before legal settlements and return 6.3 billion to shareholders.
We also made outstanding progress in research and development.
Although reported sales for the year were down 1%, sales were flat adjusting for the disposal of our non-core Consumer Healthcare brands.
This reflects continued strong performance from our growth businesses, helping to offset pressure in Western markets.
In emerging markets, the benefits of investments made to increase our exposure in Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines, as well as Consumer Healthcare, were evident.
Total sales in emerging markets now account for 26% of our business and grew 10% during the year.
In Japan, we continue to strengthen our business through further product launches and our performance continues to improve in our US business, which we have been re-shaping to reflect changing market dynamics and to prepare for the launch of multiple new products.
We continue to view the USA and Japan very positively as markets that reward and are willing to pay for healthcare innovation.
In Europe, we are restructuring our business and evaluating further strategic options to ensure we are able to maximise the value of our current and future portfolio in the region.
In 2012, we also continued to strengthen our core business through acquisitions and equity investments, while delivering targeted divestments to realise value for shareholders.
In R&D, the Group made significant progress in 2012.
We now have six key new products under regulatory review and expect Phase III data on 14 assets in 2013 and 2014.
We are also confident that we can sustain this level of productivity.
In total, over the next three years, we have the potential to launch around 15 new medicines and vaccines globally.

I was very pleased that GSK was again number one in the Access to Medicines ATM Index in 2012, which ranks companies efforts to increase access to medicines across www.
We also expanded our efforts to tackle neglected tropical diseases and supply low-price vaccines for use in the worlds poorest countries.
Looking to the future, our globally diversified sales base and improved R&D output provide a clear platform for growth, with 2013 marking the start of what should be a series of growth years for the Group.
In closing, I would like to thank all our employees, partners and suppliers for their continued commitment and support.
We are more confident than ever that GSK is well placed to deliver innovation and benefits to patients and sustained performance and returns to shareholders.
