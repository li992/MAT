GOODWILL CONTINUED The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates the Group discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and adjusts, if necessary, the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares an annual cash flow forecast derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next three years approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated long-term growth rates of between 2% and 2.5% 2011: 2% and 2.5% representing long-term growth rates based on respective country GDP rates.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast pre-tax cash flows for all CGUs is 15% 2011: 13%.
Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, which also reflects the different risk profile of each CGU.
Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, it takes account of the headroom in managements internal growth targets versus the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.
