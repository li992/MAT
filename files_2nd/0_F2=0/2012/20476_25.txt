Overview Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Other information Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2012 65 3b Segment reporting The Group has four reportable segments, as described below.
These segments represent the principal split of business that is regularly reported to the Groups Board of Directors, which is considered to be the Groups chief operating decision maker in line with IFRS 8, Operating Segments.
UK Car Insurance: The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and other products that supplement the car insurance policy.
It also includes the generation of ancillary income from underwriting car insurance in the UK.
The Directors consider the results of these activities to be reportable as one segment as the activities carried out in generating theincome are not independent of each other and are performed as one business.
This mirrors the approach taken inmanagement reporting.
International Car Insurance: The segment consists of the underwriting of car insurance and the generation of ancillary income from underwriting car insurance outside of the UK.
It specifically covers the Group operations Admiral Seguros in Spain, ConTe in Italy, Lolivier Assurances in France and Elephant Auto in the USA.
None of these operations are reportable on an individual basis, based on the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Price Comparison: The segment relates to the Groups price comparison websites Confused in the UK, Rastreator in Spain and LeLynx inFrance.
The Groups price comparison operation in Italy, Chiarezza was sold in 2012.
Each of the Price Comparison businesses are operating in individual geographical segments but are grouped into one reporting segment as LeLynxand Rastreator do not individually meet the threshold requirements in IFRS 8.
Other: The other segment is designed to be comprised of all other operating segments that do not meet the threshold requirements for individual reporting.
Currently there is only one such segment, the Gladiator commercial van insurance broking operation, and so it is the results and balances of this operation comprises the other segment.
The Group launched a UK Household insurance product at the end of 2012.
There are no transactions relating to household insurance within any of the segments reported below.
Taxes are not allocated across the segments and, as with the corporate activities, are included in the reconciliation tothe Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
An analysis of the Groups revenue and results for the year ended 31 December 2012, by reportable segment are shown below.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are consistent with those presented in the notes tothe financial statements forthe Group.

Segment revenues The UK and International Car Insurance reportable segments derive all insurance premium income from external policyholders.
Revenue within these segments is not derived from an individual policyholder that represents 10% ormore of the Groups total revenue.
The total of Price Comparison revenues from transactions with other reportable segments is 13.0m 2011: 14.9m.
These amounts have not been eliminated on consolidation as the Directors consider that not doing so results in a better overall presentation of the financial statements.
The impact on the financial statements in the current and priorperiod is not material.
There are no other transactions between reportable segments.
Within the UK Car Insurance segment, transactions between the Groups intermediary and the Groups insurance companies relating to vehicle commission totalling 7.0m have not been eliminated from the insurance expenses and other revenue lines in the income statement in order to ensure consistency between the financial statements and key performance indicators quoted in the business review.
There is no profit impact of thenon-elimination.
Revenues from external customers for products and services is consistent with the split of reportable segment revenues as shown above.
Information about geographical locations All material revenues from external customers, and net assets attributed to a foreign country are shown within the International Car Insurance reportable segment shown above.
The revenue and results of the two International Price Comparison businesses, Rastreator and LeLynx are not yet material enough to be presented as a separate segment.

These assets and liabilities are not regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors in the reportable segment format.
There is an asymmetrical allocation of assets and income to the reportable segments, in that the interest earned on cash and cash equivalent assets deployed in the UK Car Insurance, Price Comparison and International Car Insurance segments is not allocated in arriving at segment profits.
This is consistent with regular management reporting.
Eliminations represent inter-segment funding and balances included in trade and other receivables.

Insurance risk primarily involves uncertainty over the occurrence, amount or timing of claims arising on insurance contracts issued.
The key reserving risk is that the frequency and or value of the claims arising exceeds expectation and the value ofinsurance liabilities established.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the management of insurance risk, although as mentioned in note 5, ithasdelegated the task of supervising risk management to the Group Risk Committee.
The Board implements certain policies in order to mitigate and control the level of insurance risk accepted bytheGroup.
These include underwriting partnership arrangements, pricing policies and claims management andadministration policies.
Admiral Group plc 70 Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued A number of the key elements of these policies and procedures are detailed below: t Co-insurance and reinsurance: As noted in the business review, the Group cedes a significant amount of the motor insurance business generated toexternal underwriters.
In 2012, 40% of the UK risk was shared under a co-insurance contract, under which the primary risk isborne by the co-insurer.
A further 35% of the UK risk was ceded under quota share reinsurance contracts.
Co-insurance and reinsurance contracts are also used in the International car insurance businesses.
Furtherdetail can be found in the business review on page 13 and 17.
As well as these proportional arrangements, an excess of loss reinsurance programme is also purchased to protect theGroup against very large individual claims and catastrophe losses.
t Data driven pricing: The Groups underwriting philosophy is focused on a sophisticated data-driven approach to pricing and underwriting and on exploiting the competitive advantages direct insurers enjoy over traditional insurers through: Collating and analysing more comprehensive data from customers: Tight control over the pricing guidelines in order to target profitable business sectors: and Fast and flexible responsiveness to data analysis and market trends.
The Group is committed to establishing premium rates that appropriately price the underwriting risk and exposure.
Rates are set utilising a larger than average number of underwriting criteria.
The Directors believe that there is a strong link between the increase in depth of data that the Group has been able tocollate over time and the lower than average historic reported loss ratios enjoyed by the Group.
t Effective claims management: The Group adopts various claims management strategies designed to ensure that claims are paid at an appropriate level and to minimise the expenses associated with claims management.
These include: An effective, computerised workflow system which along with the appropriate level of resources employed helps reduce the scope for error and avoids significant backlogs : Use of an outbound telephone team to contact third parties aiming to minimise the potential claims costs and to ensure that more third parties utilise the Group approved repairers: and Use of sophisticated and innovative methods to check for fraudulent claims.
Concentration of insurance risk: The Directors do not believe there are significant concentrations of insurance risk.
This is because, although the Group hashistorically written only one line of insurance business, the risks are spread across a large number of people and a wideregional base.

Investments 5a Accounting policies i Investment income: Investment income from financial assets comprises interest income and net gains both realised and unrealised onfinancial assets classified as fair value through profit and loss and interest income on held to maturity deposits.
ii Financial assets investments and receivables: t Initial recognition Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans andreceivables or held to maturity investments.
At initial recognition assets are recognised at fair value and classified according to the purpose for which they wereacquired.
The Groups investments in money market liquidity funds are designated as financial assets at fair value through profitor loss FVTPL at inception.
This designation is permitted under IAS 39, as the investments in money market funds are managed as a group ofassets and internal performance evaluation of this group is conducted on a fair value basis.
The Groups deposits with credit institutions are classified as held to maturity investments, which is consistent withthe intention for which they were purchased.
t Subsequent measurement Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised through the incomestatement.
Deposits with fixed maturities, classified as held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.
Movements in the amortised cost are recognised through the income statement, asare any impairment losses.
Loans and receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest method.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement.
Admiral Group plc 74 Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued t Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether any financial assets or groups of financial assets held atamortised cost, are impaired.
Financial assets are impaired where there is evidence that one or more events occurring after the initial recognition of the asset, may lead to a reduction in the estimated future cash flows arisingfrom the asset.
Objective evidence of impairment may include default on cash flows due from the asset and reported financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty.
t Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from that asset have expired or when the Grouptransfers the asset and all the attaching substantial risks and rewards relating to the asset, to a third party.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term deposits withoriginal maturities of three months or less.
All cash and cash equivalents are measured at amortisedcost.

These funds target a short term cash return with capital security and low volatility and continue to achieve these goals.
The approximate fair value of held to maturity deposits plus short dated debt securities is 562.8m 2011: 280.8m based on a calculation to discount expected cashflows arising at the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The amortised cost carrying amount of receivables is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The Board of Directors has delegated the task of supervising risk management and internal control tothe Risk Committee.
There is also an Investment Committee that makes recommendations to the Board on the Groups investment strategy.
There are several key elements to the risk management environment throughout the Group.
These are detailed in fullin the Corporate Governance statement.
Specific considerations for the risks arising from financial assets and liabilities are detailed below.
t Credit risk The Group defines credit risk as the risk of loss if another party fails to perform its obligations.
The key areas of exposure to credit risk for the Group result through its reinsurance programme, investments, bank deposits and policyholder receivables.
Economic and financial market conditions have led the Directors to consider counterparty exposure more frequently and in significant detail.
The Directors consider that the policies and procedures in place to manage credit exposure continue to be appropriate for the Groups risk appetite, and during 2012 and historically no material credit losses have been experienced by the Group.
There are no specific concentrations of credit risk with respect to investment counterparties due to the structure oftheliquidity funds which invest in a wide range of very short duration, high quality securities.
Cash balances and deposits are placed only with highly rated credit institutions.
The detailed holdings are reviewed regularly by the Investment Committee.
Admiral Group plc 76 Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued To mitigate the risk arising from exposure to reinsurers in the form of reinsurance recoveries and profit commissions, the Group only conducts business with companies of appropriate financial strength.
In addition, most reinsurance contracts are operated on a funds withheld basis, which substantially reduces credit risk, as the Group holds the cashreceived as collateral.
The other principal form of credit risk is in respect of amounts due from policyholders, largely due to the potential fordefault by instalment payers.
The impact of this is mitigated by the large customer base and low average level ofbalance recoverable.
There is also mitigation by the operation of numerous highand lowlevel controls in this area, including payment on policy acceptance as opposed to inception and automated cancellation procedures for policies in default.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December 2012 is 2,221.7m 2011: 1,807.6m being the carrying value of financial assets and cash.
The Group does not use credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate exposure.
The amount of bad debt expense relating to policyholder debt charged to the income statement in 2011and 2012 is insignificant.
There were no significant financial assets that were past due at the close of either 2012 or 2011.
The Groups credit risk exposure to assets with external ratings is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Rating m m Financial institutions Money market funds AAA 1,025.4 862.1 Financial institutions Credit institutions AAA 60.1 Financial institutions Credit institutions AA 169.2 178.2 Financial institutions Credit institutions A 506.4 98.0 Financial institutions Credit institutions BBB 57.1 20.8 Reinsurers AA 117.8 Reinsurers A 196.3 88.3 Reinsurers BBB 6.5 t Interest rate risk The Group considers interest rate risk to be the risk that unfavourable movements in interest rates could adversely impact on the capital values of financial assets and liabilities.
This relates primarily to investments held at fair value.
As noted above, the Group invests in money market liquidity funds, which in turn invest in a mixture of very short dated fixed and variable rate securities, such as cash deposits, certificates of deposits, floating rate notes and other commercial paper.
The funds are not permitted to have an average maturity greater than 60 days and hence are not subject to large movements in yield and value resulting from changes in market interest rates as longer duration fixed income portfolios can experience.
Returns are likely to closely track the LIBID benchmark and hence while the Groups investment return will vary according to market interest rates, the capital value of these investment funds will not beimpacted by rate movements.
The interest rate risk arising is therefore considered to be minimal.
During the year the Group has placed funds into two segregated mandates.
The guidelines of the investments retainthecredit quality of the money market liquidity funds, whilst holding the securities on a hold to maturity basis.
As theduration of the securities is short there is no material interest rate risk relating to these investments.
The Group also holds a number of fixed rate, longer-term deposits with strongly rated credit institutions.
These are classified asheld to maturity and valued at amortised cost.
Therefore neither the capital value of the deposits, or the interest return will be impacted by fluctuations in interest rates.
No sensitivity analysis to interest rates has been presented on the grounds of materiality.
Overview Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Other information Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2012 77 t Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group does not have sufficient, available, financial resources to enable it tomeet its obligations as they fall due, or can only secure them at excessive cost.
The Group is strongly cash-generative due to the large proportion of revenue arising from non-underwriting activity.
Further, as noted above, a significant portion of insurance funds are invested in money market liquidity funds with same day liquidity, meaning that a large proportion of the Group cash and investments are immediately available.
A breakdown of the Groups financial liabilities trade and other payables is shown in note 9.
In terms of the maturity profile of these liabilities, all amounts will mature within 3 6 months of the balance sheet date.
Refer to the maturity profile at the start of this note for further detail.
In practice, the Groups Directors expect actual cash flows to be consistent with this maturity profile except for amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers.
Of the total amounts owed to co-insurers and reinsurers of 723.5m 2011: 579.4m, 609.6m 2011: 432.9m is held under funds withheld arrangements and therefore not expected tobesettled within 12 months.
A maturity analysis for insurance contract liabilities is included in note 4.
The maturity profile for financial assets is included at the start of this note.
The Groups Directors believe that the cashflows arising from these assets will be consistent with this profile.
Liquidity risk is not, therefore considered to be significant.
t Foreign exchange risks Foreign exchange risks arise from unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates that could adversely impact thevaluation of overseas assets.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk through its expanding operations overseas.
Although the relative sizeof the European and International operations means that the risks are relatively small, increasingly volatile foreign exchange rates could result in larger potential gains or losses.
Assets held to fund insurance liabilities are held in the currency of the liabilities, however surplus assets held as regulatory capital in foreign currencies remain exposed.
The Groups exposures to net assets held in euros and dollars at the balance sheet date were 13.3m and 46.7mrespectively.
Fair value For cash at bank and cash deposits, the fair value approximates to the book value due to their short maturity.
Forassets held at fair value through profit and loss, their value equates to level 1 quoted prices in active markets ofthe fair value hierarchy.

Other Revenue 6a Accounting policy i Ancillary and other revenue: Ancillary and other revenue includes revenue earned on the sale of ancillary products, administration and other charges paid by the policyholder, referral fees, revenue from policies paid by instalments and vehicle commission charges paid by coand reinsurers.
Revenue is credited to the income statement over the period matching the Groups obligations to provide services.
Where the Group has no remaining contractual obligations, the revenue is recognised immediately.
An allowance is made for expected cancellations where the customer may be entitled to a refund of ancillary amounts charged.
Commission from price comparison activities and earned by Gladiator is credited to revenue on the sale of the underlying insurancepolicy.

Expenses 7a Accounting policies i Acquisition costs, reinsurer vehicle commission and operating expenses: Acquisition costs incurred in obtaining new and renewal business are charged to the income statement over heperiod in which those premiums are earned.
Vehicle commissions relating to new and renewal business isalsorecognised over the period in which those premiums are earned.
All other operating expenses are chargedtothe income statement in the period that they are incurred.
Insurance contract expenses, which comprise of the acquisition costs, vehicle commissions and operating expenses referred to above are included in the income statement net of recoveries from co-insurers and reinsurers.
ii Employee benefits: Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution personal pension plans for its employees.
The contributions payable tothese schemes are charged in the accounting period to which they relate.
Employee share schemes The Group operates a number of equity settled compensation schemes for its employees.
For schemes commencing 1 January 2004 and after, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of free shares under the schemes is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The total charge expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the free shares granted as determined at the grant date excluding the impact of non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market conditions such as profitability targets as well as staff attrition rates are included in assumptions over the number offree shares to vest under the applicable scheme.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its assumptions on the number of shares to be granted with the impact of any change in the assumptions recognised through income.
Refer to note 7e for further details on share schemes.

The consolidated cash flow statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between profit after tax andcash flows from operating activities.
The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade andother payables line.
i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The current maximum award for each year is 3,000 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period three years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the remuneration policy section of the remuneration report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date inorder to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2012 scheme is 2,149,566 2011scheme: 1,791,234.
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk freereturn RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.
Overview Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Other information Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2012 81 For the 2011 and 2010 schemes, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject tothese performance conditions.
The range of awards is as follows: t If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest t EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests t To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Remuneration report.

Taxation 8a Accounting policy Income tax on the profit or loss for the periods presented comprises current and deferred tax.
i Current tax: Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates that have been enactedor substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respectof previous periods.
Current tax related to items recognised in other comprehensive income is also recognised in other comprehensive income and not in the income statement.
ii Deferred tax: Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes, and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
It is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date, or that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation of property and equipment and share scheme charges.
The resulting deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except in relation to share scheme charges where the amount of tax benefit credited to the income statement is limited to an equivalent credit calculated on the accounting charge.
Any excess is recognised directly in equity.

The average effective rate of tax for 2012 is 24.5% 2011: 26.5%.
It will fall to 23% in April 2013, and is expected to fall to 22% in April 2014 although this change has not yet been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax has therefore been calculated at 23% where the temporary difference is expected to reverse after this date.
The amount of deferred tax expense income recognised in the income statement for each of the temporary differences reported above is: Amounts credited charged to income or expense: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Tax treatment of share scheme charges 1.3 1.9 Capital allowances 0.4 0.2 Carried forward losses 3.1 1.3 Other difference 1.2 0.3 Net deferred tax credited charged to income 3.4 0.7 The difference between the total movement in the deferred tax balance above and the amount charged to income relates to deferred tax on share scheme charges that has been credited directly to equity.
Admiral Group plc 84 Annual Report 2012 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9.
Other assets and other liabilities 9a Accounting policy i Property and equipment, and depreciation All property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write off the cost less residual values of the assets over their useful economic lives.
These useful economic lives are as follows: Motor vehicles 4 years Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 years Computer equipment 2 to 4 years Improvements to short leasehold properties 4 years ii Impairment of property and equipment: In the case of property and equipment, carrying values are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there are any indications of impairment.
If any such indications exist, the assets recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying value.
The carrying value is the higher of the fair value of the asset, less coststo sell and the assets value in use.
iii Leased assets: The rental costs relating to assets held under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classedas finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are included in property and equipment at fair value on acquisition and are depreciated in the same manner as equivalent owned assets.
Finance lease and hire purchase obligations are included in creditors, and the finance costs are spread over the periods of the agreements based on the net amount outstanding.
iv Intangible assets: Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
Goodwill has been recognised in acquisitions of subsidiaries, and represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value ofthenet identifiable assets acquired.
The classification and accounting treatment of acquisitions occurring before 1 January 2004 have not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004 due to the exemption available in IFRS 1 First time adoption.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the transition date on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP, which was tested for impairment at the transition date.
On transition, amortisation of goodwill has ceased as required by IAS 38.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs according to business segment and is reviewed annually for impairment.
The Goodwill held on the balance sheet at 31 December 2012 is allocated solely to the UK car insurance segment.
Impairment of goodwill The annual impairment review involves comparing the carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount byallocating the goodwill to CGUs and recognising an impairment loss if the recoverable amount is lower.
Impairment losses are recognised through the income statement and are not subsequently reversed.
The recoverable amount is the greater of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and the value in use of the CGU.
The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this period are considered, but not included in the calculation.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections in the value in use calculations is 9.0% 2011: 11.3%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, which is in line with the market source: Bloomberg.
Overview Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Other information Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2012 85 The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding growth rates and expected changes in pricing and expenses incurred during the period.
Management estimates growth rates and changes in pricing based on past practices and expected future changes in the market.
The headroom above the goodwill carrying value is very significant, and there is no foreseeable event that would eliminate this margin.
Deferred acquisition costs: Acquisition costs comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the conclusion of insurance contracts.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the proportion of acquisition costs incurred that corresponds to the unearned premiums provision at the balance sheet date.
This balance is held as an intangible asset.
It is amortised over the term of the contract as premium is earned.
Software: Purchased software is recognised as an intangible asset and amortised over its expected useful life generally between two and four years.
