Retirement benefit obligations The Group participates in a number of pension schemes, including defined benefit, defined contribution and personal pension schemes.
The total charge to the income statement for these schemes is shown in the table below: 2012 2011 m m Defined contribution schemes 6.6 6.4 Defined benefit schemes: Lloyds Superannuation Fund 0.7 1.1 Amlin Europe N. V. defined benefit schemes 5.0 4.5 Amlin Re Europe defined benefit schemes 0.7 0.8 6.4 4.2 13.0 10.6 a Defined benefit schemes i The Lloyds Superannuation Fund funded defined benefit scheme Scheme description The scheme is operated as part of the Lloyds Superannuation Fund the Fund.
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyds market.
As a consequence of consolidation in the market, employers closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, during 2012 there were only two 2011: two employers with active members in the Fund.
A large proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund.
The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current active employers are collectively responsible for the funding of the Fund as a whole.
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustee has split the Fund into a number of notional sections.
This is a notional split and has no legal force.
The active employers contributing to the Fund, including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities.
A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer contribute to the Fund Orphan Schemes.
The Group is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes liabilities.
At 31 December 2011, the Trustees allocated the Orphan Scheme liabilities between the two remaining employers.
An actuarial estimate of the allocation of the Groups share was recognised which resulted in an increase in the defined benefit obligations of 34.0 million and an increase in the plan assets of 34.2 million, included in actuarial gains and losses recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2012, there were two employers with active members in the Fund to which the remaining Orphan Schemes liabilities were allocated.
In 2013, it is likely that the Group will become the sole employer with active members in the Fund.
Fund contributions Contributions are paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual.
The rate of contribution agreed with the Trustee is 16% 2011: 16% paid by the employer plus 5% 2011: 5% member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings, and totalled 2.8 million 2011: 2.8 million.
The expected contribution to the fund for the year ending 31 December 2013 is 2.6 million 2012: 2.6 million by the Group and 0.2 million 2012: 0.2 million by plan participants.
The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund are analysed in the table below: 2012 2011 m m Contributions relating to: Annual top up payment 2.0 2.0 Ongoing funding 0.6 0.6 Group share of total payment 2.6 2.6 Funding assessment assumptions The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary.
Contributions are made at the funding rates recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period.
Amounts paid under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other Group companies.
All actuarial amounts quoted below are for the Groups notional share of the scheme liabilities.
The last completed formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2010 and was completed in June 2011 by Mr R N Wharmby, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, and used the projected unit credit actuarial method.
On 30 June 2011, the Group agreed a schedule of contributions with the Trustee.
The schedule requires seven separate annual payments of 2.0 million to the Fund over a period of seven years.

Retirement benefit obligations continued The Group has also entered into an agreement with the Trustee to hold certain funds within an escrow account.
These funds would be transferred to the Trustee in full for the purpose of defined benefit funding if any one of a number of enforcement events within the agreement were to occur.
The Group made two payments of 5.0 million each to the escrow account in July 2011 and June 2012.
A further payment to the escrow account of 4.0 million will be made in June 2013.
The Group considers it unlikely that any one of the enforcement events defined within the agreement will occur.
For the purpose of providing disclosure in accordance with IAS 19, the Group has requested the actuary to update the 2010 valuation to 31 December 2012 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 2012 2011 % pa % pa Discount rate 4.4 4.8 Expected return on plan assets: Equities 7.0 7.3 Bonds 3.6 3.7 Property 6.9 6.8 Diversified growth funds 7.0 7.3 Price inflation 3.0 3.2 Rate of increase in pensions payment: LPI maximum 5% pa 2.8 3.1 LPI minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa 3.3 3.3 LPI maximum 3% pa 2.1 2.5 Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 2.0 2.2 The scheme allows members to continue accruing additional years service under the schemes, but these accruals are generally based on March 2006 pensionable salaries.
Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes.
Therefore, the salary inflation assumption used for the ongoing valuation is now nil% 2011: nil%.
The expected rate of return is based on market expectations for returns for each category of assets over the entire life of the related obligation.
The mortality assumptions used in the latest valuation included the following life expectancies: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Life expectancy years at age 60 for a member currently: Male Female Male Female Aged 60 27.9 29.3 27.7 29.2 Aged 45 29.9 30.9 29.7 30.8 The table below shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation that a change in certain key assumptions would have: Defined benefit obligation impact Assumption change m Increase decrease in discount rate by 0.25% 14.0 16.0 Decrease increase in inflation rate by 0.25% 8.0 8.0 Increase in floor mortality improvements for males of 1.5% and females of 1.25% per annum 5.0 ii Amlin Europe N. V. defined benefit plans Scheme description Amlin Europe N. V. operates defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of its employees.
These plans are insured and are funded partly by means of employee contributions.
Under these plans, benefits are based on years of service and level of salary.
In addition to pension charges, costs of defined benefit plans also include other post-employment benefits such as reimbursement of part of the health insurance premiums and favourable conditions on financial products e. g. mortgage loans, which continue to be granted to employees after retirement.
Fund contributions The expected contribution to the funds during 2013 is 3.4 million 2012: 3.1 million by the Group, and 0.6 million 2012: 0.6 million by the plan participants.

In accordance with Swiss legislation, Amlin Re Europe provides for occupational pension insurance, the regulations of which, as may be amended from time to time, apply to both Amlin Re Europe and the employee.
The insured salary is based on the agreed compensation exclusive of bonus and or other benefits granted by Amlin Re Europe.
The employees pay a portion of the premiums determined in the applicable pension fund regulations.
Fund contributions The expected contribution to the funds during 2013 is 0.7 million 2012: 0.6 million by the Group, and 0.3 million 2012: 0.2 million by the plan participants.

The Funds rules do not allow the Group to receive a refund of contributions in any circumstances.
As such, a liability was recognised at 31 December 2011 to the extent that asset gains arising from the contributions will not be available after they are paid into the Fund.
As at 31 December 2012, no such liability has been recognised because the deficit on the Fund exceeds the asset gains arising from the schedule of future contributions.
