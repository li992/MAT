Remuneration Report Introduction This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Accounting Regulations under the Companies Act 2006.
The report also meets the relevant requirements of the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and describes how the Board has applied the principles relating to Directors remuneration in the UK Corporate Governance Code.
As required by the Act, a resolution to approve the report will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company at which the financial statements will be approved.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Companys members on certain parts of the Directors Remuneration Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of the report have been properly prepared in accordance with the Accounting Regulations.
The report has therefore been divided into separate sections for audited and unaudited information.
Unaudited information Remuneration Committee The Company has established a Remuneration Committee which is constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Code.
The members of the Committee at the year end were Tim Clark, Steve Johnson, Mark Richardson and Jonathan Short, who are all independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Committee is chaired by Tim Clark.
None of the Committee members have any personal financial interest other than as shareholders, conflicts of interests arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in running the business.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board.
In making these recommendations, the Committee consults with the Executive Chairman, Nicholas Vetch, about his proposals, on a range of matters relating to the remuneration of the Executive Directors including the levels of overall remuneration, salary and bonus, and awards and distributions under the share incentive and bonus plans.
Remuneration policy Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and retain Directors of the high calibre required and to reward them for enhancing value to shareholders.
Individual remuneration packages are structured to align rewards with the performance of the Company and the interests of the shareholders.
The main principles are to: ensure that salaries are set at a market competitive level by benchmarking against appropriate external comparators: support a high performance culture by rewarding upper quartile performance with upper quartile reward: maintain a balance of fixed and performance related pay which delivers appropriate rewards over the short, medium and longer term, with an increasing emphasis on longer term rewards based on shares: align long term rewards with shareholder returns by expecting Directors to hold at least 50% of the shares vesting under these plans until a minimum shareholding has been achieved.
The shareholding is expected to be at least 1 times salary for Executive Directors: and ensure that the overall package reflects relevant market practice and takes account of levels of remuneration elsewhere in the Group.
The performance measurement of the Executive Directors and the determination of their annual remuneration package is undertaken by the Committee in consultation with the Executive Chairman, save for discussions on his remuneration package.
The Committee also considers pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group, environmental, social and governance issues and risk when reviewing executive pay quantum and structure.
No Director is involved in setting his own remuneration.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the full Board.
The 2012 remuneration package is not considered to be above market levels for comparable companies.
There are currently five main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and senior management: Element Purpose Operation Salary To provide competitive fixed remuneration that will attract Reviewed every twelve months and benchmarked and retain key employees and reflect their experience and against appropriate market comparators.

47 Remuneration Report continued Executive Directors contracts of service which include details of remuneration will be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.
Each component of Executive remuneration is explained below.
Basic salary Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the beginning of each financial year and when an individual changes position or responsibility.
Appropriate salary levels are set by reference to the performance, experience and responsibilities of each individual concerned and having regard to the prevailing market conditions.
Salaries are reviewed annually with changes taking effect on 1 April each year, taking into account individual performance, market data and levels of increases applicable to other employees in the Company.
The salaries for the Executive Directors for the financial years beginning on 1 April 2011 and 2012 were as follows: Director 1 April 2012 1 April 2011 % increase James Gibson 273,300 267,900 2% Nicholas Vetch 249,200 244,300 2% Adrian Lee 202,300 198,300 2% John Trotman 165,000 150,000 10% The average salary increase across the Group in the year was 2%.
The salary increase for John Trotman reflects his progress in his role, although it should be noted that his salary is still, in the view of the Committee, below market levels.
Annual head office bonuses Executive Directors participate in the Companys annual head office bonus arrangements which were originally established in 2000.
There is no separate annual bonus plan for Executive Directors.
Bonuses are discretionary and are performance related.
They are assessed annually and, determined by the Remuneration Committee and based on corporate performance during the year.
The bonus arrangements are structured so as not to encourage inappropriate risk taking.
The bonuses are directly linked to the Groups profit and operating cash flow performance.
There is no deferrable element of the bonus, and it is non-pensionable.
The maximum bonus potential is 25% of annual basic salary.
The Committee approved the payment of a head office bonus of 10% of basic salary for the head office staff, including the Executive Directors, for the year ended 31 March 2012.
The bonus paid to the Executive Directors for the last 5 financial years are shown in the table below: Year ended Bonus payment 31 March 2012 10% 31 March 2011 10% 31 March 2010 10% 31 March 2009 Bonus waived by the Directors 31 March 2008 10% 3.
Pension arrangements Pension contributions of 10% of basic salary are paid into a personal pension plan for each Director.
Share incentives Long Term Incentive Plan the LTIP Approval was granted by shareholders at the 2004 Annual General Meeting for a Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Remuneration Committee has determined that an incentive plan using an award of nil-priced options is the most appropriate way to provide a competitive and market-related long term equity opportunity.
The principal reasons for the Remuneration Committee favouring the use of nil-priced options are: the greater alignment of Executive reward with shareholder interests: and the reduced volatility of nil-priced options to general share price movements.
Awards are made under the LTIP on an annual basis.
Individual grants of options to Executive Directors since the inception of the LTIP scheme have been determined by the Committee.
All awards to date have been approved by shareholders, through approval of the Companys Remuneration Report.
In respect of the current year and in all future grants to Executive Directors, it is intended that the maximum annual grant of awards will not exceed 100% of a participants annual base salary, except where the Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which justify an award above this limit.
For 2012, it is proposed that the awards made to Nicholas Vetch and James Gibson will be equal to 100% of their individual salaries.
The awards for Adrian Lee and John Trotman will be apportioned equally between them to an aggregate value of 100% of their combined salaries.
This remains at the lower end of the market, particularly in light of salary levels for the Executive Directors.
Share incentives continued The most recent awards are shown in the table below: Director 2011 grant 2010 grant 2009 grant 2008 grant 2007 grant James Gibson 87,807 86,419 76,200 60,000 166,666 Nicholas Vetch 80,072 78,801 69,500 55,000 133,333 Adrian Lee 57,080 63,975 42,300 45,000 50,000 John Trotman 57,080 44,427 27,800 29,000 21,750 The number of ordinary shares issuable pursuant to awards granted under this LTIP and all other employee share schemes adopted by the Company may not be more than 10% of the ordinary share capital in any ten year period.
Any award under the LTIP that does not vest at the end of the specified performance period will lapse.
The extent to which awards granted under the LTIP vest and become exercisable is determined by reference to the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to a comparator group.
The level of vesting is set out below: Total shareholder return performance level Amount of award vesting % Upper Quartile Full vesting 100% Lower Quartile to Upper Quartile Pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 0 to 100% Lower Quartile and below Nil In previous years, median performance was the starting point for zero vesting.
However the Committee has been advised that this is below the market average for comparable companies and has therefore amended the zero vesting point to lower quartile performance.
The LTIP vesting is also subject to the adjusted earnings per share EPS growth over three years exceeding inflation.
This EPS underpin target must be satisfied before any part of the LTIP award can vest.
The Committee uses the performance of companies in the FTSE Real Estate Index as the relevant benchmark of the Companys performance.
The Committee employs a third party to report to it on whether the performance targets in respect of TSR have been met.
The Committee has considered the report on the performance of the 2008 LTIP awards.
This report showed that the awards had partially vested to 85% of their value.
The Committee reserves the right to vary the Performance Condition for future grants provided that, in its reasonable judgement, the new targets are no less challenging in the light of the Companys business circumstances and its internal forecasts.
Sharesave scheme The Groups Sharesave Scheme is open to all employees including Directors with a minimum of six months service and meets HMRC approval requirements, thus enabling all eligible employees the opportunity to acquire shares in the Company in a tax efficient manner.
The Long Term Bonus Performance Plan Background The Committee believes a key strength of the Executive team has been its ability to react quickly to changing market conditions, revising business strategy and direction as needed.
This can be illustrated by the Pramerica joint venture at the end of 2007, the successful early refinancing in 2008 of facilities due to expire in 2010, and securing in April 2012, through the new loan from Aviva, the first ever long-term loan by an insurance company to self storage in Europe.
The Committee received external benchmarking advice from Pricewaterhouse Coopers in 2009.
The benchmarking advice led the Committee to be concerned that the overall remuneration of the Executive Directors was ceasing to be competitive and, in particular, that salaries were at the lower end of a range of comparable companies.
Therefore, rather than increase base salaries and annual bonus potential, the Committee agreed that the most appropriate way to reflect the Group strategy in Executive incentives, was to introduce a new performance based plan, the Long Term Bonus Performance Plan the LTBPP.
The LTBPP was subsequently approved by shareholders at the Companys AGM in July 2009 and Initial Awards were made to the four Executive Directors in August 2009.
The structure of the LTBPP is set out below.
Only limited changes have been made to base salaries since 2009 and annual bonus potential payments remain well below the market median.
The plan involved the making of one award covering a three year period.
The first award is therefore due to vest in August 2012.
Mechanics 1 Summary The Plan is structured as a share plan and operates in a similar way to a deferred bonus.
Awards are subject to performance over a three year period during which the value accruing to participants can be clawed back.
Participants will be partly or wholly rewarded in shares with any shortfall delivered in cash.
Cash shortfall payments under the Plan cannot exceed 50% of any total payout due.
At least 50% of any payout will be in shares and will be subject to a further lock in.
49 Remuneration Report continued 2 Nature of interests and performance conditions Under the Plan, the Executive Directors have been awarded restricted interests in ordinary shares in the Company.
The interest entitles a participant to benefit from the growth in the value if any of a number of ordinary shares in the Company over which the interest is acquired.
The participants interest is capped at growth in value of 2.00 per share measured from the share price at the date of award.
Vesting of interests is subject to performance conditions.
The Committee sets a range of performance conditions each year, both financial and non-financial, which are based on the business plan.
Total shareholder return is not used: this remains the measure for LTIP awards.
The Committee annually identifies suitable indicators of future performance against which Executive Directors should be measured.
The Committee then sets the performance targets for the Plan, on the basis of business needs and priorities it has identified.
At the end of each year, the Committee indicates the extent to which interests have provisionally vested under the Plan on the basis of the performance targets which have been set.
The Committee has the right to adjust targets and, where appropriate, introduce new targets if the business plan is changed.
Where appropriate, the Committee may claw-back any awards that have already provisionally vested if subsequent performance during the three year period is below the targets.
Interests under the Plan will not actually vest until the end of the three year performance period and nothing will be paid out within this three year period other than in exceptional circumstances eg a good leaver.
The Committee feels the flexibility in the Plan allows it to adapt to a rapidly changing environment.
It will also ensure that any gain made by the Executive Directors is commensurate with their performance over the period and the financial and other performance of the Company.
The Plan should avoid the disadvantage inherent in many longer term incentive arrangements, namely being constrained by performance measures set at the outset which subsequently can prove to be out of step with the objectives of the business.
3 Vesting If the performance conditions are satisfied and the awards vest, shares will be transferred to the Executive Directors equal to the growth in value of the shares under award subject to the 2.00 cap on growth in value.
If there is insufficient value in these share interests to deliver the required payout, the Executive Directors will first be entitled to exercise an option to acquire further shares to make up the shortfall, and if this is still insufficient to deliver the required payout, a top-up cash payment will be made.
However, any cash payment cannot exceed 50% of the overall payment due to the Executive Directors.
The maximum payout in shares and cash to the Executive Directors as a whole at the end of the three year period will be up to a total of 3 million.
Based on current salary levels, this represents a maximum potential reward for each Executive Director of circa 110% of current salary for each performance year.
The awards that were approved at the Annual General Meeting in July 2009 were as follows: Number of Maximum shares in which value of Director has award after Director an interest three years James Gibson 500,000 1,000,000 Nicholas Vetch 500,000 1,000,000 Adrian Lee 250,000 500,000 John Trotman 250,000 500,000 As noted above, any payout will be delivered in shares as far as possible.
Shares equal to 50% of the value of any payout after permitted sales to meet tax liabilities will be subject to further restrictions.
The Executive Directors will be required to hold half of these shares for a further year following vesting and the other half for a further two years, less those sold to pay tax.
During this holding period, the Executive Directors will not be entitled to sell their shares.
This ensures that the interests of the Executive Directors and shareholders remain aligned for up to five years.
The performance targets for the LTBPP are not disclosed for the year ahead, given the commercially sensitive nature of a number of the targets.
Each year, the Committee reports on their assessment of the key prior year targets, excluding any that are still commercially sensitive, and whether or not management has been able to meet these targets.
The report on the targets for the year ended 31 March 2011 was included in the annual report for that year.
The report on the targets for the year ended 31 March 2012, which were not amended during the financial year, is summarised in the table overleaf: 50 Objective Committee Comment Grow the Groups annualised free cash flow from 25 million at 31 March The Groups annualised cash flow at 31 March 2012 is 29.2 million.

Obtain a place in the Sunday Times Top 60 Green Companies to Work The Group was ranked 60th in the Sunday Times Top 60 Green for and a top 50 place in the Sunday Times Best 100 Companies to Work for.
The Group was also awarded a Queens Award for Sustainable Development in April 2012.
The Group was placed 67th in the Best 100 Companies to Work for, with over 1,000 companies having applied to enter.
The other targets were met in all material respects.
The assessments made at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010 were that the award for each of those years had vested to 85% of its potential amount.
The Committee considered the performance of the Group and the Executive Directors against the current year targets, and also given this is the final performance year of the plan, the overall performance between 2009 and 2012.
The Committee considers that the targets set in each of the three years have very largely been met and, most importantly, that all of the key targets critical to the performance of the Group have either been met in full or within a reasonable margin.
These key targets include the placing in May 2009, the Groups growth in occupancy, cash flow and earnings over the past three years, and the recent 15 year loan with Aviva.
Looking at the overall performance of the Group and the Executive Directors over the three year period as a whole, the Committee concluded that the objectives of the Group as set out in its business plans had substantially been met.
Following this careful consideration of the performance targets and actual performance of the Group and the Executive Directors, the Committee concluded that the award in respect of the three year period ended 31 March 2012 has therefore vested as to 90% of its total potential amount representing 2.7 million out of a maximum amount of 3 million subject to the restrictions in place.
51 Remuneration Report continued 2012-15 plans The Committee received external benchmarking advice from Pricewaterhouse Coopers in the year, which indicated total Executive remuneration was still significantly below market levels.
The Committee therefore proposes that new awards covering the three year period to 2015 are made to the Executive Directors in 2012 after the Companys AGM to be held in July.
The Committee has given careful consideration to the operation of the LTBPP and its support for the Companys strategy through its focus on achieving a range of KPIs.
The Committee remains of the view that the most appropriate way to ensure that Executive remuneration remains competitive, provides incentive and lock-in and minimises cost to the Company is to make a further round of awards under the LTBPP.
The new awards will be over the same total number of shares as in 2009 1,500,000 shares and again will cover a three year period with vesting in 2015.
The 2009 LTBPP awards involved a loan from the Company's employee benefit trust to fund the acquisition price.
Due to legislative changes, these loans will now be provided by the Company requiring shareholder approval, which is being sought at the AGM.
The loans will be repaid to the Company at vesting.
The proposed awards for 2012 to 2015 are as follows: Number of Maximum shares in value of which Director award after Executive Director has an interest three years James Gibson 487,500 975,000 Nicholas Vetch 337,500 675,000 Adrian Lee 337,500 675,000 John Trotman 337,500 675,000 1,500,000 3,000,000 Directors contracts It is the Companys policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, providing for one years notice.
All Executive Directors have contracts which reflect this policy.
If a contract is terminated at short notice, the Company has not waived any right which it may have at law to require the Executive Director to mitigate his loss although the Company is entitled at its discretion to pay the salary to which the Executive Director would otherwise be entitled, in lieu of notice.
The Directors contracts were amended in the year to bring them up to date with latest changes in practice and legislation.
The dates of the Executive Directors agreements are as follows: Nicholas Vetch 31 May 2011 James Gibson 31 May 2011 Adrian Lee 31 May 2011 John Trotman 31 May 2011 Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors do not have service contracts with the Company.
Their appointments are governed by letters of appointment which are available for inspection on request at the Companys registered office and which will be available for inspection at the Companys AGM.
Each appointment is for a period of up to three years, usually to the date of the AGM at which a resolution to re-appoint the Director would next be put to shareholders, although the continued appointment of all Directors is considered on an annual basis.
In addition, the appointment is terminable by either party giving notice of three months.
The dates of appointment of the Non-Executive Directors are as follows: Philip Burks 30 March 2007 previously an Executive Director Tim Clark 1 August 2008 Mark Richardson 1 July 2008 Jonathan Short 16 February 2000 Steve Johnson 24 September 2010 External appointments The Executive Directors contracts do not allow them to engage in any other business outside the Group except where prior written consent from the Remuneration Committee is received.
The Company recognises that Executive Directors may be invited to become Non-Executive Directors of other companies and that this can help broaden the skills and experience of a Director.
Executive Directors are normally permitted to accept external appointments with the approval of the Board and may retain the fees for this appointment.
Nicholas Vetch is a Non-Executive Director of Blue Self Storage S. L, a Spanish self storage business, and The Local Shopping REIT plc, a UK listed property business.
He receives a Non-Executive fee of 38,000 per annum from Blue Self Storage S. L and 30,000 per annum from The Local Shopping REIT plc.
James Gibson is a Non-Executive Director of AnyJunk Limited: he does not receive any fees for his services.
52 Non-Executive Directors remuneration The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Board taking into account independent surveys of fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of other similar companies.
No further fees for work performed for the Group in respect of membership of the Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees are paid.
Non-Executive Directors cannot participate in any of the Groups share option schemes or Long Term Incentive Plan and are not eligible to join the Groups pension arrangements.
Philip Burks has legacy LTIPs from his time as an Executive Director.

GENERAL INFORMATION Big Yellow Group PLC is a Company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 2 The Deans, Bridge Road, Bagshot, Surrey, GU19 5AT.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Business Review on pages 9 to13.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the economic environment in which the Group operates.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, there were no new or revised Standards or Interpretations that have been adopted that have affected the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results nor the financial position The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in the current year: Revised IAS 24 Related party disclosures: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 IFRS 2010 Improvements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of items of other comprehensive income: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 Amendments to IAS 19 Employee benefits: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Separate financial statements 2011 : effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures 2011 : effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 Improvements 2011 Improvements to IFRSs 2011: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 1 Government Loans: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 With the exception of IFRS 9, IFRS 10, IFRS 11, IFRS 12, IFRS 13, IAS 27 and IAS 28 which the Group is currently evaluating, we do not expect there to be a material impact from the adoption of these standards.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year, are set out below: Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 9 to 21 of the Business and Financial Reviews.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes to the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Business and Financial Reviews, and in the Report on Corporate Governance.
63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2012 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Going concern continued After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2013 and projections contained in the longer term business plan which covers the period to March 2016.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage room is occupied by the customer.
The Group recognises non-storage income over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised over the period for which the services are provided.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after gains and losses on surplus land, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive income, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2012 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant, equipment & owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Freehold improvements 20 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 4 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criterion used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS 40, investment property held leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the statement of comprehensive income of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 13a.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Investment property under construction Investment property under construction is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property under construction are included in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Surplus land Surplus land is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any gains and losses on surplus land are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories, representing the cost of packing materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
B Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
F Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged as an expense to the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the goods or services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements continued a Estimate of fair value of Investment Properties and Investment Property Under Construction The Groups self storage centres and stores under development are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties, including the valuers assessment of the impact of the proposed introduction of VAT self storage, is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Surplus land The Groups surplus land is held in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment and is not valued externally.
The Directors review all surplus land assets for impairment at each balance sheet date, considering all available evidence as to the likely proceeds receivable from the sale of the surplus land.
REVENUE Analysis of the Groups operating revenue can be found below and in the Portfolio Summary on page 22.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there is one segment, which is the provision of self storage and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage and related services which fall within the Group's ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year and prior year.
