The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $307.3 million, including $4.4 million from the Watercryl acquisition see Note 29, and Elementis Surfactants $3.4 million.
There is no goodwill associated with Elementis Chromium.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that reect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs and the Groups long term nancing PQUJPOT O UIJT FYFSDJTF B SBOHF PG EJTDPVOU SBUFT GSPN QFS DFOU UP QFS DFOU QFS DFOU UP QFS DFOU XBT VTFE The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash ows for the following seventeen years based on estimated growth rates of 0-2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangible represents the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the Deuchem and Fancor acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have significant and on-going value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an indefinite useful life.
The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of 5-10 years.
