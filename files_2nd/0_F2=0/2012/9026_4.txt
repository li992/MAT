Numbers of lines have been reducing by 2% p. a. since 2005 06.
This steady decline implies a degree of substitution by both mobile communications and VOIP channels.
External wholesale revenue of 0.4m 2010 11 : nil reflects the contribution from reseller customers within the Hull area.
Resellers are active in business services and accounted for 3000 lines by the end of 2011 12.
Operating costs have been stable year on year : Maintenance costs have extended by 3% 0.2m.
Other historical cost changes arise from increased depreciation charges 0.3m 8% and increased other costs 0.1m 14%, the latter chiefly reflecting an 18% uplift in corporate recharges.
CCA Adjustments : Substantial holding gains, dominated by the Local Loop Infrastructure, are largely attributable to cable and duct valuations which in turn are heavily influenced by cable and labour RPI pricing indices.
Copper cabling declined by 9% and RPI increased by 5% during the year.
The reduction in copper values depressed the holding gain by 0.6m -39%.
Supplementary depreciation offset this by 0.3m 3%.
Product profitability movement, after current cost adjustments, declined 3% reflecting the impact of the holding gain reduction.
Closing capital employed has declined by 2.4m -3% with transmission equipment alone contributing 2.3m of the decline driven by disposal of older assets.
Of current items stock has increased significantly 0.4m 66% due to commencement of network investments while debtors are stable but split with external and internal elements.
Overall costs per line have increased 7.2% year on year due to some increase in maintenance but primarily due to the reduction in holding gains year on year.
