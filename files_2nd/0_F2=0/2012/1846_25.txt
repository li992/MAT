Tax Analysis of the tax charge for the year 2012 2011 Notes m m Current tax UK corporation tax for the year 0.9 Adjustment in respect of previous years 0.2 10.5 1.1 10.5 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 27.3 4.4 Adjustment in respect of previous years 2.3 7.6 Impact of reduction in corporation tax rate 8.7 9.6 16 33.7 12.8 Tax charge for the year 32.6 2.3 In addition to the amount charged to the income statement, a net deferred tax credit of 10.3m 2011: charge of 17.7m was recognised directly inequity note 16.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The tax rate assessed for the year is higher 2011: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 25.5% 2011: 27.5%.
The differences are explained below: 2012 2011 m m Profit loss before tax 100.0 11.5 Profit loss before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 25.5% 2011: 27.5% 25.5 3.2 Effects of: Other items including non-deductible expenses 0.4 Loss on re-measurement of joint venture interest on acquisition of control 2.7 Additional tax relief for land remediation costs 2.0 1.7 Adjustment in respect of previous years 2.5 2.9 Tax in respect of joint ventures 0.2 0.1 Tax on share-based payments 0.4 0.2 Impact of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset 8.7 9.6 Tax charge for the year 32.6 2.3 Legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 29 March 2012.
Accordingly, the current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 25.5% and the closing deferred tax asset has been provided for at a rate of 24% in these financial statements.
An additional reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was enacted within the Finance Act 2012 on 17 July 2012.
As this reduction was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, its effect has not been reflected in these financial statements.
A further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% to 22% on 1 April 2014 has been announced by the Government but has not yet been substantively enacted: therefore its effect has not been reflected in these financial statements.
If the deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2014, the effect of the reduction from 24% to 22% would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by 9.9m.
To the extent that the net deferred tax asset reverses more quickly than this, the impact of the rate reductions onthe net deferred tax asset will be reduced.

Earnings loss per share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 67.4m 2011: loss of 13.8m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by the Employee Benefit Trust which are treated as cancelled, which was 963.9m 2011: 961.4m.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of 67.4m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive share options from the start of the year, giving a figure of979.6m shares.
There was no difference between the basic and diluted loss per share for the Group in the prior year as the Group was loss making.

Goodwill Group m Cost At 1 July 2010, 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 816.7 Accumulated impairment losses At 1 July 2010, 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 24.5 Carrying amount At 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2012 792.2 The Groups goodwill has a carrying value of 792.2m relating to the housebuilding segment.
The goodwill relating to the commercial developments segment, with cost of 24.5m, was fully impaired in the year ended 30 June 2008.
The Group conducts an annual impairment review of goodwill and intangibles together for both the housebuilding and commercial developments segments.
The impairment review was performed at 30 June 2012 and compared the value-in-use of the housebuilding segment with the carrying value of its tangible and intangible assets and allocated goodwill.
The Group allocates any identified impairment first to goodwill and then to assets on a pro-rata basis, which in the case of the Group is its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment.
The value-in-use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of the housebuilding segment.
The first two years of cash flows were determined using the Groups approved detailed site-by-site business plan.
The cash flows for the third to fifth years were determined using Group level internal forecasted cash flows based upon expected volumes, selling prices and margins, taking into account available land purchases and work in progress levels.
The cash flows for year six onwards were extrapolated in perpetuity using an estimated growth rate of 2.5%, which was based upon the expected long-term growth rate of the UK economy.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations were: Discount rate: this is a pre-tax rate reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and risks appropriate to the Groups housebuilding business.
Accordingly the rate of 12.9% 2011: 12.3% is considered by the Directors to be the appropriate pre-tax risk adjusted discount rate being the Groups estimated long-term pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
This rate used in the 30 June 2012 impairment review is calculated using the average capital structure of the Group during the financial year, consistent with the prior year, due to the cyclicality ofthe Groups borrowing requirements.
Expected changes in selling prices for completed houses and the related impact upon operating margin: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions and product type.
For years three to five these have been estimated at aGroup level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Sales volumes: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon local market conditions, land availability and planning permissions.
For years three to five these have been estimated at a Group level based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market taking into account external market forecasts.
Expected changes in site costs to complete: these are determined on a site-by-site basis for the first two years dependent upon the expected costs of completing all aspects of each individual development including any additional costs that are expected to occur due to the business being on an individual development site for longer due to current market conditions.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups goodwill related to the housebuilding segment was not impaired.
The impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 June 2012 was based upon current expectations regarding sales volumes, expected changes in selling prices and site costs to complete in the uncertain conditions within the UK housing market and used a discount rate considered appropriate to the position and risks of the Group.
The result of the impairment review was that the recoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets exceeded its carrying value by 379.1m 2011: 428.5m.
If the UK housing market and expectations regarding its future were to deteriorate with either operating margins reducing by 1.0% per annum 2011:1.5% per annum or the appropriate discount rate were to increase by 1.0% 2011: 1.0% and all other variables were held constant then therecoverable value of goodwill and intangible assets would equal its carrying value.

The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.
At 30 June 2012 an impairment review was conducted using the calculations and assumptions as explained in note 10.
The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-to-business brand operating in niche markets.
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.

These loans are secured by way of a second legal charge on the respective property after the first mortgage.
These loans are held at the present value of expected future cash flows taking into account the estimated market value of the property at the estimated time of repayment.
The income statement includes a net impairment of 11.8m 2011: 16.3m in cost of sales.
The present value of expected future cash flows is calculated using a discount rate consistent with the interest rate payable on a third party second charge loan of a similar amount and duration.
This is considered to be the most appropriate rate as the interest free loans are similar in nature to second charge loans offered by third party financial institutions.
The average discount rate used for year ended 30 June 2012 was 7.5% 2011: 7.0%.
The movement in the discount rate during the year has resulted in a fair value adjustment debit which has been taken through other comprehensive income of 3.4m 2011: credit 2.5m.
The estimated fair value is based on original selling prices, local market conditions with an allowance for low single digit sales price inflation.
TheGroup has also used independent valuation specialists to review and assess the estimated portfolio value.
The repayment profile used to calculate the timing of future cash flows is based on historical data for first time buyers selling their property.
The net impairment of the available for sale financial assets taken through the income statement relates to borrower default including an estimate made for losses incurred that have not yet been reported to the Group by the home owner or the first charge provider and the impact of the decline in UK house prices on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of these assets.

It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this will be subject toa number of variables such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
b Impairment of inventories At 30 June 2012 the Group reviewed the net realisable value of its land and work in progress carrying values of its sites.
The impairment review compared the estimated future net present realisable value of development sites with their balance sheet carrying value.
This review resulted in nil 2011: nil net exceptional impairment charge for the housebuilding business.
Due to performance variations upon individual housebuilding sites, there were gross exceptional impairment charges and reversals of 31.5m 2011: 65.0m.
In addition, due to changes arising from normal trading, such as planning status, there was a net inventory impairment charge of 6.6m 2011: 5.4m included within profit from operations.
There was nil 2011: nil net impairment for the commercial developments business, although there were gross impairment charges and reversals of 3.3m 2011:1.2m due to performance variations upon individual commercial sites.
The key judgements in these reviews were estimating the realisable value of a site which is determined by forecast sales rates, expected sales prices and estimated costs to complete.
Sales prices were estimated on a site-by-site basis based upon local market conditions and took into account the current prices being achieved upon each site for each product type.
In addition, the estimation of future sales prices included an allowance on a site-by-site basis for low single digit sales price inflation in future periods.
The estimation of costs to complete also included an allowance for low single digit build cost inflation in future periods.
Further information regarding these judgements is included within the Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty section on page 85.
In the past six months, in general, the Group has not seen an improvement in underlying prices and has continued to control overall cost inflation.
If the UK housing market were to change beyond management expectations in the future, in particular with regards to the assumptions around likely sales prices and estimated costs to complete, then further adjustments to the carrying value of land and work in progress may be required.
Following these impairments 607.5m 2011: 793.1m of inventories are valued at fair value less costs to sell rather than at historical cost.
c Expensed inventories The value of inventories expensed in 2012 and included in cost of sales was 1,900.5m 2011: 1,696.7m including 18.8m 2011: 11.8m of inventory write-downs incurred in the course of normal trading and a reversal of nil 2011: 0.4m on inventories that were written down in a previous accounting period, but excluding the nil 2011: nil exceptional impairment and 6.6m 2011: 5.4m operating impairment.
The value of inventories written down and recognised as an expense in 2012 totalled 25.4m 2011: 17.2m, being the 6.6m 2011: 5.4m operating impairment and 18.8m 2011: 11.8m incurred in the normal course of trading.
d Company The Company has no inventories.

Financial risk management The principal operational risks of the business are detailed on pages 36 to 39.
The Groups financial assets, financial liabilities and derivative financial instruments are detailed in notes 22, 23 and 24.
The Groups operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.

Financial risk management continued a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and medium-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends inincome.
Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis the Group has apolicy of maintaining headroom of up to 150.0m.
The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
At 30 June 2012, the Group had committed bank and other facilities of 1,091.0m 2011: 1,501.6m and total facilities of 1,137.2m 2011: 1,547.8m.
The Groups drawn debt against these facilities was 342.0m 2011: 405.8m.
This represented 31.3% 2011: 27.0% of available committed facilities at 30 June 2012.
In addition the Group had 150.3m 2011: 72.7m of cash and cash equivalents.
On 6 September 2012, the Group gave voluntary notice to cancel the 90.0m revolving credit facility with effect from 12 September 2012.
The Group was in compliance with its financial covenants at 30 June 2012.
At the date of approval of the financial statements the Groups internal forecasts indicate that it will remain in compliance with these covenants for the foreseeable future being at least twelve months from the date of signing these financial statements.
The Groups objective is to minimise refinancing risk.
The Group therefore has a policy that the average maturity of its committed bank facilities and private placement notes is at least two years on average with a target of three years.
At 30 June 2012, the average maturity of the Groups facilities was 3.7 years 2011: 3.7 years.
The Group maintains certain committed floating rate facilities with banks to ensure sufficient liquidity for its operations.
The undrawn committed facilities available to the Group, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: Group Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 Expiry date m m m m In less than one year 228.5 228.5 In more than one year but not more than two years 90.0 90.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 670.0 770.0 670.0 770.0 In more than five years 100.0 100.0 760.0 1,098.5 760.0 1,098.5 In addition, the Group had 46.2m 2011: 46.2m of undrawn uncommitted facilities available at 30 June 2012.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk i UK housing market risk This section specifically discusses UK housing market risk in the context of the financial instruments in the Group balance sheet.
The Group is subject to the prevailing conditions of the UK economy and the Groups earnings are dependent upon the level of UK house prices.
UKhouse prices are determined by the UK economy and economic conditions including employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence, mortgage availability and competitor pricing.
However, the Group does seek to maintain an appropriate geographic spread of operating divisions and an appropriate product mix to mitigate any risks caused by local economic conditions.
The Group has detailed procedures to manage its market related operational risks which include: a weekly review of key trading indicators, including reservations, sales rates, visitor levels, levels of incentives, competitor activity and cash flow projections: the provision to mortgage providers with complete transparency of house purchase prices alongside any discounts or other incentives in order that they have appropriate information upon which to base their lending decision: and collaboration with key mortgage lenders to ensure that products are appropriate wherever possible for their customers.
The UK housing market affects the valuation of the Groups non-financial assets and liabilities and the critical judgements applied by management inthese financial statements, including the valuation of land and work in progress, goodwill and brands.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market are as follows: Not linked Linked to to UK UK housing housing market market Total Group m m m 2012 Non-derivative financial assets 189.2 177.7 366.9 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,542.4 1,542.4 Derivatives 23.9 23.9 189.2 1,388.6 1,199.4 2011 Non-derivative financial assets 169.4 109.5 278.9 Non-derivative financial liabilities 1,644.0 1,644.0 Derivatives 12.0 12.0 169.4 1,546.5 1,377.1 The value of the Groups available for sale financial assets is directly linked to the UK housing market.
At 30 June 2012 these assets were carried at a fair value of 189.2m 2011: 169.4m.
Further information is set out in note 15.
The Company has no financial assets and liabilities which are directly linked to the UK housing market.
Sensitivity analysis At 30 June 2012, if UK house prices had been 5% lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups house price linked financial assets and liabilities, which are solely available for sale financial assets, would decrease in value, excluding the effects of tax, by 9.7m 2011: 8.1m with a corresponding reduction in both the result for the year and equity.
ii Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk and fixed rate borrowings expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long-term fixed rate funding and medium-term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
The Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks relating to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt and has entered into fixed rate debt in the form of Sterling and US Dollar denominated private placements.
112 BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 25.
Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued ii Interest rate risk continued The Group has a conservative treasury risk management strategy.
The proportion of the Groups median gross borrowings calculated on the latest three-year plan that should be at fixed rates of interest is determined by the average expected interest cover for that period.
The current target is for 30-60% to be at fixed rates of interest.
Due to the cyclicality of our borrowings throughout the year, at 30 June 2012, 61.7% 2011: 99.3% of the Groups gross borrowings were fixed.
Group interest rates are fixed using both swaps and fixed rate debt instruments.
The exposure of the Groups financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Group m m m m 2012 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 106.5 236.8 1,199.1 1,542.4 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 85.5 428.8 1,199.1 1,542.4 2011 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 175.5 230.3 1,238.2 1,644.0 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 16.5 422.3 1,238.2 1,644.0 The exposure of the Companys financial liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities Total Company m m m m 2012 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 108.9 235.5 28.8 373.2 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 83.1 427.5 28.8 373.2 2011 Financial liabilities excluding derivatives 281.8 230.3 34.0 546.1 Impact of interest rate swaps 192.0 192.0 Financial liability exposure to interest rate risk 89.8 422.3 34.0 546.1 Floating interest rates on Sterling borrowings are linked to UK bank rate, LIBOR and money market rates.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to six months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft, committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
The weighted average interest rate for floating rate borrowings in 2012 was 3.5% 2011: 2.4%.
Sterling private placement notes of 65.8m 2011: 65.8m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate Sterling private placement notes for 2012 was 12.0% 2011: 11.9% with, at 30 June 2012 aweighted average period of 6.9 years 2011: 7.9 years for which the rate is fixed.
US Dollar denominated private placement notes of 145.0m 2011: 145.0m were arranged at fixed interest rates and exposed the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes, after the effect of foreign exchange rate swaps, for 2012 was 10.2% 2011: 11.0% with, at 30 June 2012, a weighted average period of 4.9 years 2011: 5.9 years for which the rate is fixed.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2012, if UK interest rates had been 50 basis points higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax profit would decrease increase by 1.6m 2011: 0.4m, the Groups post-tax profit would decrease increase by 1.2m 2011: 0.3m and theGroups equity would decrease increase by 1.2m 2011: 0.3m.

Financial risk management continued b Market risk price risk continued iii Foreign exchange rate risk As at 30 June 2012, the Group has fixed rate US Dollar denominated private placement notes of $267.2m 2011: $267.2m.
In order to mitigate risks associated with the movement in the foreign exchange rate, the Group has a policy of fully hedging the principal of its US Dollar denominated debt and a significant proportion of the interest payments.
The Group therefore entered into foreign exchange swap arrangements on the issue of its US Dollar denominated debt, all of which are designated as cash flow hedges.
Accordingly the Group has no net exposure to foreign currency risk on the principal of its US Dollar debt.
The foreign exchange swaps match 82% of the interest payments and therefore the Group is subject to foreign exchange rate risk upon the remaining 18%.
Details of the Groups foreign exchange swaps are provided in note 24.
Sensitivity analysis In the year ended 30 June 2012, if the US Dollar per Pound Sterling exchange rate had been $0.20 higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups pre-tax profit would decrease increase by 0.3m 2011: 0.7m, the Groups post-tax profit would decrease increase by 0.2m 2011: 0.5m and the Groups equity would decrease increase by 0.2m 2011: 0.5m.
c Credit risk In the majority of cases, the Group receives cash upon legal completion for private sales and receives advance stage payments from Registered Social Landlords for social housing.
The Group has 189.2m 2011: 169.4m of available for sale financial assets which expose it to credit risk, although this asset is spread over a large number of properties.
As such, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Group manages credit risk in the following ways: The Group has a credit policy that is limited to financial institutions with high credit ratings as set by international credit rating agencies and has apolicy determining the maximum permissible exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group only contracts derivative financial instruments with counterparties with which the Group has an ISDA Master Agreement in place.
These agreements permit net settlement, thereby reducing the Groups credit exposure to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure to any counterparty at 30 June 2012 was 42.5m 2011: 15.8m of cash on deposit with a financial institution.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
As at 30 June 2012, the Company was exposed to 556.4m 2011: 780.7m of credit risk in relation to intercompany loans, as well as financial guarantees, performance bonds and the bank borrowings of subsidiary undertakings.
Further details are provided in notes 33 and 34. d Capital risk management cash flow risk The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and meet its liabilities as they fall due whilst maintaining an appropriate capital structure.
The Group manages as capital its equity, as set out in the condensed consolidated statement of changes in shareholders equity, its bank borrowings being overdrafts, loan notes and bank loans and its private placement notes, as set out in note 23.
The management of these operational risks is set out in the principal risks and uncertainties on pages 36 to 39.
In addition, the other methods by which the Group can manage its short-term and long-term capital structure include adjusting the level of ordinary dividends paid to shareholders assuming the Company is paying a dividend, issuing new share capital, arranging debt to meet liability payments, and selling assets to reduce debt.

Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
Defined contribution schemes 2012 2011 m m Contributions during the year Group defined contribution schemes consolidated income statement charge 6.7 6.4 At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.5m 2011: 0.5m, which were paid on or before the due date.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in Great Britain, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme theScheme which, with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions.
Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out at 30 November 2010.
The results of this valuation have been updated to 30June 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The Group has agreed with the Trustees to make contributions to the Scheme of 13.3m per annum until 31 January 2017 to address the Schemes deficit.
The Group also continues to meet the Schemes administration expenses, death inservice premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 1.1m 2011: 1.1m.
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2012 2011 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 4.80% 5.50% Rate of price inflation 2.90% 3.50% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 5.50% 5.40% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 6.10% 5.96% Rate of price inflation 3.50% 3.20% Members are assumed to exchange 15% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the Scheme liabilities: Assumptions Male Female Retired member born in 1935 life expectancy at age 65 24.1 years 26.5 years Non-retired member born in 1965 life expectancy at age 65 25.8 years 28.6 years The base mortality assumptions are based upon the S1NA mortality tables.
The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Schemes membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption.
In 2011 the base mortality assumptions were based upon the PA92 mortality tables.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection, with an underpin on the annual rate of improvement in mortality of 1.25% 2011: 1.0%.

Following this transaction the Group wholly owns these entities.
In accordance with IFRS3 Revised Business Combinations the Group has disposed of its share in the joint venture and acquired the entities as subsidiaries.

Certain subsidiary undertakings have commitments for the purchase of trading stock entered into in the normal course of business.
In the normal course of business the Group has given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds and financial guarantees.

i Incident at Battersea Park Road, London One of the principal subsidiaries within the Group is BDW Trading Limited BDW.
On 26 September 2006 at Battersea Park Road, London, a tower crane supplied to BDW with operator by a third party contractor collapsed.
The collapse of the crane was not contained within the boundaries of the site and the crane operator and a member of the public were killed.
In March 2012, a Jury came to a verdict that the deaths were accidental and issued a narrative with their verdict that made no criticism of BDW.
There is an ongoing criminal investigation by the London Metropolitan Police and the Health and Safety Executive to ascertain whether any of the parties involved are criminally liable for manslaughter or under relevant health and safety legislation.
Although no assurance can be given, the Board has been advised that on the information available as at 11 September 2012, being the last practicable date prior to the publication of the Annual Report and Accounts, the risk of a finding of criminal liability against BDW is low.
ii Incident at Bedfont Azure Lakes On 28 February 2008, a resident was found dead and another resident seriously injured in housing association accommodation at the Bedfont Azure Lakes site, that was developed by BDW.
It is believed that the cause of both the death and the serious injury was carbon monoxide poisoning.
Following investigations by the Police and the Health and Safety Executive criminal proceedings were pursued against the plumbing and heating sub-contractor, and against an individual registered gas engineer.
The criminal charges included alleged manslaughter caused by gross negligence and breach of gas legislation.
The criminal trial against these defendants began in March 2012 and after a trial lasting for circa 75 days the jury returned unanimous verdicts of not guilty against both defendants on all charges.
Following the conclusion of the criminal case an inquest will be arranged.
Civil claims have been made against BDW by both the housing association and by various residents on the estate where the incident occurred.
A number of claims have been settled by the Groups insurers but the remainder are still outstanding and are being dealt with by the Groups insurers, although the extent to which these are recoverable or to which they are covered by the Groups insurance or the insurance of other parties cannot, at present, be clearly ascertained.
iii Barratt American Incorporated A former indirect subsidiary of the Company, Barratt American Incorporated American, is one of a number of defendants in a construction defect claim commenced in California.
The Company has also been named as a defendant in this construction defect claim, as well as in a separate class action claim which arises out of the same alleged facts.
The construction defect claim and the class action claim will be referred to jointly as the Claims.
American was sold in August 2004 and subsequently became insolvent, although it has significant insurance and is represented by counsel.
The Company asserted that the courts in California have no jurisdiction over it.
Ultimately the California Supreme Court disagreed.
Nevertheless, themajority of the events in issue in both of the Claims post-date the 2004 sale and the Company asserts that it had no involvement in these post-sale events.
The Company and the Directors believe that the Company has good defences to both Claims, although the outcome of the Claims remains uncertain and may not be known for some time.
