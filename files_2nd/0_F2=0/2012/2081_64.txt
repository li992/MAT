The purchase price was US$12.0 billion, excluding the assumption of net debt of US$3.8 billion.
Petrohawks operations have been combined with the operations of our Fayetteville shale gas interests, which we acquired in FY2011 for US$4.8 billion, to form our Onshore US business.
3.4 External factors and trends affecting our results The following section describes some of the external factors and trends that have had a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
We operate our business in a dynamic and changing environment and with information that is rarely complete and exact.
We primarily manage the risks discussed in this section under our portfolio management approach, which relies on the effects of diversification, rather than individual risk management programs.
Details of our risk factors may be found in section 1.5.
Details of our financial risk management strategies and financial instruments outstanding at 30 June 2012 may be found in section 1.5.
2 Management of principal risks and in note 28 Financial risk management to the financial statements.
Management monitors particular trends arising from external factors with a view to managing the potential impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.
The following external factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and areas where we make decisions on the basis of information that is incomplete or uncertain.
1 Commodity prices During FY2012, commodity markets were influenced by ongoing, unresolved sovereign debt concerns in Europe, a continuing gradual slowdown in China and uncertainty about the pace and sustainability of the US recovery, among other factors.
In the case of steelmaking raw materials, Chinese demand growth decelerated, and combined with robust supply growth from seaborne sources, resulted in lower raw material prices than the previous year.
The metals commodities attracted lower prices than the previous year as a result of declining demand in Europe and slower demand growth in China.
For energy commodities, geopolitical tensions provided price support for crude oil, while US gas prices declined with unfavourable supply and demand conditions, despite significant coal to gas switching in the power sector.
The following table shows prices of our most significant commodities for the years ended 30 June 2012, 2011 and 2010.
These prices represent selected quoted prices from the relevant sources as indicated.
These prices will differ from the realised prices on the sale of the Groups production due to differences in quotational periods, quality of products, delivery terms and the range of quoted prices that are used for contracting sales in different markets.

Amidst stable underlying high-carbon ferromanganese alloy price decreased by five per cent, demand, LME aluminium stocks rose by nine per cent during FY2012 as global steel production growth rates fell amid weakening as warehouse financing deals remained attractive for investors.
Manganese ore and alloy demand Alumina: The Platts FOB Australia price decreased 21 per cent weakened in the first half of FY2012 as steel output contracted during FY2012 against a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and major alloy exporters made production cuts in response to and oversupply of alumina in the market.

In the energy coal market, FY2012 saw a strong supply side performance by all major producing regions growth was outpaced by increasing supply tonnages coming from Chinese nickel pig iron as well as new production from greenfield that combined with favourable freight rates to ease the delivered cost of coal.
Compounding this was the deterioration in the global projects which began ramping-up.
