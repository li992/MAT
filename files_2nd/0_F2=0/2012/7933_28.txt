The exclusive supply arrangement in Morocco became fully amortised during the year ending 30 September 2011.
All were acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
Intangible amortisation and impairment are included within administrative and other expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of acquired intangible assets are treated as reconciling items between reported operating pro t and adjusted operating pro t. The adjustment comprises the amortisation and impairment charges in respect of goodwill, trademarks and supply agreements.
An impairment charge of 1.2 billion was taken in 2012 in respect of goodwill relating to the Spanish market, which is explained in more detail below.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance 113 Goodwill and intangible assets impairment review Goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs.
For the Tobacco business these are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives is set out below.
2012 2011 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with million Goodwill inde nite lives Goodwill inde nite lives Spain 218 1,511 Other European Union 4,466 117 4,814 126 Americas 1,776 102 1,842 106 Rest of the World 2,663 315 2,868 340 Cuban cigar joint ventures 281 242 291 252 Tobacco 9,404 776 11,326 824 Logistics 1,566 1,688 10,970 776 13,014 824 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 mainly Other European Union and Rest of the World, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Americas and Altadis in 2008 all CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with inde nite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a CGU is based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually and are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line.
These forecasts re ect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix, based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost in ation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
Growth rates and discount rates used The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
2012 2011 Initial Long-term Initial Long-term % growth rate rate growth rate rate Spain 1.7 1.5 10.9 2.7 Other European Union 5.8 1.8 4.2 3.0 Americas 5.0 2.5 10.4 3.0 Rest of the World 12.0 4.0 11.8 3.0 Cuban cigar joint ventures 9.7 4.0 7.6 3.0 Logistics 7.4 1.7 4.3 3.0 Cash ows from the three year plan period are extrapolated out to year five using the growth rate implicit in the three year plan.
Estimated long-term weighted average compound annual growth rates of between 1.5 per cent and 4.0 per cent per annum are used beyond year five.
In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied to cash ows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and extent of cash ows from entry to new markets.
Long-term growth rates are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry speci c factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government scal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
The long-term growth rate for Spain has been reduced in light of current uncertainty over prospects for the Spanish economy.
Other long-term growth rates have also been revised in line with long-term growth trends in the relevant economies.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk pro les of the CGUs.
Pre-tax discount rates in 2012 ranged from 8.5 per cent to 13.1 per cent 2011: 8.7% to 11.3%.
Our impairment projections are prepared under the basis set out in IAS 36 which can differ from our internal plans.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 114 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 11 Intangible Assets continued Spain The Spanish economy has been particularly affected by the euro crisis and the collapse in Spanish property prices, with high unemployment levels, regional and central government fide cits, a banking sector bail-out, and the introduction of austerity measures.
During 2012, and particularly in the second half of the financial year, the Spanish economy has deteriorated further, and we believe the timing of a recovery of the economy has receded while the current level of uncertainty has increased.
In line with these developments we have updated our assumptions to re ect current market data for the purposes of impairment testing, and have consequently increased the discount rate applied to Spain to 13.1 per cent from 10.6 per cent last year and reduced the long-term growth rate to 1.5 per cent from 2.7 per cent last year.
The effect of the macro-economic conditions and the current downward revision of longer term assumptions have together resulted in an impairment of 1.2 billion of the goodwill in our Spanish business.
Further impairment of our Spanish intangible assets could result in the event of an increase in the discount rate, or a reduction in the initial or long-term growth rates, or a reduction in the value of overall cash ows.
An increase of 50 basis points in the discount rate would result in further impairment of 70 million, a reduction in the initial growth rate of 50 basis points in further impairment of 35 million, and a reduction of 50 basis points in the long-term growth rate in a further impairment of 45 million.
A reduction of 5 per cent in overall cash ows would result in a further impairment of 90 million.
Other CGUs The impairment test for Americas indicated headroom of 100 million, and that an impairment would result in the event of either an increase in the discount rate of 25 basis points from 9.9 per cent, or a 75 basis point reduction in the short-term growth rate, or a 30 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate, or a 3 per cent reduction in overall cash ows.
Our assumptions for the performance of the Americas business also take into account the bene ts we expect to arise from actions we have recently taken to strengthen the business, including the integration of our US businesses, a new management team and a revised strategy focused on key growth states.
We have previously reported that a reasonable movement in assumptions for the Cuban cigar joint ventures would result in an impairment.
Due to continued strong growth in revenue and pro tability of the joint ventures there is increased headroom in our impairment calculation.
Accordingly we no longer consider that a reasonable movement in the key assumptions will result in an impairment of this CGU.
For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.

In 2011 certain spare parts and consumables of individually low value were reclassi ed from plant and equipment to other inventory as this better re ects their nature and pattern of usage.
The net book value of these items was 31 million.
Also during 2011 a number of other items were reclassi ed including 8 million, at net book value, of software from xtures and motor vehicles to intangible assets.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.
We estimate that around 120 million 2011: 120 million of leaf tobacco held within raw materials will not be utilised within a year of the balance sheet date.
During 2011 31 million of spare parts were reclassi ed from plant and equipment to other inventories as this better re ects their pattern and nature of usage.

The GTC currently comprises the Group Finance Director and other senior management from Group Finance and Planning, Group Sales, Group Marketing, Investor Communications and Group Treasury.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report which is also provided to the GTC.
Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
Currently, the Groups financial results are principally exposed to gains or losses arising from uctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar exchange rates.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance 119 Translation risk The Group has a policy of managing its balance sheet translation risk by funding material acquisitions and the underlying material business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This also results in foreign currency operating pro ts being partially offset by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency pro ts after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency.
Transaction risk Material costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
After taking into account other US dollar in ows the Group currently does not consider this foreign exchange cash ow risk to be material enough to hedge.
The Groups sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
In order to manage the foreign exchange cash ow risk, and to provide greater certainty as to the amount of sterling available to pay expected future dividends, the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between now and 2015 that will convert expected euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The tables below illustrate the Groups currency exposures arising on financial assets and liabilities held by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currencies and resulting in exchange movements in the income statement and balance sheet.

The above movements in foreign exchange rates are considered to represent reasonably possible changes.
Other larger or smaller changes are also possible.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September.
The sensitivity analysis does not re ect any change to revenue or nonfinance costs that may result from changing exchange rates and ignores any tax effects.
The effect in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to financial instruments that commercially hedge Group exposures, but which are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 although commercially effective see note 20 for hedge accounting.
This value is expected to be substantially offset by related movements through other comprehensive income and, accordingly, any residual gain or loss is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
At 30 September 2012, approximately 24% 2011: 24% of reported net debt was denominated in sterling, 56% in euro 2011: 51% and 20% in US dollars 2011: 25%.
Interest rate risk ow and fair value interest rate risk Cash The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash ow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC.
The Group transacts interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
Historically, the Group chose to convert newly issued xed rate debt into oating rates at the time of issue, executing xing transactions in accordance with the interest rate risk management framework and GTC approval as and when deemed appropriate.
At 30 September 2012, after adjusting for the effect of derivative financial instruments detailed in note 20, 31% 2011: 26% of reported net debt was at a oating rate of interest and 69% 2011: 74% was at a xed rate of interest.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance 121 Interest rate sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the effect on the income statement and other comprehensive income of movements in interest rates related to variable rate financial instruments.

The above movements in interest rates are considered to represent reasonably possible changes.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt and the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio are all constant.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates re ects the effect on net finance costs in respect of the Groups oating rate debt at 30 September, and ignores any tax effects.
Interest rate pro les of financial liabilities The following table sets out the timing of contractual repricing of the underlying borrowings excluding derivative financial instruments but including finance lease liabilities exposed to either xed interest rates or oating interest rates and revises this for the repricing effect of interest rate and cross currency swaps.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be uctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations in uence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Currently, these techniques reduce the expected exposure to this risk to levels considered not material and accordingly, no sensitivity analysis has been presented.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
Trade and other receivables The Group has some signi cant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered necessary.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 15.
Financial instruments The Group has a policy of having no concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions that are in excess of limits agreed by the Board.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversi ed group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
Utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored and to reduce credit exposures, the Group has ISDA Master Agreements with most of its counterparties for financial derivatives, which permit net settlement of assets and liabilities in certain circumstances.
In limited cases, collateral is pledged against derivative financial liabilities and these are supported by an ISDA Credit Support Annex in each case.

The Group considers its maximum aggregate credit risk to be 4,443 million at 30 September 2012 2011: 4,613 million.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, which represents having insuf cient funds to meet the nancing needs of the Group.
To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has suf cient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
To prevent over-reliance on individual sources of liquidity, funding is provided by a range of instruments including bank loans, credit facilities, commercial paper and corporate bonds.
Management routinely perform stress tests and sensitivity analyses on these forecasts, which are subsequently reviewed by the Audit Committee.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 18.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or in some limited cases through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
Available liquidity from subsidiary companies is remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible on a regular basis.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance 123 The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash ows.

The Group fide fines capital as adjusted net debt see note 30 and equity attributable to owners of the parent company see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the ECP Facility and Bank Bridge Facility, with which we have fully complied during both the current period and the prior period.
The Group manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this, including consideration of the return of capital to shareholders through an appropriate mix of share buy backs and dividends.
Fair value estimation and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities less than one year, other than derivatives, are considered to be approximate to their book values.
All derivative financial instruments are valued using techniques based signi cantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates Level 2 classi cation hierarchy of IFRS 7.
Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.
Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value.

These risks are discussed in more detail in note 19.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an ef cient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash ow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance 125 Applied as commercial hedges As mentioned in note 19, interest rate risk on Group borrowings is managed by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and then using derivative financial instruments where necessary to change the debt into the appropriate proportions of xed and oating interest rates in accordance with the interest rate risk management framework.
Interest rate swaps and swaptions The notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into to change newly issued debt into oating rate borrowings was 7,492 million equivalent 2011: 8,291 million.
The fair value of these swaps was a net asset of 788 million 2011: net asset of 582 million.
The interest rates transacted under these swaps are as follows: Sterling denominated: xed rate received varies from 7.5% to 8.7% 2011: 7.5% to 8.7% against a oating rate paid of LIBOR plus 301bps to 511bps 2011: 301bps to 511bps.
Euro denominated: xed rate received varies from 3.9% to 8.0% 2011: 3.9% to 8.0% against a oating rate paid of EURIBOR plus 55bps to 503bps 2011: 55bps to 503bps.
USD denominated: xed rate received varies from 4.2% to 5.5% 2011: 4.2% to 5.5% against a oating rate paid of LIBOR plus 175bps to 285bps 2011: 175bps to 285bps.
The notional amount of interest rate swaps entered into to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk was 7,337 million equivalent 2011: 9,025 million.
The fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 705 million 2011: net liability of 647 million.
The interest rates transacted under these swaps are as follows: Sterling denominated: xed rate paid varies from 3.0% to 5.7% 2011: 3.0% to 6.1% against receiving LIBOR.
Euro denominated: xed rate paid varies from 2.0% to 5.1% 2011: 2.0% to 5.1% against receiving EURIBOR.
US dollar denominated: xed rate paid varies from 1.4% to 4.7% 2011: 1.4% to 4.8% against receiving LIBOR.
Certain of these interest rate swaps have embedded options.
Assumptions have been made based on market information and from counterparties expectations at 30 September 2012 to determine whether, and if so when, such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
The actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions and a cancellation would not result in a cash ow other than in respect of interest outstanding at the cancellation date.
The effect of the cancellation of any of these interest rate swaps would be to reduce the proportion of the Groups borrowings that was at a xed rate, increasing the Groups exposure to cash ow interest rate risk.
Shortly after any such cancellation Group Treasury would, if deemed necessary as part of the management of interest rate risk, transact further interest rate swaps to replace the cancelled swaps.
The embedded options are as follows: 15 million interest rate swap maturing in 2031 where the counterparty has the option to cancel every six months throughout the life of the trade.
This trade is expected to be cancelled in April 2021.
50 million interest rate swap maturing in 2041 where the counterparty has the option to cancel every five years throughout the life of the trade.
1,200 million interest rate swaps maturing in 2013 where the counterparty has the option to cancel every three months throughout the life of the trade.
These trades are not expected to be cancelled before their maturity date.
Additionally, the Group has entered into several forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of 1,135 million equivalent 2011: 2,307 million equivalent with tenors extending between 5 and 10 years, starting between October 2012 and May 2017 2011: April 2012 and May 2017.
The fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 73 million 2011: net liability of 256 million.
During the year, the Group sold options to two counterparties providing them with the right to transact interest rate swaps with notional values of 100 million and 100 million.
The options are available for exercise by the counterparty on 27 March 2014 and 30 April 2014 and if exercised, would result in the Group paying xed rates of 2.79% and 2.72% respectively for 5 years.
The fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 13 million.
The overall effect of interest rate swaps live at 30 September 2012 is to convert 6,202 million equivalent 2011: 6,711 million equivalent of oating borrowings into xed rates in order to manage the Groups exposure to cash ow interest rate risk.
Forward foreign currency contracts The Group has entered into forward foreign currency contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures.
As at 30 September 2012 the notional amount of these contracts was 2,373 million equivalent 2011: 1,608 million equivalent and the fair value of these swaps and contracts was a net asset of 2 million 2011: net liability of 29 million.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 126 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20 Derivative Financial Instruments continued Cross currency swaps The Group has entered into currency swaps to manage foreign exchange cash ow risk associated with converting euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
As at 30 September 2012 the notional amount of these contracts was 2,311 million equivalent 2011: 3,605 million and the fair value of these swaps was a net asset of 9 million 2011: net liability of 257 million.
Principal amounts are exchanged at the start and maturity of these trades.
The Group has entered into currency swaps to convert issued debt into the desired currency and type of interest rate.
As at 30 September 2012 the notional amount of these contracts was 1,828 million equivalent 2011: 2,231 million equivalent and the fair value of these swaps was a net liability of 100 million 2011: net liability of 336 million.
As detailed in note 19, the overall effect of financial derivatives is to convert 6,202 million equivalent 2011: 6,711 million equivalent of oating borrowings into xed rate borrowings.
Designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations At 30 September 2012 external loans with a carrying value of 6,424 million 2011: 5,224 million and US$100 million and cross currency swaps with a notional value of 2,922 million 2011: 4,555 million have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
To the extent that these hedges are effective, gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are recognised as other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intra-group loans with a fair value of 6,792 million 2011: 6,365 million have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations.
During the year, as a result of net investment hedging, foreign exchange gains amounting to 1,143 million 2011: 5 million gain were transferred to reserves through other comprehensive income.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategic Review Performance Risk Governance Financials 128 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities continued During the period, the Group has obtained a ruling from an overseas tax authority con rming the availability of tax losses 539 million previously regarded as not available.
Due to the uncertainty of future taxable pro ts no deferred tax asset has been recognised for these losses.
As at the balance sheet date, deferred tax assets of 593 million 2011: 18 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets, 539 million 2011: nil losses are expected to expire at approximately 60 million per annum between 2013 and 2021, 12 million 2011: 12 million are expected to expire within 5 years and 38 million 2011: nil are expected to expire between 2024 and 2029.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 48 million 2011: 113 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax bene t through future taxable pro ts is probable.
Deferred tax assets of 57 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the credits.
These unrecognised deferred tax assets are expected to expire between 2016 and 2021.
We have reviewed the recoverability of deferred tax assets in an overseas territory in the light of further deterioration in economic indicators and a change in the Groups nancing arrangements.
Consequently, we have impaired deferred tax assets of 55 million relating to losses and tax credits previously recognised on the basis that it is more likely than not that these are not recoverable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 8 billion 2011: 8 billion.
A provision of 6 million 2011: 8 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 92 million from one subsidiary.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The rate of UK corporation tax was reduced by 2 per cent from 26 per cent to 24 per cent from 1 April 2012 and a further reduction to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 was enacted at the balance sheet date.
A further reduction of 1 per cent is expected to be enacted as from 1 April 2014.
The effect of this further reduction of 1 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2012, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by 2 million.
22 Retirement Bene t Schemes The Group operates a number of retirement bene t schemes for its employees, including both fide ned bene t and fide ned contribution schemes.
The Groups two principal schemes are final salary fide ned bene t schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK and Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany.
The UK schemes assets are held in trustee administered funds while the German scheme is unfunded.
The UK fide ned bene t scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 October 2010 and since that date new employees are offered a fide ned contribution scheme instead.
The results of the most recent actuarial valuation for the principal UK scheme have been updated to 30 September 2012 by Towers Watson Limited, actuaries and consultants, in order to determine the amounts to be included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of other schemes of the Group were made as at or updated to 30 September 2012 by the various actuaries to those schemes.

We estimate that a 0.5 per cent decrease increase in the expected return on plan assets would increase decrease the IAS 19 pension expense by approximately 15.1 million.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice that uses published statistics and experience in each territory, and are provided in the table below for the fide ned bene t schemes in the UK and Germany, which in aggregate represent 84 per cent 2011: 84 per cent of the Groups total fide ned bene t scheme obligations at the year end.

The bond return is based on current market yields.
The corporate bond yield has been reduced to allow for an element of default risk.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.
Excluding any self-investment through pooled fund holdings, the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund investments in financial instruments of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC amounted to 3 million 2011: 3 million.

This level of contribution will be reviewed again at the next triennial valuation in 2013 at which time future payments may be increased or decreased.
In relation to the triennial valuation, the assumptions which had the most signi cant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.5 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 5.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2010 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,622 million.
The total assets were suf cient to cover 100 per cent of the bene ts that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were suf cient to cover 88 per cent of the total bene ts that had accrued to members for past service and future service bene ts for current members.

They affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number of markets and have largely been implemented.
The remaining provisions which include employee social plans are expected to be used over the next ten years.
Other provisions principally relate to commercial legal claims and disputes.
The majority of other provisions represent the fair value at acquisition of current and potential Altadis commercial disputes, litigation and duty claims arising in the normal course of business.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise within the next five years.

Share Matching Scheme Awards are made to eligible employees who are invited to invest a proportion of their share matching scheme eligible bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC shares for a period of three years, after which additional shares are awarded on a 1:1 ratio.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards of shares under the LTIP are made to the Executive Directors and senior executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
They vest three years after grant and are subject to performance criteria based on adjusted EPS growth and total shareholder returns compared to the FTSE 100 and a comparator group.
Sharesave Plan Options are granted to eligible employees who participate in a designated savings scheme for a three or five year period.

The vesting period remaining and the exercise price of options outstanding are weighted averages.
Participants in the Sharesave Plan have six months from the maturity date to exercise their option.
Participants in the LTIP have seven years from the end of the vesting period to exercise their option.
The exercise price of the options is xed over the life of each option, except that following the rights issue in 2008, adjustments were made to the share plans outstanding at that time.
In respect of the Share Matching Scheme, the Trustees sold suf cient rights nil paid to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up.
In the case of the Sharesave Plan and LTIP, the number of shares under option or subject to awards was adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.
In the case of the Sharesave Plan the option price was also adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.
Pricing For the purposes of valuing options to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used for the Share Matching Scheme and Sharesave Plan.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash ow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the consolidated financial statements.
In August 2012 Imperial Tobacco Ukraine ITU received a decision from the State Tax Service Department seeking to apply financial sanctions equivalent to approximately 87 million.
The alleged violation is that ITU acted in contravention of the law on state regulation of production and circulation of alcohol and tobacco, by engaging in the wholesale trade of tobacco without the correct licence for the period from July 2011.
ITU led an appeal against the decision in the Circuit Administrative Court in Kiev primarily on the basis that it has at all times held the correct licence to trade and does not engage in wholesale trade in tobacco from its branches.
Hearings took place in September and October 2012, and on 23 October the court upheld ITUs appeal.
