9 Taxation continued Total deferred tax liabilities released as a result of disposals during the year was 0.6m 2011: nil.
The Group has incurred overseas tax losses which, subject to any local restrictions, can be carried forward and offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which they arose.
The Group carries out an annual assessment of the recoverability of these losses and does not think it appropriate at this stage to recognise any deferred tax asset.
If the Group were to recognise these deferred tax assets in their entirety, profits would increase by 5.1m 2011: 4.9m.
Following the enactment of the Finance Act 2009, the Group considers that the receipts of unremitted earnings from overseas entities would be exempt from UK tax and therefore the temporary difference in relation to unremitted earnings is nil.
Tax relief on total interest capitalised amounts to 0.8m 2011: 0.8m.
Factors affecting the tax charge for future years The Finance Act 2011 reduced the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% from 1 April 2011 and to 25% from 1 April 2012.
The effect of the new rate is to reduce the deferred tax provision by a net 9.3m, comprising a credit of 17.0m to the Income Statement, a charge of 8.8m to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, and a reserves movement of 1.1m.
In his budget of 21 March 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an additional 1% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax, with effect from April 2012.
Further changes to corporation tax are also proposed, to reduce the main rate by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 11.4m.
Further tax changes are a reduction from 1 April 2012 in the rate of capital allowances applicable to plant and machinery and to integral features from 20% to 18% and from 10% to 8% respectively.
