At 30 June 2012, the principal acquired brands, all of which are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, are as follows: 2012 2011 Carrying amount of acquired brands Principal markets million million Crown Royal whisky United States 932 909 Captain Morgan Global 765 746 Johnnie Walker whisky Global 625 625 Yeni raki Turkey 598 Shui Jing Fang Chinese white spirit Greater China 538 Smirnoff vodka Global 525 512 Windsor Premier whisky Korea 484 506 Bells whisky South Africa 179 179 Bushmills whiskey United States 144 144 Seagrams 7 Crown whiskey United States 142 139 Zacapa rum Global 122 Seagrams VO whisky United States 121 118 Gordons gin Great Britain 119 119 Old Parr whisky Venezuela 113 111 Cacique rum Spain 112 190 Bundaberg rum Australia 88 90 Tanqueray gin United States 76 74 Romana Sambuca liqueur United States 54 53 White Horse whisky Russia 53 53 Meta beer Ethiopia 52 Other brands 291 237 6,133 4,805 Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and are therefore not amortised.
These brands are protected by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely, in all of the major markets where they are sold.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace, and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
b For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill has been attributed to cash-generating units as follows: 2011 2012 restated million million North America United States 223 204 Europe Western Europe 163 117 Turkey 607 Russia and Eastern Europe 41 43 Africa East Africa 34 32 Africa Regional Markets 97 3 Asia Pacific Greater China 105 Other cash-generating units 42 19 1,312 418 Comparatives have been restated following a revision of the groups reporting segments.
For an explanation of the change in regional structure see note 2.
Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions of businesses and distribution rights and includes synergies arising from cost savings and the opportunity to utilise the groups distribution network to leverage marketing of the acquired products and the extension of the groups portfolio of brands in other markets around the world.
The fair values of the net assets including brands acquired in the Shuijingfang and Meta business combinations in Greater China and Africa Regional Markets, respectively, will be finalised in the year ending 30 June 2013 and as a result the goodwill and its allocation disclosed at 30 June 2012 is provisional.
c Other intangibles comprise principally distribution rights.
In the year ended 30 June 2008, Diageo acquired the global distribution rights in perpetuity for Ketel One vodka products, and the directors believe that it is appropriate to treat these rights as having an indefinite life for accounting purposes.
The carrying value at 30 June 2012 was 1,146 million 2011 1,118 million.
All other distribution rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the distribution arrangements, generally between 10 and 20 years, unless there is an indication that the asset may be impaired, in which case, if necessary, the asset is written down or the amortisation period is reassessed and changed.
Amortisation of other intangible assets is recognised in other operating expenses in the income statement.

Consolidated income statement Impairment testing To ensure that brands, goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are not carried at above their 119 Consolidated recoverable amount, impairment reviews are performed comparing the net carrying value with the recoverable amount using value statement of in use calculations.
For goodwill the recoverable amount is calculated in respect of the cash-generating unit including the attributed comprehensive goodwill.
These calculations are performed annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount income may not be recoverable.
The value in use calculations are based on discounted forecast cash flows and terminal values calculated on 120 the assumption that cash flows continue in perpetuity at the long term growth rate of each country or region.
Consolidated balance sheet The methodology to determine the discount factors and establish the long term growth rates applied in the calculation of the 121 terminal recoverable amount has been revised following a review of best practice.
Values calculated under the former and the revised Consolidated methodology are not materially different.
statement of Cash flows are forecast for each brand, other intangible and cash-generating unit for the financial year, which is approved by changes in equity management and reflects expectations of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and external sources 122 of information.
Consolidated statement of The discount rates used are the weighted average cost of capital which reflect the returns on government bonds issued by triple A cash flows rated countries with a maturity of 10 years, and an equity risk premium adjusted for specific industry and country risks.
Further risk 123 premiums are applied according to managements assessment of the risks in respect of the individual cash flows.
The group applies Accounting policies post-tax discount rates to post-tax cash flows as the valuation calculated using this method closely approximates to applying pre-tax of the group discount rates to pre-tax cash flows.
The long term growth rates applied at the end of the forecast period are the long term annual 127 inflation rate of the country obtained from external sources.
For goodwill, these assumptions are based on the cash-generating unit or Notes to the consolidated group of units to which the goodwill is attributed.
For brands, they are based on a weighted average taking into account the country or financial statements countries where sales are made.
176 For some intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth, driven by Diageos sales, marketing and distribution Auditors report in expertise, which is significantly in excess of the long term growth rates for the applicable countries or regions.
In these circumstances, respect of the company the recoverable amount is calculated based on a five-year detailed plan and extended by up to an additional five to ten years using the annual growth rate of the real gross domestic product GDP of the country or region aggregated with its inflation rate, adjusted to take 177 Company into account circumstances specific to the group.
In the calculation of the terminal recoverable amount, the long term annual inflation balance sheet rate of the country is used as the growth rate.
178 The pre-tax discount rates and long term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: Accounting policies Pre-tax Long term of the company discount growth 180 rate rate Notes to the % % company financial North America United States 9 2 statements Europe Western Europe 12 2 182 Great Britain 8 2 Principal group companies Spain 13 2 Russia and Eastern Europe 12 5 Turkey 17 5 Africa East Africa 20 5 Africa Regional Markets 21 5 South Africa 13 5 Asia Pacific South-East Asia 11 3 Korea 10 3 Australia 10 3 Greater China 10 3 Any impairment writedowns identified are charged to other operating expenses in the income statement.
Included in the total impairment charge of 72 million in the year ended 30 June 2012, an exceptional impairment charge of 59 million is in respect of the Cacique brand.
The principal market for Cacique is Spain where the economy continued to suffer a significant downturn.
The forecast and long term growth assumptions in the Spanish market for Cacique were reduced due to a fall in demand which has resulted in an impairment of the brand value.
The exceptional impairment charge of 39 million in the year ended 30 June 2011 2010 35 million was in respect of Ursus.
Sensitivity to change in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, in particular in relation to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates applied to those cash flows and the expected long term growth rates.
The Cacique brand would be impaired in case of an increase in discount rate of 1ppt, a decrease in long term growth rate of 1ppt and a decrease in annual cash flows of 5% by 10 million, 6 million and 6 million against its current carrying value, respectively.
It remains possible that changes in assumptions could arise in excess of those indicated above.
For all intangibles with an indefinite life, other than the Cacique brand, management has concluded that no reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which it has determined the recoverable amounts would cause their carrying values to exceed their recoverable amounts.
