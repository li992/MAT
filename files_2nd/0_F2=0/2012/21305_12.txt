The strategic report Governance Risk review Financial review Financial statements Risk management Shareholder information Risk review Operational risk All disclosures in this section are unaudited Operational risk Operational risk is defined as the risk of direct or indirect impacts resulting from human factors, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems or external events.
Operational risks are inherent in the Groups business activities and are typical of any large enterprise.
It is not cost effective to attempt to eliminate all operational risks and in any event it would not be possible to do so.
Losses from operational risks of small significance are expected to occur and are accepted as part of the normal course of business.
Those of material significance are rare and the Group seeks to reduce the likelihood of these in accordance with its risk appetite.
The Principal Risk comprises the following Key Risks: CyberSecurity risk, External suppliers, Fraud, Financial reporting, Information, Legal, Product, Payments, People, Premises and security, Regulatory, Taxation, Technology and Transaction operations.
For definitions of these key risks see page 342.
For more information on Legal, Regulatory and Taxation risks please see pages 112, 113 and 115.
Operational risk profile The Barclays operational risk profile in 2012 was dominated by the regulatory penalties in respect of LIBOR and EURIBOR submissions 290m and provisions for PPI 1.6bn and interest rate hedging product redress 850m.
Within operational risk a high proportion of risk events have a low associated financial cost and a very small proportion of operational risk events will have a material impact on results of operations and financial conditions of the Group.
In 2012 74.7% of the Groups net operational risk losses had a value of 50,000 or less 2011: 70.4% and accounted for only 1.3% of the Groups total net loss impact.
The analysis below presents Barclays operational risk events by Basel 2 category.
There has been an increase in the proportion of losses by amount within the Clients, products and business practices category to 92.2% 2011: 65.9%, driven by penalties relating to the industry-wide investigation into the setting of interbank offered rates, provisions for PPI and interest rate hedging product redress.
In 2012, Execution, delivery and process management 46.1% and External fraud 40.8% remain the categories with the highest frequency of events.
Execution, delivery and process management events are common to the banking industry where high volumes of transactions are processed on a daily basis.
These are often fully or partially recovered, resulting in low value net losses.
High volume, low value external fraud events are also consistent with industry experience, driven by debit and credit card fraud.
These remained within the expected levels during 2012.
The Groups operational risk profile is informed by bottom-up risk assessment by business unit and top-down qualitative review from the Operational Risk Committee.
This continues to highlight Clients, products and business practices as a key operational risk exposure.
CyberSecurity risk is an area identified for increased focus which has driven the introduction of a new key risk category and impacts business disruption and system failures and external fraud risk events.
