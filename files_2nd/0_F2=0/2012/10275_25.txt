Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 21 February 2013.
The Company is a limited company incorporated in England and Wales whose shares are publicly traded.
The registered office is located at Victoria House, Victoria Road, Horley, Surrey RH6 7AF, United Kingdom.
2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment properties and, from 1 January 2005, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale, are stated at their fair value.
Hotel properties are stated at cost or deemed cost.
Deemed cost is calculated based on the hotels frozen valuation as at 1 January 2004.
Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The Groups income statement and segmental analysis separately identifies headline operating profit, other operating income and expense, nonoperating income and other separately disclosed items of the Group together with separately disclosed items of joint ventures and associates.
This is in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group.
Headline operating profit may not be comparable to similarly fitted measures used by other companies.
The Directors intend to follow such presentation on a consistent basis.
The financial statements are presented in the Companys functional currency of sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
Since the 2011 Annual Report, the definition of headline operating profit, one of the Groups key performance indicators, has been modified to include the share of tax, interest and non-controlling interests of joint ventures and associates.
The Group believes that the revised definition simplifies the presentation of headline operating profit given to the reader both on the face of the consolidated income statement and in the segmental analysis of operating results.
Comparatives in the consolidated income statement and operating segment information for 31 December 2011 have been restated to reflect the change in definition.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRS.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 31 December 2012. i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.
ii Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities equity accounted investees The Groups investment in its associates and joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but not control over the financial and operating policies.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
Under the equity method, the investment in associates and joint ventures is carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate and joint venture.
Goodwill relating to the associate and joint venture is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised nor individually tested for impairment.
75 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.1 Basis of preparation continued The income statement reflects the share of the results of operations of the associate and joint venture.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate and joint venture, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
The share of profit of associates and joint ventures is shown on the face of the income statement.
This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associates and joint ventures and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates and joint ventures.
The financial statements of the associates and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment loss on the Groups investment in its associates and joint ventures.
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associates and joint ventures is impaired.
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associates and joint ventures and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the income statement.
Upon loss of significant influence over associates and joint ventures, the Group measures and recognises any remaining investment at its fair value.
Any differences between the carrying amount of the associate or joint venture upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal are recognised in the income statement.
Upon loss of joint control and provided the former jointly-controlled entity does not become a subsidiary or associate, the Group measures and recognises its remaining investment at its fair value.
Any difference between the carrying amount of the former jointly-controlled entity upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in the income statement.
When the remaining investment constitutes significant influence, it is accounted for as investment in an associate.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the investee.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
2.2 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except for the following new and amended IFRSs as of 1 January 2012: Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes The adoption of these accounting standards has not had a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
76 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies A Business combinations and goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree.
For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.
This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the date through the income statement.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement either in the income statement or as change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured and its subsequent settlement shall be accounted for within equity.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the Groups net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and are allocated to each of the Groups hotels that are expected to benefit from the combination.
If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are charged to the income statement.
B Foreign currency i Foreign currency translation The financial statements of each of the Groups businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
Transactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreign exchange rate at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
77 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.
C Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
D Hedges i Cash flow hedges When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or non-financial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities When a derivative financial instrument is used as an economic hedge of the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, hedge accounting is not applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
78 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity within translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
E Property, plant and equipment and depreciation i Recognition and measurement Land and buildings other than investment properties are stated at cost, except as allowed under IFRS 1 transition rules, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Any impairment of such properties below depreciated historical cost is charged to the income statement.
Under the transition provisions of IFRS 1, land and buildings which were previously revalued under UK GAAP are measured on the basis of their deemed cost, being their UK GAAP carrying value, including revaluations, as at 1 January 2004. ii Depreciation Freehold land is not depreciated.
All other assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Building core 50 years or lease term if shorter Building surface, nishes and services 30 years or lease term if shorter Plant and machinery 15 20 years Furniture and equipment 10 years Soft furnishings 5 7 years Computer equipment 5 years Software up to 8 years Motor vehicles 4 years No residual values are ascribed to building surface finishes and services.
Residual values ascribed to building core depend on the nature, location and tenure of each property.
iii Subsequent costs Capital expenditure on major projects is recorded separately within property, plant and equipment as capital work in progress.
Once the project is complete the balance is transferred to the appropriate fixed asset categories.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Interest attributable to funds used to finance the construction or acquisition of new hotels or major extensions to existing hotels is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of the hotel core.
Operating supplies, which include china, linen, glass and silverware, are stated at their deemed costs as at 1 January 2008 and subsumed into the costs of the hotel buildings.
Subsequent renewals and replacements of such stocks and new supplies upon initial hotel opening are written off as incurred to the income statement.
F Leases i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The leased asset is initially recorded at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments.
The equivalent liability, categorised as appropriate, is included within current or non-current liabilities.
Assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives.
Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the lease to produce constant rates of return on the outstanding balance.
79 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Rentals payable by the Group under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if payments are not made on the same basis.
In cases where rents comprise a fixed and a variable element, the fixed element only is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis with the variable amounts being charged as they become due.
Lease incentives received are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Rentals receivable by the Group as lessor under operating leases, including the sub-letting of retail outlets within hotel properties, are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term even if the receipts are not made on such a basis.
Costs, including depreciation incurred in earning the lease income, are recognised as an expense.
ii Lease premium On occasion the Group makes and receives initial payments on entering both into long and short leases of land and buildings.
Where payment for leased land is equivalent to the purchase of the freehold interest, the lease is classified as a finance lease.
All other payments for leases of land are classified as operating.
On the statement of financial position, financial lease payment attributable to the land is recorded as property, plant and equipment and for operating leases, the land is recorded as a lease premium prepayment.
Both lease types are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Interest attributable to funds to finance the purchase of lease of land is capitalised gross of tax relief and added to the cost of lease.
In the case of lease premiums received, these are reflected on the statement of financial position as deferred income, appropriately classified between current and non-current liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
G Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than investment properties, inventories, employee benefit assets and deferred tax assets are reviewed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
Where permissible under IFRS, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment had been recognised.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in fair value of the asset below its cost is considered in determining whether the asset is impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
H Investment properties Investment properties held by the Group are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
Any increase or decrease in the fair value on annual revaluation is recognised in the income statement in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
An external independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued, values the portfolio annually.
The fair values are based on market values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation 80 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
The Groups associate undertaking, CDLHT, holds hotel assets which are leased to both the Group and external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreements involved.
For the purposes of the preparation of the Groups financial statements, to the extent that these assets held by CDLHT qualify to be accounted for as investment properties in accordance with IAS 40, the Group equity accounts for its share of CDLHTs fair value change within its overall share of profits from associates.
Such share of fair value change is recorded as a share of other operating income expenses of associates in the Groups income statement.
Where in the Groups view, the indicators of the lease arrangement are of an owner-occupied property, the property is accounted for in the Groups financial statements as part of CDLHTs property, plant and equipment with the Groups share of CDLHTs results for the period incorporating an appropriate depreciation charge.
I Inventories Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
J Development properties Development properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are held-for-sale in the short term and are therefore classified as current assets.
The cost of development properties includes interest and other related expenditure incurred in order to get the asset ready for its intended use.
Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised, on a specific identification basis, as part of the cost of the development property until the completion of development.
Payments received from purchasers arising from pre-sales of the property units prior to the completion are included as deferred income under other financial liabilities in the statement of financial position.
K Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
L Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
M Income tax Income tax on profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: i the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and ii differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
81 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only to the extent that: i the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities: ii the Group intends to settle net: and iii the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
N Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than post-employment plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The share-based incentive schemes allow the Groups employees to acquire shares of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for awards granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model, further details of which are given in note 23.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for equity-settled transactions where vesting is conditional upon a market or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether 82 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms had not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or the employee are not met.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share further details are given in note 11.
O Provisions A provision is recognised on the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Further details on provisions are given in note 24.
P Revenue and its recognition Revenue comprises: s Income from the ownership and operation of hotels recognised at the point at which the accommodation and related services are provided: s Management fees earned from hotels managed by the Group, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
Management fees include a base fee, which is generally a percentage of hotel revenue, and or an incentive fee, which is generally based on the hotels profitability: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the contract: s Franchise fees received in connection with licensing of the Groups brand names, usually under long-term contracts with the hotel owner.
The Group charges franchise royalty fees as a percentage of room revenue: recognised when earned on an accrual basis under the terms of the agreement: s REIT managers management fees earned from CDLHT and recognised on an accrual basis based on the applicable formula as described in note 33: s Income from property rental recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income: and s Development property sales recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed, which is usually when legal title transfers depending on jurisdictions.
83 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.3 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Q Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
R Operating segment information Disclosure of segmental information is principally presented in respect of the Groups geographical segments.
The segments reported reflect the operating information included in internal reports that the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, the Board, regularly reviews.
Further details are given in note 5.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
Discrete financial information is reported to and is reviewed by the CODM on a geographical basis.
Operating segments have Chief Operating Officers COOs or equivalent who are directly accountable for the functioning of their segments and maintain regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the CODM to discuss the operational and financial performance.
The CODM makes decisions about allocation of resources to the regions managed by the COOs.
Segment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items principally comprise interest-bearing loans, borrowings, cash and cash equivalents, net finance expense, taxation balances and corporate expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill.
S Non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale.
Generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to property, plant and equipment and lease premium prepayment, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in the income statement.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
T Other financial assets and liabilities Trade investments are classified as available-for-sale assets and are included under non-current assets within other financial assets.
They are recorded at market value with movements in value taken to equity.
Any impairment to value is recorded in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material less any impairment.
Trade and other payables are stated at their nominal amount discounted if material.
U Related parties For the purpose of these financial statements, parties are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the party making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where the Group and the party are subject to common control or common significant influence.
Related parties may be individuals or other entities.
84 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 3 Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Group evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgements are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies, among others, affect the Groups more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from the Groups estimates and assumptions.
Key estimates and judgements have been made in the following areas: Asset carrying values Management performs an assessment at each balance sheet date of assets across the Group where risk of impairment has been identified.
Key judgement areas include the carrying values of property, plant and equipment and investment properties, investments in and loans to associates and joint ventures, and development properties.
The recovery of these assets is dependent on future cash flows being receivable and the provision of future services or goods by third parties.
Where risk of impairment has been identified an impairment review has been performed on property, plant and equipment, lease premium prepayments and investments in and loans to joint ventures and associates held across the Group on a cash generating basis.
Where appropriate, external evaluations are also undertaken.
The impairment review is performed on a value in use basis which requires estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriate discount rate and appropriate growth rates.
The discount rates used reflect appropriate sensitivities involved in the assessment.
Discount rates used for impaired properties are disclosed in note 12.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Business Review and Strategy on pages 12 to 22.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Business Review Financial on pages 32 to 36 and in the key performance indicators on pages 32 and 33.
In addition, note 22 includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and plans for refinancing maturing facilities are under way.
Cash flow forecasts for the Group have been prepared for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements.
These forecasts reflect an assessment of current market conditions.
The forecasts completed on this basis show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the financial covenants.
In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that market conditions are worse than their current assessment.
Such measures include further reduction in costs and in capital expenditure.
On the basis of the exercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
In assessing whether the Group is a going concern, the Directors follow a review process which is consistent with the principles set out in the guidance published by the Financial Reporting Council: Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009.
85 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Accounting estimates and judgements continued Defined benefit pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans.
As set out in note 23, the calculation of the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligations at each period end is subject to significant estimation.
An appropriately qualified, independent actuary is used to undertake this calculation.
The assumptions made by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The valuation of scheme assets is based on their fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short term, their values may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
In reviewing the work of the independent actuary, management is required to exercise judgement to satisfy themselves that appropriate weight had been afforded to macro economics factors.
Details of the assumptions used are set out in note 23.
Taxation The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions.
After taking appropriate external professional advice, the Group makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measureable.
Investment in CDLHT In 2006, the Group acquired a 39.1% interest in CDLHT, a stapled security listed on Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, comprising a hotel real estate investment trust REIT and a business trust.
The business trust is dormant.
The Groups interest in CDLHT at 31 December 2012 was 35.3%.
CDLHT is not considered to be a special purpose entity under Standing Interpretations Committee 12: Consolidation Special Purpose Entities and the Group does not have, by virtue of its unit holdings, the power to control a majority of the voting rights of the units of CDLHT.
However, as further noted in note 33, the Group acts as REIT Manager through a wholly-owned company under the terms of the trust deed constituting the REIT.
The Directors have therefore given careful consideration to the Groups interest in and relationship with CDLHT for the purposes of assessing whether it should be consolidated in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidation and Separate Financial Statements.
A subsidiary of the Group, M&C REIT Management Limited, in its capacity as REIT Manager, has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
However, there are certain substantive kick-out rights that prevent the Group from exercising the power to control the majority of the Board of the REIT Manager so as to be able to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
Management have judged that the Group does not therefore control CDLHT and it is not a subsidiary of the Group.
Because of the significant influence that the Group has by way of its holding of 35.3% of CDLHT units and representation on the Board of the REIT Manager, the Group equity accounts for its interest in CDLHT as an associate.
Lease backs from CDLHT In July 2006 the Group completed the sale of long leasehold interest in three of its Singapore hotels to CDLHT, an associate and comprising a REIT and a business trust.
These hotels were the Orchard Hotel including the connected shopping centre and M Hotel which were both sold on 75-year leases and Copthorne Kings Hotel for the remaining 61 years of a 99-year lease.
CDLHT also acquired the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel, a Group managed hotel from CDL under a 75-year lease together with a conference centre.
All four hotels excluding the shopping centre were leased back to the Group for an initial term of 20 years, each renewable at the Groups option for an additional term of 20 years.
The conference centre lease was for five years from July 2006 and was renewed for a further five years during 2011.
In May 2011, the Group completed the sale of the remaining term of a 99-year long leasehold interest commencing February 2007 in the Studio M Hotel Singapore to CDLHT.
The hotel was leased back for an initial term of 20 years, renewable at the Groups option for three consecutive terms totalling 50 years.
86 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 3 Accounting estimates and judgements continued Under the terms of the master lease agreements for the four hotels acquired in 2006, and in May 2011 for the Studio M Hotel, the Group is obliged to pay CDLHT an annual rental for the duration of the term initial and extended term of each lease agreement comprising the following: s A fixed rent and service charge for each hotel: and s A variable rent computed based on the sum of 20% 30% for Studio M of each hotels revenue and 20% of each hotels gross operating profit for the prevailing financial year, less the sum of the fixed rent and the service charge.
Should the calculation of the variable rent yield a negative figure, the variable rent is deemed to be zero.
Although the Group has the option to lease each building asset for a further period of 20-50 years, there remains a substantial proportion of the assets economic life for which the Group will not benefit from the asset.
In addition, the present value of the minimum lease payments over the potential term of the leases do not constitute substantially all of the fair value of the leased assets, and the variable rent structure is such that the Group does not retain significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
Accordingly, the Group has classified the lease-back arrangements as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.
Any prepaid operating land lease income arising from the sale of hotels is recognised on the statement of financial position as deferred income, and is amortised over the 75-year term of the lease.
At 31 December 2012, an amount of 116.8m 2011: 115.2m is recognised in the statement of financial position as deferred income, 115.1m 2011: 113.5m in non-current liabilities and 1.7m 2011: 1.7m in trade and other payables and an amount of 1.7m 2011: 1.7m has been credited to the 2012 consolidated income statement.
In relation to profit recorded on disposals in 2011, and in accordance with the Groups accounting policy, unrealised gains resulting from transactions between the Group and associate or joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.
In the case of the sale and leaseback of the Studio M Hotel on 3 May 2011 to CDLHT for a cash consideration of S$154.0m 75.7m, it gave rise to a total realised pre-tax profit from the disposal of S$35.4 17.4m.
Total unrealised pre-tax profit from the disposal of S$19.1m 9.4m has been credited to the statement of financial position as investment in joint ventures and associates, arising from the Groups then 35.1% interest in the stapled securities of CDLHT.
Investment properties The Group holds a number of investment properties and accounts for such properties in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2.3H.
CDLHT owns hotel assets which are leased to both the Group and external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreement involved.
The Group accounts for such hotel assets in its financial statements in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2.3H.
Judgement is required in assessing whether the relevant hotel assets held by CDLHT are owner-occupied or not, for the purposes of assessing whether IAS 40 Investment Property is applicable and whether therefore, accounting for the relevant hotels as investment properties is appropriate for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
The question of whether or not a property is owner-occupied is a matter of judgement, involving consideration of various factors such as, the length of the agreement involved, the powers of intervention and level of influence on financial and operating decisions held by the Group or CDLHT, and the extent of the Group or CDLHTs interest in the profits and cash flows generated by the relevant properties.
Where the indicators are such that on balance, CDLHT is, in the Groups opinion, shown to be a passive investor, the relevant hotel property is accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 and the Group accounts for its share of the fair value change through the income statement as a share of other operating income expense of the associate.
Where indicators are of an owner-occupied property, the hotel is classified as part of CDLHTs property, plant and equipment with the Groups share of CDLHTs results for the period incorporating an appropriate depreciation charge.
87 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Accounting estimates and judgements continued Land leases classification The Group holds a number of hotels with leases of land that are determined to have an indefinite economic life.
These are classified as a finance lease, even if at the end of the lease term title does not pass to the lessee.
In determining the lease of land status as to finance or operating lease the following factors were considered: s transfer of ownership s purchase options s present value of minimum lease payments in comparison to fair value of land 4 New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The following EU-endorsed new standards and amendments to standards have been issued, but are not yet effective: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Except for IFRS 10 and Amendments to IAS 19 IAS 19R, the adoption of these amendments is not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Management are still assessing the potential impact of IFRS 10 on the consolidated financial statements of the Group and it is estimated that had IAS 19R been applied in 2012, the net pension expense reported for the UK Scheme within the consolidated income statement would have increased by around 0.15m.

b Impairment As at the end of 2012, the Directors undertook their annual review of the carrying value of hotels and property assets for indication of impairment and where appropriate, external valuations were also undertaken.
As a result of this review, no impairment charge was made for the hotels and property assets for the year ended 31 December 2012.
As for the financial year ended 31 December 2011, a total impairment charge of 29.4m was made, consisting of 15.8m in relation to eight Regional UK hotels in Rest of Europe, 8.2m for four hotels in Regional US, 1.0m in relation to one hotel in New Zealand and 4.4m in relation to land in India within Rest of Asia.
A 1.4m 2011: 0.5m impairment charge was made during the year ended 31 December 2012 relating to interest on shareholder loans to the Groups 50% investment in Bangkok.

Corporation, a Philippines based company principally providing management services to Grand Plaza Hotel Corporation, owner of The Heritage Hotel Manila in the Philippines.
e Gain arising on disposal of properties In 2012, a settlement was reached with the insurers in relation to Copthorne Hotel Christchurch Central which is one of the hotels affected by the New Zealand earthquake.
A gain of 10.5m which was the difference between the compensation received and the carrying value of the freehold building was recognised by the Group.
In 2011, another hotel which was also affected by the New Zealand earthquake namely the Copthorne Hotel Christchurch City was demolished and, accordingly, the net book value was fully written down.
A settlement was reached with the insurers and owner on the building and assets and the funds were received in 2011.
Consequently, 1.2m was recognised as a gain arising on disposal of leasehold property in the income statement.
f Gain on disposal of stapled securities in CDLHT During the year ended 31 December 2012, the Group disposed of 2,849,000 2011: 760,000 stapled securities in CDLHT for S$5.6m or 2.8m 2011: S$1.6m or 0.8m which net of the carrying value of the stapled securities and the dilution impact totalling S$4.4m or 2.2m 2011: S$1.2m or 0.6m resulted in a net gain of S$1.2m or 0.6m 2011: S$0.4m or 0.2m.

With regard to the UK, a reduction to 24% in the rate applicable from 1 April 2012, and a further reduction to 23% in the rate applicable from 1 April 2013 were substantially enacted during the year and this has reduced the deferred tax liability as at 31 December 2012, now calculated at 23%.
The UK budget on 21 March 2012 also announced further annual reductions in rate by 1% to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The UK Governments autumn statement on 5 December 2012 announced further annual reductions in rate by 1% to 21% by 1 April 2014.
If enacted, such further reductions in rate would further reduce the future tax charge and deferred tax liabilities, the impact of which has not been fully assessed but is not anticipated to have a material impact on the financial statements.
97 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10 Income tax expense continued Adjustments in respect of prior years The Groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the Groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The geographical complexity of the Groups structure makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and it is often dependent on the efficacy of the legal processes in the relevant tax jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

The CGUs are individual hotels.
The carrying value of individual hotels was compared to the recoverable amount of the hotels, which was predominantly based on value-in-use.
For 2012, where indicators of impairment were present, the Group estimated value-in-use through creation of discounted cash flow models, based on future trading performance expected by management.
The underlying basis for the impairment model involves each hotels projected cash flow for the financial year ending 31 December 2013, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions in respect of revenue growth principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth and major expense lines.
Where appropriate, the Directors sought guidance on value through a registered independent appraiser with an appropriately recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the hotel being valued.
On the basis of both external and internal valuations in 2012, the Group recorded no impairment charge.
For 2011, the Group recorded an impairment charge of 29.4m.
The 29.4m impairment charge was made in relation to eight Regional UK hotels, four Regional US hotels and one New Zealand hotel all primarily as a result of reduced trading performance, and land in India following a decision not to proceed with building two hotels as a result of changing market conditions.
b Land and buildings Land and buildings includes long leasehold building assets with a book value of 431.0m 2011: 445.0m.
The net book value of land and buildings held under short leases was 39.4m 2011: 54.3m, in respect of which depreciation of 3.5m 2011: 5.7m was charged during the year.
Interest of 0.8m 2011: nil has been capitalised within land and buildings during the year.
The cumulative capitalised interest within land and buildings is 5.2m 2011: 4.4m.
c Pledged assets At year-end, the net book value of assets pledged as collateral for secured loans was 288.4m 2011: 288.6m.
The security for the loans is by way of charges on the properties of Group companies concerned.
d Key assumptions used by the external appraisers The key assumptions used were as follows: Pre-tax discount rate The discount rate is based on the country in which the hotel is located and is adjusted for risks associated with the hotel.
Discount rates ranged from 9.5% to 15.0% in the US, 8.5% to 12.5% in Europe, 9.5% to 14% in Asia and 10.8% to 14% in New Zealand.
Occupancy rate The occupancy growth rates ranged from 0% to 18% in the US, 0% to 19% in Europe, 0% to 2% in Asia and 0% to 1% in New Zealand.
Average room rate The average room rate growth ranged from 0% to 15% in the US, 3% to 13% in Europe, 1% to 17% in Asia and 1% to 4% in New Zealand.
e Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and revenue growth assumptions.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonable possible change in a single factor could result in impairment in certain hotels in Regional UK, Regional US, Asia and New Zealand as their fair value currently exceeds their carrying value only by a small percentage.

107 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, with credit checks performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current creditworthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short-term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board, such that the exposure to a single counterparty is minimised.

Of the Groups total facilities of 652.2m, 290.2m matures during 2013, comprising 81.0m committed revolving credit facilities of which 50.0m is currently undrawn, 65.4m of uncommitted facilities and overdrafts subject to annual renewal, 136.9m unsecured bonds and 6.9m secured term loans.
Plans for the refinancing of maturing facilities are under way.
113 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued c Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below.
i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective Group entities.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, New Taiwan dollars, Korean won, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen and Euro.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets are designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Net investment hedging The Group has US$165.0m 2011: US$175.0m US dollar loans, S$50.0m 2011: S$202.0m Singapore dollar loans and JPY2,373.3m 2011: JPY2,373.3m Japanese yen loans designated as hedges of corresponding respective proportions of its net investment in foreign operations whose functional currency are US dollars, Singapore dollars and Japanese yen.
The risk being hedged is the foreign currency exposure on the carrying amount of the net assets of the foreign operation upon consolidation.
The fair value of the hedging instruments as at 31 December 2012 was 144.7m 2011: 230.3m.
There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement that arose from hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
An analysis of borrowings by currency and their fair values as at 31 December is given below: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Singapore dollar 25.3 25.3 99.4 99.4 US dollar 178.1 178.1 177.1 177.1 New Zealand dollar 33.9 33.9 31.8 31.8 Chinese renminbi 43.3 43.3 51.7 51.7 Japanese yen 63.9 63.9 72.4 72.4 344.5 344.5 432.4 432.4 114 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 22 Financial instruments continued Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or short-term forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.
Further details of foreign exchange derivatives in place at 31 December 2012 are provided below.
Cash flow hedges A number of forward cross currency swaps were executed in February 2010 to hedge the foreign currency risk in respect of the repayment in February 2013 of a US$30m loan using Korean won.
This loan was extended to a subsidiary in Korea, whose functional currency is Korean won.
The proceeds of the US dollar loan were converted into Korean won on inception, and the risk being hedged is the variability of the cash flow associated with the repayment of the US$30m loan principal on its maturity date in February 2013, arising from movement of Korean won against the US dollar over that three-year period.
The hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, which are considered to be highly effective.
The carrying value of the hedging instruments is restated to its fair value at each reporting date, with the effective portion of changes in fair value since inception being taken to a cash flow hedge reserve.
The loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of the change in fair value of these hedging instruments was 1.6m 2011: 0.2m gain.
Amounts recognised in equity are recycled to the income statement to offset gains and losses when the underlying debt instrument is retranslated at the exchange rate applicable at each period end, and there was no ineffectiveness recognised in the year as a charge in the consolidated income statement.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate Sterling 2012 2011 2012 2011 US dollar 1.589 1.606 1.614 1.572 Singapore dollar 1.985 2.011 1.973 2.030 New Taiwan dollar 46.713 46.979 46.865 46.644 New Zealand dollar 1.960 2.011 1.966 2.018 Malaysian ringgit 4.913 4.895 4.945 4.974 Korean won 1,785.34 1,771.54 1,729.19 1,808.82 Chinese renminbi 9.961 10.269 10.066 9.762 Euro 1.229 1.149 1.218 1.199 Japanese yen 126.452 127.259 138.262 121.892 115 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis With respect to the Groups foreign currency exposure, and assuming that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant, it is estimated that a 10% strengthening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: 10% would have increased decreased equity and profit before tax by the amounts shown below: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 profit profit Equity before tax Equity before tax m m m m US dollar 12.8 0.8 29.8 0.2 Singapore dollar 11.4 5.3 45.9 7.1 New Taiwan dollar 0.5 1.1 New Zealand dollar 3.7 1.0 Malaysian ringgit 0.6 3.9 Korean won 1.4 1.0 Euro 0.2 0.7 Chinese renminbi 1.0 1.2 0.2 Hong Kong dollar 1.5 0.7 1.5 Japanese yen 0.1 Thai baht 1.4 0.1 1.3 0.1 21.8 13.7 72.5 15.9 A 10% weakening of sterling against the above currencies at 31 December 2012 31 December 2011: 10% would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
ii Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Where used, interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups consolidated statement of financial position.
Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2012 are provided below.
Cash flow hedges Borrowings at floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps to fix the interest relating to the payment of quarterly interest charges arising on floating rate unsecured bonds totalling US$50m, and designated these as cash flow hedges.
The risk being hedged is the variability of cash flows arising from movements in interest rates.
The hedges are in place until the bonds mature in March 2013.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2012 was a 0.1m liability 2011: 0.3m liability.
The cash flows occur on a quarterly basis until the loan balance matures in March 2013 and the hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, which are considered to be highly effective.

There was no ineffectiveness recognised in the consolidated income statement that arose from this cash flow hedge.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of one percentage point in the average interest rates applicable to variable rate instruments for the year would have increased decreased the Groups profit before tax for the year as shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 1% increase 1% decrease 1% increase 1% decrease m m m m Variable rate financial assets 2.6 2.6 2.3 2.3 Variable rate financial liabilities 2.8 2.8 3.7 3.7 Cash ow sensitivity net 0.2 0.2 1.4 1.4 d Fair value Set out below is a comparison of the fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments by category.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps bank valuations are used.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
Available-for-sale financial assets unquoted equity investments Fair value is estimated using appropriate valuation techniques.
Fair value hierarchy As at 31 December 2012, the Group held certain financial instruments measured at fair value.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: techniques that use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets measured at fair value m m m m Available-for-sale financial assets Unquoted equity investments available-for-sale 4.6 4.6 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 m m m m Available-for-sale financial assets Unquoted equity investments available-for-sale 4.6 4.6 118 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated Performance Governance financial statements Company financial statements Further information 22 Financial instruments continued 2012 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities measured at fair value m m m m Other current financial liabilities Interest rate swaps designated as cash ow hedges 0.1 0.1 Forward cross currency contracts designated as cash ow hedges 2.3 2.3 2.4 2.4 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities measured at fair value m m m m Other current financial liabilities Interest rate swaps designated as cash ow hedges 0.3 0.3 Forward cross currency contracts designated as cash ow hedges 0.6 0.6 0.9 0.9 During the year ended 31 December 2012, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measures.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Companys objective for managing its capital is to ensure that Group entities will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders, as well as sustaining the future development of its business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may alter the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, draw down additional debt or reduce debt.
The Groups capital structure consists of debt, which includes the loans and borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 20 and the equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
23 Employee benefits Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below.
United Kingdom The pension arrangements in the United Kingdom operate under the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan, which was set up in 1993.
The plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan, both with different categories of membership.
The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the same time rights to a guaranteed minimum pension GMP under the defined contribution scheme also ceased.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2011 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2012.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 5.0% of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of 3.0m per annum to reduce the Plans deficit.
119 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Employee benefits continued As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
At 31 December 2011 the defined contribution plan section relating to GMP underpin did not have sufficient assets to meet the GMP liabilities.
There was a deficit of 2.4m on the 7.5m defined contribution plan assets relating to those members with a GMP.
As such this section of the plan is now accounted for as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19 as it exhibits the traits of a defined benefit plan.
The impact of this in 2011 is shown in the analysis below which in summary is to introduce 7.5m into both UK plan assets and UK plan liabilities and, additionally, to record an actuarial loss of 2.4m within defined benefit losses.
At 31 December 2012, the plan has been included as part of the overall defined benefit scheme and not separately disclosed.
South Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2012.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were 6% 2011: 6% of the employees earnings.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 UK South Korea Taiwan UK South Korea Taiwan Ination rate 2.9% 3.1% Discount rate 4.4% 3.8% 1.8% 4.7% 4.8% 1.9% Rate of salary increase 3.4% 5.0% 3.0% 3.6% 4.0% 2.5% Rate of pension increases 2.9% 3.1% Rate of revaluation 2.1% 2.1% Annual expected return on plan assets 5.1% 4.2% 1.8% 5.1% 4.2% 1.8% The discount rate used in respect of the UK pension scheme of 4.4% 2011: 4.7% was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice.
