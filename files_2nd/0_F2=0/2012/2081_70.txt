6 Exploration and development of resources continued Over the past three years, exploration expense has increased, with a total expense of US$3.8 billion.
Exploration expense for each CSG over the three-year period is set out below.

During FY2012, Minerals greenfield exploration has focused on copper targets in South America, nickel and copper targets in Australia and iron ore and potash targets globally.
Petroleum exploration activities focused on offshore Western Australia, the Gulf of Mexico, South East Asia and our recently acquired Onshore US business.
Exploration expenditure for FY2013 is expected to be approximately US$1.5 billion, of which approximately half is for offshore oil and gas and the other half is for Minerals.
7 Interest rates We are exposed to interest rate risk on our outstanding borrowings and investments.
Our policy on interest rate exposure is for interest on our borrowings to be on a US dollar floating interest rate basis.
Deviation from our policy requires the prior approval of our Financial Risk Management Committee and is managed within our Cash Flow at Risk CFaR framework, which is described in note 28 Financial risk management to the financial statements.
When required under this strategy, we use interest rate swaps, including cross currency interest rate swaps, to convert a fixed rate exposure to a floating rate exposure, as well as using swaptions to manage the fixed interest rate exposure.
As at 30 June 2012, the Group holds US$4.3 billion 2011: US$827 million of centrally managed fixed interest rate borrowings, as well as US$4.0 billion 2011: US$650 million of other fixed interest rate borrowings, that have not been swapped to floating interest rates, arising from debt raised during FY2012, debt assumed as part of the acquisition of Petrohawk and debt raised prior to the DLC merger.
Our earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating interest rate component of the Groups net borrowings.
Based on the net debt position as at 30 June 2012, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will decrease the Groups profit after taxation by US$103 million 2011: decrease of US$25 million.
This assumes that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed floating mix and balances are constant over the year.
However, interest rates and the net debt profile of the Group may not remain constant in the coming financial year and therefore such sensitivity analysis should be used with care.
8 Freight markets The bulk freight market is typically categorised by the size of the vessel.
Capesize vessels are typically classified as having deadweight above 150 thousand deadweight tonnes kdwt compared with Panamax and Supramax vessels, which are 60 to 100 kdwt and 50 to 60 kdwt, respectively.
Freight rates have dropped considerably over the three-year period as set out below.
2012 2011 2010 Year ended 30 June Closing Closing Closing Rate US$ per day Capesize average 4 Time Charter rate 3,988 12,732 24,239 Panamax average 4 Time Charter rate 7,835 12,823 22,113 Supramax average 6 Time Charter rate 13,145 13,682 21,607 Although the demand for bulk commodities was strong, the freight market experienced oversupply due to the many newly built vessels entering the market.
The total dry bulk fleet grew by 14 per cent year-on-year in CY2011, thereby outpacing seaborne trade growth.
9 Health, safety, environment and community We are subject to extensive regulation surrounding the health and safety of our people and the environment.
We make every effort to comply with the regulations and, where less stringent than our standards, exceed applicable legal and other requirements.
However, regulatory standards and community expectations are constantly evolving.
As a result, we may be exposed to increased litigation, compliance costs and unforeseen environmental rehabilitation expenses, despite our best efforts to work with governments, community groups and scientists to keep pace with regulations, law and public expectations.
Further information about our compliance with HSEC regulations can be found in section 2.8 Sustainability.
10 Insurance During FY2012, we maintained an insurance program with policies encompassing property damage, business interruption, sabotage and terrorism, marine cargo, construction, public and certain other liabilities and directors and officers exposures.
The program includes a combination of self-insurance via subsidiary captive insurance companies, industry mutuals and external market reinsurance above our reinsurance level.
Mandates are established as to risk retention levels, policy cover and, where applicable, reinsurance counter parties.
As part of our portfolio risk management approach, we regularly conduct an assessment of maximum foreseeable loss potential, cash flow at risk, loss experience, claims received and insurance premiums paid, and will make adjustments to the balance of self-insurance and reinsurance as required.
