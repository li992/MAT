The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to participate in the scheme and is calculated using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.

They have a vesting period of three years from the first day of the financial year to which they relate and one third of the shares will vest each year for three years.
