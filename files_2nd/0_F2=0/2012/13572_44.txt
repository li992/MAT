23 Contingent liabilities In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide financing support for its customers.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to financing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed on a discounted basis.
As the directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does not represent a value that is expected to crystallise.
However, the amounts are discounted at the Groups borrowing rate to reflect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
The contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not generally adopt cash flow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The discounted values of contingent liabilities relating to delivered aircraft and other arrangements where financing is in place, less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions, were: 2012 2011 m $m m $m Gross contingent liabilities 569 925 612 951 1 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security 70 114 124 192 2 Contingent liabilities net of relevant security reduced by 20% 133 216 201 312 1 Security includes unrestricted cash collateral of: 64 104 67 104 2 Although sensitivity calculations are complex, the reduction of relevant security by 20 per cent illustrates the sensitivity of the contingent liability to changes in this assumption.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant financing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
