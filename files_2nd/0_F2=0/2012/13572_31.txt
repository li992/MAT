Goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: Cash-generating unit CGU or groups of CGUs Primary reporting 2012 2011 segment m m Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Civil aerospace 223 230 Offshore marine arising from the acquisitions of Vinters Limited and Scandinavian Electric Holdings AS Marine 649 645 Offshore marine arising from the acquisition of ODIM ASA Marine 115 112 Other Various 115 112 1,102 1,099 R olls-Royce Holdings plc annual report 2012 96 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 8 Intangible assets continued Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2012 on the following basis: The carrying values of goodwill have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates 2.0 2.5 per cent that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 13 per cent 2011 13 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average costofcapital, adjusted for specific risks.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation.
These are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent 2011 2.5 per cent.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 75 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Vinters Limited Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 80 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Other intangible assets Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and recoverable engine costs have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11 per cent 2011 11 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost ofcapital, adjusted for specific risks.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that are outside the Groups control discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays, could result in impairment in future years.
