Investments in associates continued On 22 November 2012, BP, Rosneft and Rosneftegaz the state-owned parent company of Rosneft signed definitive and binding agreements for the sale of BPs 50% interest in TNK-BP to Rosneft and for BPs investment in Rosneft.
BP and Rosneft announced heads of terms for this transaction on 22 October 2012, after which our investment was classified as an asset held for sale and therefore equity accounting ceased.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Financialriskfactors The group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from natural business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including: market risks relating to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
The group financial risk committee GFRC advises the group chief financial officer CFO who oversees the management of these risks.
The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the group treasurer and the heads of the group finance, tax and the integrated supply and trading functions.
The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group.
The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the group chief executive GCE, and via the GCE to the board, that the groups financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordancewith group policies and group risk appetite.
The groups trading activities in the oil, natural gas and power markets are managed within the integrated supply and trading function, while the activities in the financial markets are managed by the treasury function, working under the compliance and control structure of the integrated supplyand trading function.
All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision.
These teams are subject to close financial and management control.
The integrated supply and trading function maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk associated with trading activity.
A policy and risk committee monitors and validates limits and risk exposures, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologiesand procedures.
A commitments committee approves value-at-risk delegations, the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.
In addition, the integrated supply and trading function undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a separate control framework as described more fully below.
a Marketrisk Market risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business.
The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the groups financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.
The group enters into derivatives in a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation.
In addition, the group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its natural business exposures.
In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.
The group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions using value-at-risk techniques.
These techniques are based on Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a one-day holding period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures and the history of one-day price movements, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing.
The value-at-risk table does not incorporate any of the groups natural business exposures or any derivatives entered into to risk manage those exposures.
Market risk exposure in respect of embedded derivatives is also not included in the value-at-risk table.
Value-at-risk limits are in place for each trading activity and for the groups trading activity in total.
The board has delegated a limit of $100 million value at risk in support of this trading activity.
The high and low values at risk indicated in the table below for each type of activity are independent of each other.
Through the portfolio effect the high value at risk for the group as a whole is lower than the sum of the highs for the constituent parts.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to a 95% confidence interval.
This means that, in statistical terms, one would expect to see a decrease in fair values greater than the trading value at risk on one occasion per month if the portfolio were left unchanged.

i Commoditypricerisk The groups integrated supply and trading function uses conventional financial and commodity instruments and physical cargoes available in the related commodity markets.
Oil and natural gas swaps, options and futures are used to mitigate price risk.
Power trading is undertaken using a combination of over-the-counter forward contracts and other derivative contracts, including options and futures.
This activity is on both a standalone basis and in conjunction with gas derivatives in relation to gas-generated power margin.
In addition, NGLs are traded around certain US inventory locations using over-the-counter forward contracts in conjunction with over-the-counter swaps, options and physical inventories.
Trading value-at-risk information in relation to these activities is shown in the table above.
As described above, the group also carries out risk management of certain natural business exposures using over-the-counter swaps and exchange futures contracts.
Together with certain physical supply contracts that are classified as derivatives, these contracts fall outside the value-at risk framework.
For these derivative contracts the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% increase or decrease in all reference prices would have been $16 million at 31 December 2012 2011 $23 million.
This figure does not include any corresponding economic benefit or disbenefit that would arise from the natural business exposure which would be expected to offset the gain or loss on the over-the-counter swaps and exchange futures contracts mentioned above.
In addition, the group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
The net fair value of these contracts was a liability of $1,112 million at 31 December 2012 2011 liability of $1,417 million.
Key information on the natural gas contracts is given below.
At 31 December 2012 2011 Remaining contract terms 2 years and 5 months to 5 years and 9 months 3 years and 5 months to 6 years and 9 months Contractual notional amount 117 million therms 952 million therms Financial statements 221 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued For these embedded derivatives the sensitivity of the net fair value to an immediate 10% favourable or adverse change in the key assumptions is as follows.

In addition, for the purposes of this analysis, in the above table, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value ofthe embedded derivatives is calculated independently of any change in another assumption.
In reality, changes in one factor may contribute to changes in another, which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
Furthermore, the estimated fair values as disclosed should not be considered indicativeof future earnings on these contracts.
ii  Where the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk techniques as explained above.
This activity is included within oil price trading in the value-at-risk table above.
Since BP has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have significant effects on the groups reported results.
The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions.
For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the groups reported results.
The main underlying economic currency of the groups cash flows is the US dollar.
This is because BPs major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars.
BPs foreign currency exchange management policy is to minimize economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar.
The group co-ordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible, and then dealing with any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.
The group manages these exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $200 million.
At 31 December 2012, the foreign currency value at risk was $71 million 2011 $100 million.
At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit.
The most significant exposures relate to capital expenditure commitments and other UK and European operational requirements, for which a hedging programme is in place and hedge accounting is claimed as outlined in Note 33.
For highly probable forecast capital expenditures the group locks in the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards and futures.
The main exposures are sterling, euro, Norwegian krone, Australian dollar and Korean won and at 31 December 2012 open contracts were in place for $853 million sterling, $104 million euro, $172 million Norwegian krone, $112 million Australian dollar and $153 million Korean won capital expenditures maturing within seven years, with over 68% of the deals maturing within two years 2011 $1,242 million sterling, $158 million euro, $118 million Norwegian krone, $210 million Australian dollar and $230 million Korean won capital expenditures maturing within five years, with over 69% of the deals maturing within two years.
For other UK, European and Australian operational requirements the group uses cylinders and currency forwards to hedge the estimated exposures on a 12-month rolling basis.
At 31 December 2012, the open positions relating to cylinders consisted of receive sterling, pay US dollar, purchased call and sold put options cylinders for $2,886 million 2011 $2,683 million : receive euro, pay US dollar cylinders for $1,636 million 2011 $1,304 million : receive Australian dollar, pay US dollar cylinders for $522 million 2011 $312 million.
In addition, most of the groups borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar.
At 31 December 2012, the total foreign currency net borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $361 million 2011 $371 million.
Of this total, $142 million was denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual operating unit being entirely Canadian dollars 2011 $129 million, being entirely Canadian dollars.
It is estimated that a 10% change in the corresponding exchange rates would result in an exchange gain or loss in the income statement of $14 million 2011 $13 million.
iii Interestraterisk Where the group enters into money market contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using value-at-risk techniques as described above.
BP is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt.
While the group issues debt in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the debt to a floating rate exposure, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt.
The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps and excluding disposal deposits at 31 December 2012 was 65% of total finance debt outstanding 2011 65%.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2012 is 2% 2011 2% and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt is four years 2011 five years.
The groups earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the floating rate element of the groups finance debt.
If the interest rates applicable to floating rate instruments were to have increased by 1% on 1 January 2013, it is estimated that the groups finance costs for 2013 would increase by approximately $311 million 2011 $289 million increase in 2012.
This assumes that the amount and mix of fixed and floating rate debt, including finance leases, remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2012 and that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year.
Where the interest rate applicable to an instrument is reset during a quarter it is assumed that this occurs at the beginning of the quarter and remains unchanged for the rest of the year.
In reality, the fixed floating rate mix will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change continually.
Furthermore, the effect on earnings shown by this analysis does not consider the effect of any other changes in general economic activity that may accompany such an increase in interest rates.

Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued iv Equitypricerisk The group holds equity investments, typically made for strategic purposes, that are classified as non-current available-for-sale financial assetsand are measured initially at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income.
Accumulated fair value changes are recycled to the income statement on disposal, or when the investment is impaired.
No impairment losses have been recognized in the years presented relating to listed non-current available-for-sale investments.
For further information see Note 27.
In addition, at 31 December 2012, the group was a party to certain equity price derivatives described in further detail below.
At 31 December 2012, it is estimated that an increase of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate credit to other comprehensive income of $1,502 million 2011 $87 million credit to other comprehensive income, while a decrease of 10% in quoted equity prices would result in an immediate charge to other comprehensive income of $1,502 million 2011 $87 million charge to other comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2012, 82% 2011 77% of the carrying amount of non-current available-for-sale equity financial assets represented the groups 1.25% stake in Rosneft, thus the groups exposure is concentrated on changes in the share price of this equity in particular.
As described in Note 33, the agreements for the purchase of 5.66% and 9.80% shareholdings in Rosneft are derivative financial instruments, whose fair value is impacted by the Rosneft share price, and are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effective.
b Creditrisk Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss tothe group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables.
The group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO, that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk.
Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business.
On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered.
Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk: the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported: and the timely identification and reporting of any non-approved credit exposures and credit losses.
While each segment of the group is typically responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, the treasury function holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.
The global credit environment remained challenging in 2012, suffering not only from continuing economic and political uncertainties but also from key event risks, causing the group to further heighten awareness, discussion and co-ordination of the material credit risks arising from its activities.
Before trading with a new counterparty can start, its creditworthiness is assessed and a credit rating is allocated that indicates the probability of default, along with a credit exposure limit.
The assessment process takes into account all available qualitative and quantitative information about the counterparty and the group, if any, to which the counterparty belongs.
The counterpartys business activities, financial resources and business risk management processes are taken into account in the assessment, to the extent that this information is publicly available or otherwise disclosed to BP by the counterparty, together with external credit ratings.
Creditworthiness continues to be evaluated after transactions have been initiated and a watchlist of higher-risk counterparties is maintained.
The group does not aim to remove credit risk but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses.
The group attempts to mitigate credit risk by entering into contracts that permit netting and allow for termination of the contract on the occurrence of certain events of default.
Depending on the creditworthiness of the counterparty, the group may require collateral or other credit enhancements such as cash deposits, letters of credit, trade credit insurance, liens, third-party guarantees and other forms of credit mitigation.
Trade receivables and payables, and derivative assets and liabilities, are presented on a net basis where unconditional netting arrangements are in place with counterparties and where there is an intent to settle amounts due on a net basis.
The maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount.
Collateral received and recognized in the balance sheet at the year end was $334 million 2011 $273 million and collateral held off balance sheet was $148 million 2011 $6 million.
As at 31 December 2012, the group had in place other credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $11.5 billion of credit risk 2011 $8.6 billion.
Credit exposure exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2012 were $237 million 2011 $415 million in respect of liabilities of jointly controlled entities and associates and $713 million 2011 $1,430 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
Notwithstanding the processes described above, significant unexpected credit losses can occasionally occur.
Exposure to unexpected losses increases with concentrations of credit risk that exist when a number of counterparties are involved in similar activities or operate in the same industry sectoror geographical area, which may result in their ability to meet contractual obligations being impacted by changes in economic, political or other conditions.
The groups principal customers, suppliers and financial institutions with which it conducts business are located throughout the world.
In addition, these risks are managed by maintaining a group watchlist and aggregating multi-segment exposures to ensure that a material credit risk is not missed.
Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the groups overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.
The reports also include details of the largest counterparties by exposure level and expected loss, and details of counterparties on the group watchlist.
For the contracts comprising derivative financial instruments in an asset position at 31 December 2012, excluding the contracts with Rosneft accounted for as derivatives, it is estimated that over 72% 2011 over 76% of the unmitigated credit exposure is to counterparties of investment grade credit quality.
For cash and cash equivalents, the treasury function dynamically manages bank deposit limits to ensure cash is well-diversified and to reduce concentration risks.
At 31 December 2012, over 98% of the cash and cash equivalents balance was deposited with financial institutions rated at least Aby Standard & Poors and A3 by Moodys.
Direct cash and cash equivalent exposures to Greek, Italian, Irish, Portuguese and Spanish financial institutions totalled less than 0.6% of total cash and cash equivalents.
Financial statements 223 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 26.
Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Trade and other receivables of the group are analysed in the table below.
By comparing the BP credit ratings to the equivalent external credit ratings, it is estimated that approximately 70-80% 2011 approximately 70-80% of the unmitigated trade receivables portfolio exposure is of investment grade credit quality.
Current assets, including trade and other receivables, in Egypt amount to $3.0 billion see page 69, of which over one third relates to trade receivables which are not impaired but are past the original due date.
Management is working with the counterparties to continue to collect these amounts.

The groups liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function.
Unless restricted by local regulations, subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to treasury, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the groups overall net currency positions.
In managing its liquidity risk, the group has access to a wide range of funding at competitive rates through capital markets and banks.
The groups treasury function centrally co-ordinates relationships with banks, borrowing requirements, foreign exchange requirements and cash management.
The group believes it has access to sufficient funding through its own current cash holdings and future cash generation including disposal proceeds, the commercial paper markets and by using undrawn committed borrowing facilities to meet foreseeable liquidity requirements.
The group has in place a European Debt Issuance Programme DIP under which the group may raise up to $20 billion of debt for maturities of one month or longer.
At 31 December 2012, the amount drawn down against the DIP was $14,043 million 2011 $11,582 million.
The group also had in place an unlimited US Shelf Registration throughout 2012 and until 5 February 2013, under which it could raise debt with maturities of one month or longer.
From 5 February 2013 the Well-known Seasoned Issuer WKSI shelf was converted to a non-WKSI shelf with a limit of $30 billion, with no draw down since the conversion.
In addition, the group has an Australian Note Issue Programme of A$5 billion, and as at 31 December 2012 the amount drawn down was A$500 million 2011 nil.
The group had a long-term debt rating of A2 stable outlook assigned by Moodys consistently throughout the year, and a rating of A positive outlook assigned by Standard & Poors since July 2012, strengthened from A stable outlook in force at the start of the year.
During 2012, $10.9 billion of long-term taxable bonds were issued with tenors of three to 10 years.
Flexible commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.
As a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $19.5 billion at 31 December 2012, invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice 2011 $14.1 billion.
At 31 December 2012, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of $6,825 million of standby facilities available to draw and repay until mid-March 2014.
These facilities were renegotiated during 2011 with 23 international banks, and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group also has committed letter of credit LC facilities totalling $6,925 million with a number of banks for a one-year duration, allowing LCs to be issued to a maximum one-year duration.
There were also uncommitted secured LC evergreen facilities in place at 31 December 2012 for $2,160 million, secured against inventories or receivables when utilized.
The amounts shown for finance debt in the table below include future minimum lease payments with respect to finance leases.
