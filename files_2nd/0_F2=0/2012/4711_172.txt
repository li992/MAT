Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, depending on whether an individual plan is in surplus or deficit, as follows: 2012 2011 million million Non-current assets 22 60 Non-current liabilities 1,107 898 1,085 838 The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2012, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 4.5% per year 2011 and 2010 4% in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by including an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
