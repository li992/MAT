John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 85 Financial statements: Notes to the Accounts continued 16.
Financial instruments continued Fair value hierarchy As at 31 December 2012, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.

A separate table has not been prepared analysing the Companys book values and fair values.
The 0.1m difference in book values relates to interest bearing loans and borrowings and is deemed to be short-term in nature.

Financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges Foreign exchange forward contracts At 31 December 2012 the Group held foreign currency forward contracts designed as hedges of transaction exposures arising from non-local currency revenue.
These contracts were in line with the Groups policy to hedge significant forecast transaction exposures for a maximum 18 months forward.
The cash flow hedges of non-local revenue were assessed to be highly effective.
Interest rate swaps The Groups policy is to minimise exposures to interest rate risk by ensuring an appropriate balance of long-term and short-term floating rates.
During 2011 the Group hedged the exposure to interest rate rises by use of interest rate swap agreements, whereby the Group paid a fixed rate of interest and received a variable rate of LIBOR margin on the notional amount.
The 25m interest rate swaps at the start of the year matured in June 2012.
No new swaps were entered into during 2012.
At 31 December 2012, 20.6% 2011: 46.9% of the Groups borrowings were fixed.

Foreign currency net investment hedges The Groups treasury policy is to hedge the exposure of currency denominated assets to foreign exchange risk.
This is primarily achieved using forward contracts denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these hedges are transferred to reserves to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiary undertakings.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts are: Group Company Sterling Equivalent 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 million million million million m m Euro EUR 22.5 15.0 22.5 15.0 18.2 12.5 US dollar USD 36.5 30.5 36.5 30.5 22.5 19.6 Czech koruna CZK 115.0 99.0 115.0 99.0 3.7 3.2 Australian dollar AUD 15.4 10.9 15.4 10.9 9.8 7.2 New Zealand dollar NZD 2.4 1.7 2.4 1.7 1.2 0.9 Swedish krona SEK 29.0 25.5 29.0 25.5 2.7 2.4 Indian rupee INR 960.0 750.0 960.0 750.0 10.8 9.1 South African rand ZAR 65.0 55.0 65.0 55.0 4.7 4.4 2012 2011 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Fair value of foreign currency net investment hedges 0.9 0.5 1.5 0.7 Current 0.9 0.5 1.5 0.7 John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 88 Foreign currency sensitivity For 2012, if the UK pound had weakened strengthened by 10% on currencies which have a material impact on the Group, with all other variables held constant, the effect would have been: 2012 2011 Effect on Effect on Profit Effect on Profit Effect on Before T ax Equity Before Tax Equity Change in rate m m m m US dollar USD 10% 0.3 2.0 0.3 3.2 US dollar USD -10% 0.3 1.6 0.3 2.6 Euro EUR 10% 0.6 1.7 0.8 1.7 Euro EUR -10% 0.7 1.4 0.8 1.4 Australian dollar AUD 10% 0.7 1.2 0.6 1.3 Australian dollar AUD -10% 0.8 1.0 0.7 1.1 Indian rupee INR 10% 0.4 1.2 0.5 1.4 Indian rupee INR -10% 0.5 1.0 0.6 1.1 The Groups exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material.
Capital risk management The Group manages the capital structure in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that it has access to ongoing sources of finance such as the debt capital markets.

Credit risk The Group considers its exposure to credit risk at 31 December to be as follows: 2012 2011 m m Bank deposits 34.0 24.4 Trade receivables 138.7 132.8 172.7 157.
