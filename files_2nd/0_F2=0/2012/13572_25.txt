86 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Revisions to IFRS not applicable in 2012 Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
The following will or may be applicable in the future: Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: the principal change is that the financing on post-retirement benefits is calculated on the net surplus or deficit using an AA corporate bond rate.
This will be effective for 2013.
If it had been effective in 2012, it would have increased the current service cost of defined benefit post-retirement schemes by 9 million, the past service cost by 5 million and reduced the net post-retirement scheme financing cost by 55 million.
The net deficit at 31 December 2012 would have reduced by 100 million.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: the principal potential effect is certain entities currently classified as joint ventures may be classified as joint operations.
This would result in the Groups share of the individual assets and liabilities of these entities being included in the financial statements rather than the equity method accounting adopted under the requirements of IAS 31.
This would not affect the Groups net assets or profit after tax for the period.
The Group has reviewed its joint ventures and has concluded that none of its material joint ventures fall to be classified as joint operations under the requirements of IFRS 11.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes, but is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the financial statements.
If endorsed, this will be effective for 2015.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
2 Segmental analysis The analysis by business segment is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating segments, on the basis of those segments whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Board the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8, as follows: Civil aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of commercial aero engines and aftermarket services.
Defence aerospace development, manufacture, marketing and sales of military aero engines and aftermarket services.
Marine development, manufacture, marketing and sales of marine-power propulsion systems and aftermarket services.
Energy development, manufacture, marketing and sales of power systems for the offshore oil and gas industry and electrical power generation and aftermarket services.
Engine Holding development, manufacture, marketing and sales of diesel engines, aftermarket services and the equity accounted share of Tognum AG.
Technology and Operations discussed in the business review operate on a Group-wide basis across all the above segments.
Following the transfer of Bergen Engines AS to Engine Holding on 2 January 2012, the comparative figures for 2011 have been restated to put them on a consistent basis.
The operating results reviewed by the Board are prepared on an underlying basis, which the Board consider reflects better the economic substance of the Groups trading during the year.
The principles adopted to determine underlying results are: Underlying revenues Where revenues are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, these reflect the achieved exchange rates arising on settled derivative contracts.
Underlying profit before financing Where transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group undertaking, this reflects the transactions at the achieved exchange rates on settled derivative contracts.
In addition, adjustments have been made to exclude one-off past-service credits on post-retirement schemes and the effect of acquisition accounting.
Underlying profit before taxation In addition to those adjustments in underlying profit before financing: Includes amounts realised from settled derivative contracts and revaluation of relevant assets and liabilities to exchange rates forecast to be achieved from future settlement of derivative contracts.
Excludes unrealised amounts arising from revaluations required by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, changes in value of financial RRSP contracts arising from changes in forecast payments, changes in the value of put options on NCI and the net impact of financing costs related to post-retirement scheme benefits.
This analysis also includes a reconciliation of the underlying results to those reported in the consolidated income statement.

2 Unrealised fair value changes to derivative contracts: i include those included in equity accounted joint ventures: and ii exclude those for which the related trading contracts have been cancelled when the fair value changes are recognised immediately in underlying profit.
3 The adjustment eliminates charges recognised as a result of recognising assets in acquired businesses at fair value.
4 In 2010, the UK Government announced changes to the basis of the statutory indexation for pension increases.
As a result, the relevant arrangements have been amended, resulting in a gain in the income statement of 130m in 2011, which was excluded from underlying profit.
5 In 2011, the Group agreed revised post-retirement healthcare arrangements on certain of its overseas schemes.
This resulted in a net gain in the income statement of 34m which was excluded from underlying profit.
The reconciliation of underlying earnings per ordinary share is shown in note 5.
