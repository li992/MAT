32 National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory Accounting Statements 2011 12 Capital structure The principal measure of our balance sheet efficiency is our regulatory asset value RAV gearing ratio.
We monitor the RAV gearing of the Gas Transmission and Gas Distribution businesses.
This is calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of RAV and indicates the level of debt employed to fund the regulated businesses.
It is compared to 60% which is the level of RAV gearing indicated by Ofgem as being appropriate for these businesses.
To calculate RAV gearing we exclude an element of debt that is associated with funding the Gas Metering business, which no longer has a RAV associated with it.
RAV gearing as at 31 March 2012 was 52% compared with 54% as at 31 March 2011.
Our regulatory agreements require that we must maintain an investment grade credit rating.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance.
Further details on credit ratings can be found on the debt investors section of National Grids website.
Actuarial valuation of pensions A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent trustees of National Grids two UK defined benefit plans by professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The last completed full actuarial valuation of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme, to which the majority of our employees belong, was as at 31 March 2010.
This concluded that the pretax funding deficit was 599 million in the defined benefit section on the basis of the funding assumptions.
Employer cash contributions for the ongoing cost of this plan are currently being made at a rate of 32% of pensionable payroll.
National Grid agreed with the Trustees of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme that the deficits should be repaired over 17 years, and that it would deposit additional cash in a restricted account over which the Trustees have a charge and that would be paid to the Trustees in the event of insolvency or loss of licence of the relevant employer.
The money is returned back to National Grid if the scheme moves into surplus.
More information on the actuarial valuations can be found in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
