Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates adjusted EPS which uses the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the Company before the effect of acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying cash earnings.
The Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the consolidated income statement and has further analysed this to show the adjusted EPS for continuing operations.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 11m 2011 4m and those owned by employee share trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 4m shares 2011 6m.
The Group has also disclosed the impact of discontinued operations on the basic, diluted and adjusted EPS.
