The Company has no goodwill.
The Group has recently concluded discussions with the Financial Reporting Councils Conduct Committee FRCCC with regard to certain aspects of its asset impairment testing process.
As a result, the Group has i amended its definition of a cash generating unit so that non-monetary assets are reviewed for impairment at a branch level, rather than at a brand level: ii refined its calculation of the pre-tax discount rate: and iii restated and extended the comparative sensitivity disclosures made below in respect of 2011.
The changes agreed with the FRCCC have not impacted the income statement, balance sheet or cash flow statement for 2011 or 2012: the Directors original assessment that no impairment had occurred to goodwill, other intangible assets or other non-monetary assets remains unchanged.
Further details are given below.
Cash Generating Units The Directors consider that each branch in the Group is an individual Cash Generating Unit CGU.
Goodwill and intangible assets have been allocated and monitored for impairment testing purposes to groups of individual CGUs within the same brand.
The following analyses goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives by CGU grouping.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill and other non-monetary assets are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and like-for-like market volume changes which impact sales and therefore cash flow projections.
Management estimates pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU groupings that are not reflected in the cash flow projections.
At the beginning and end of the financial period the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets in all segments was in excess of their book value.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred.
The key variables applied to the value in use calculations were: 8Vh] [adl [dgZXVhih!

This is viewed as the key operating assumption because the state of the building materials market determines the directors approach to margin and cost maintenance: 6 g h` VY jhiZY egZ iVm Y hXdjci gViZ h XVaXjaViZY Wn gZ[ZgZcXZ id i]Z lZ ]iZY VkZgV Z Xdhi d[ XVe iVa L688 d[ i]Z gdje# :dg '%&'!

That is because each CGU operates in the same market, selling the same product types to the same end users and so the risk profiles are not dissimilar: :dg '%&'!

The directors believe this is the most appropriate indicator of long-term growth rates that is available 2011 growth rate : 2.5%.
Sensitivity of results to changes in assumptions Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions were changed significantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: 8]Vc Zh id i]Z lVn i]Z VhhZih VgZ jhZY dg X]Vc Zh id i]Z higViZ n [dg i]Z Wjh cZhh0 6 [jgi]Zg YZiZg dgVi dc c i]Z J@ ZXdcdbn# The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows.
For most of the CGU groupings, given the prudence already built into the Groups five-year plans and the level of headroom they show, the Directors do not envisage reasonably possible changes to the key operating assumptions that are sufficient to generate a different outcome to the impairment calculations undertaken.
However for the CGU groupings listed in the table below this is not the case as the Directors consider that reasonably possible changes in key assumptions could result in discounted future cash flows being insufficient to allow full recovery of the carrying value of the CGUs goodwill and other intangible assets.
The Directors have conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the specific value for each assumption, all other assumptions remaining the same, that would result in the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets equalling their recoverable amounts and these are shown in the tables below.

To show a meaningful comparison to the 2012 impairment sensitivity table, the 2011 discount rate was recalculated using the same methodology, which resulted in an increase from 6.9% to 8.6%.
Had this change been made in 2011, the Directors conclusion that there was no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 31 December 2011 would not have changed.
