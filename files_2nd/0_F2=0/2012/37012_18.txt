The valuations conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Standards 8th Edition and with IVS 1 of International Valuation Standards, and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties, vacancies, letting periods and likely incentives offered to tenants.

The Company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the due and punctual performance by the Issuer of all of its obligations including payments in respect of the Bonds and the obligations of the Company, as Guarantor, constitute direct, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Company.
Subject to certain conditions, the Bonds are convertible into preference shares of the Issuer which are automatically transferred to the Company in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company or at the Companys election any combination of ordinary shares and cash.
The Bonds can be th converted at any time from 14 November 2012 up to the 20 dealing day before the maturity date.
The initial exchange price was 4.3752 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of approximately 22,856 ordinary shares for every 100,000 nominal of the Bonds.
Under the terms of the Bonds, the exchange price is adjusted on the happening of certain events including the payment of dividends by the Company.
Accordingly, following the declaration of the Companys 2012 interim dividend of 5.0 pence per ordinary share, the exchange price was adjusted to 4.3098 per ordinary share with effect from 17 October 2012.
There were no further adjustments to the exchange price in the year and so at 31 December 2012 the exchange price was 4.3098 per ordinary share.
The 2.5 per cent bonds may be redeemed at par at the Companys option subject to the Companys ordinary share price having traded at 30 per cent above the conversion price for a specified period, or at any time once 85 per cent by nominal value of the Bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
If not previously converted, redeemed or purchased and cancelled, the 2.5 per cent bonds will be redeemed at par on 4 October 2018.
A total of 300.0 million nominal of the Bonds were issued and remain outstanding at 31 December 2012.
The Bonds are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and so are presented on the balance sheet at fair value with all gains and losses taken to the income statement through the changes in fair value of financial instruments line.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the Bonds was 311.0 million, with the change in fair value presented in note 14.
The Bonds are listed on the Professional Securities Market.
During the year interest of 1.8 million in respect of the coupon rate has been recognised on the Bonds within finance costs.
3.75 per cent convertible bonds the 3.75 per cent bonds On 28 January 2011 the Company issued 127.6 million, 3.75 per cent perpetual subordinated convertible bonds as part of the consideration for the acquisition of The Trafford Centre note 41.
As a condition of the acquisition the Company also issued to the Peel Group 26.7 million of convertible bonds for a subscription amount of 23.7 million and an implied issue price of the underlying shares of 3.55 per share.
A total of 154.3 million of the 3.75 per cent bonds were issued and remain outstanding at 31 December 2012 2011 154.3 million.
These are accounted for as equity at their fair value on issue which totalled 143.7 million 2011 143.7 million.
The 3.75 per cent bonds can be converted at the option of the bondholder at any time from 28 January 2013 at 4.00 per ordinary share, a conversion rate of 250 ordinary shares for every 1,000 nominal.
Full conversion would result in 38,579,250 ordinary shares being issued.
The 3.75 per cent bonds may be redeemed at their principal amount at the Companys option on 28 January 2014 or any subsequent interest payment date thereafter, or at any time once 85 per cent or more of the principal amount of the bonds originally issued have been converted or cancelled.
During the year interest of 5.8 million 2011 5.3 million has been recognised on these bonds directly in equity.
34 Operating leases The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the UK the standard shopping centre lease is for a term of 10 to 15 years.
Standard lease provisions include service charge payments, recovery of other direct costs and review every five years to market rent.
Standard turnover based leases have a turnover percentage agreed with each lessee which is applied to a retail units annual sales and any excess between the resulting turnover rent and the minimum rent is receivable by the Group.
The future minimum lease amounts receivable under non-cancellable operating leases for continuing operations are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Not later than one year 413.5 421.6 Later than one year and not later than five years 1,326.8 1,342.6 Later than five years 1,649.0 1,344.5 3,389.3 3,108.7 The income statement includes 0.7 million 2011 1.0 million recognised in respect of expected increased rent resulting from outstanding reviews where the actual rent will only be determined on settlement of the rent review.
120 Intu Properties plc 2012 Annual Report Overview Business model Business review Financial review Corporate Governance Accounts Other information and strategy responsibility 35 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 44 to 49.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2012 2012 2011 2011 m m m m Borrowings 1,289.4 2,556.4 980.6 2,630.9 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 2,440.4 2,440.4 2,476.7 2,476.7 Net borrowings profile 3,729.8 116.0 3,457.3 154.2 Interest rate protection on floating debt 95.5% 94.1% Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 3.95 per cent 2011 4.43 per cent.
Unallocated and forward starting swaps are excluded from the above calculation.
The nominal value of those swaps is 615.0 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 101.9 million 2011 93.6 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 108.3 million 2011 102.7 million in the fair value of derivatives.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are dealt with in the income statement.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Where the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
Details of interest rate swap contracts in place as at 31 December 2012 are included in the Financial review on page 49, which shows the interest cost to the Group will be subject to in the future regardless of changes in market interest rates for the nominal amount of debt in the contract.
b Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
It was previously Group policy to eliminate partially the foreign exchange risk through hedging instruments and foreign currency denominated borrowings.
The Group no longer has operating subsidiaries located overseas with investments now being through associates and available for sale investments.
As existing swaps matured the decision was taken not to renew these.
As at 31 December 2012 no foreign exchange hedging arrangements were in place.
The table summarises the Group exposure to foreign currency risk arising from the Groups investments at 31 December 2012: Group Group Group Group 2012 2011 2012 2011 INRm INRm US$m US$m Net assets 3,815.4 2,905.7 238.6 261.8 Derivative impact nominal forward foreign exchange swaps 140.0 Net exposure 3,815.4 2,905.7 238.6 121.8 There was no ineffectiveness arising as a result of these hedges in either year.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent appreciation in foreign exchange rates would be positive movement of 21.1 million 2011 22.6 million on Group reserves.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent depreciation in foreign exchange rates would be a negative movement of 17.2 million 2011 17.2 million 2011 18.5 million on Group reserves.
Intu Properties plc 2012 Annual Report 121 Accounts continued Notes to the accounts continued 35 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 31.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years.
As at 31 December 2012, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of six years 2011 seven years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by using a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by re-borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The Group may choose to pre-fund significant capital expenditure by arranging facilities or raising debt in the capital markets and then placing surplus funds on deposit until required for the project.
Efficient treasury management and strict credit control minimise the costs and risk associated with this policy which ensures that funds are available to meet commitments as they fall due.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal including notional principal in the case of gross settled foreign exchange contracts.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits, loans and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, aiming wherever possible to identify and address risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2012 is 2.7 million 2011 3.1 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2012 2011 m m Up to three months 15.9 17.8 Three to six months 0.9 1.4 Trade receivables 16.8 19.2 At 31 December 2012 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling 6.8 million 2011 4.8 million.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

The fair value of net liabilities acquired was 0.6 million resulting in goodwill of 4.0 million being recognised on the acquisition.
On 24 December 2012 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Capital & Regional Braehead Limited renamed Intu Braehead Limited, which holds a 50 per cent interest in the Xscape Braehead Partnership for consideration of 4.0 million.
As a result of this transaction, the Groups interest in the Xscape Braehead Partnership is now 100 per cent.
Assets with a fair value of 30.3 million and liabilities with a fair value of 24.0 million were acquired with the difference from the consideration being included in the income statement.
Acquisitions during 2011 Acquisition of The Trafford Centre On 28 January 2011 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Tokenhouse Holdings Limited renamed CSC Trafford Centre Group Limited for consideration consisting of 155.0 million ordinary shares in the Company and 127.6 million, 3.75 per cent perpetual subordinated convertible bonds the convertible bonds.
As a condition of the acquisition the Company also issued to the Peel Group 12,316,817 ordinary shares for 3.55 each and convertible bonds with a nominal value of 26.7 million convertible into 6,679,250 ordinary shares, for a subscription amount of 23.7 million and an implied issue price of the underlying shares of 3.55 each.
Total exceptional administration expenses associated with the acquisition and integration were 21.6 million.
Through its subsidiaries CSC Trafford Centre Group Limited owns and operates The Trafford Centre in Manchester.
The fair value of the consideration paid was assessed as 702.7 million, consisting of 582.8 million in respect of the ordinary shares and 119.9 million in respect of the convertible bonds.
The fair value was assessed using the Intu Properties plc opening share price on 28 January 2011 of 3.76, being the share price at the point the acquisition took place.
The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is set out in the table below.
Fair value adjustment Book value Fair value m m m Assets Investment and development property 1,653.6 3.6 1,650.0 Plant and equipment 0.4 0.4 Cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash of 3.6 million 41.2 41.2 Trade and other receivables 18.8 12.9 5.9 Total assets 1,714.0 16.5 1,697.5 Liabilities Borrowings 833.3 16.6 849.9 Trade and other payables 90.1 15.6 74.5 Derivative financial instruments 17.5 17.5 Total liabilities 940.9 1.0 941.9 Net assets 773.1 17.5 755.6 Fair value of consideration paid 702.7 Gain on acquisition of subsidiaries 52.9 The book values disclosed are under IFRS and after allowing for the impact of joining the REIT regime.
The trade and other liabilities book value includes the REIT entry charge of 33.0 million.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration and as a result a gain of 52.9 million is recognised in the income statement on acquisition.
This gain reflects the Intu share price at the date of the acquisition of 3.76 which, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, is required to be used to assess the fair value of the consideration for acquisition accounting purposes.
The acquisition was however agreed based on an issue price of the Intu ordinary shares of 4.00.
The difference between the agreed issue price of 4.00 and the share price at the date the acquisition was completed of 3.76 is the principal reason for recording an accounting gain on the acquisition.
Amounts disclosed have been adjusted from those reported in the Groups interim financial statements to reflect the finalisation of the review of the acquired net assets and liabilities.
This has resulted in an increase of 1.4 million in the trade and other payables recognised with a resulting reduction in the gain in the income statement.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 the acquired companies contributed 80.5 million to the revenue of the Group and 25.4 million to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The acquisition of The Trafford Centre contributed 29.6 million to the underlying earnings of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 including the deduction of 5.3 million in relation to interest on the convertible bonds which is deducted directly in equity.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2011 the revenue of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have been 524.1 million and the profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have been 36.3 million.

The final consideration was subsequently adjusted for the agreed net assets value of the business at 1 December 2011 which is expected to result in a reduction to the purchase price of 2.1 million.
The fair value of the consideration was therefore assessed as 70.7 million.
The Broadmarsh Retail Limited Partnership owns and manages the Broadmarsh shopping centre, Nottingham.

This goodwill represents future cash flows which the Group expects to receive as a result of the acquisition.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 the acquired business contributed 0.3 million to the revenue of the Group and 0.1 million to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2011 the revenue of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have been 521.2 million and the profit for the year would have been 53.0 million.
In 2012 the fair value of consideration was reassessed, reducing goodwill to 8.8 million.
Due to a reduction in the 2012 year end property valuation, the remaining goodwill has been impaired.
42 Sale of subsidiaries Disposal of C&C US in 2011 In 2010 the Group entered into an agreement with Equity One, pursuant to which Equity One agreed to acquire the Groups interests in its US subsidiaries C&C US, through a venture with Intu.
The transaction was completed on 4 January 2011.
Consideration consisted of 11.35 million units in the venture and 4.05 million shares in Equity One common stock.
Based on the Equity One share price on 4 January of $18.15 and an exchange rate on that day of 1.56, the consideration had a fair value of 179.3 million at the date of the transaction and the net assets exchanged had a book value of 147.3 million including a deferred tax liability on investment property of 47.7 million.
After taking into account costs of the transaction of 2.5 million, and the transfer of related hedging and foreign currency balances from equity of 10.9 million, a profit of 40.4 million was recognised in the income statement as summarised in the table below.

49 Share-based payment The Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements providing employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled, and as such the expense recognised in the income statement is assessed based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded as determined at their grant date.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Intu Properties plc Approved Share Option Scheme and the Intu Properties plc Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Exercise is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
The performance condition for options granted up to 2011 requires Intu Group smoothed earnings to grow over a three year period commencing with the year of grant at a rate in excess of 5 per cent per annum compound.
smoothed earnings growth means the percentage increase in underlying earnings per share, adjusted by a excluding exceptional and valuation items and b limiting trading or non-recurring items to 10 per cent of profit before tax.
For the award made in 2009 exceptionally, the base figure for comparison purposes is the smoothed earnings achieved in 2009 for comparison with the three year period commencing with 2010.
Options granted to members of the Executive Committee in 2012 are subject to a sliding scale performance condition based on EPS growth of between 46 per cent per annum over a three year period.
Options granted to staff who are not members of the Executive Committee 2012 are not subject to a performance condition.
Except in the case of a good leaver, options may not be exercised within three years of grant and before satisfaction or waiver of any applicable performance condition, and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options become capable of exercise.
The options automatically lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
In 2012, individuals who received awards of unapproved options in 2011 and 2012 were given the option to exchange their awards for jointly owned shares under the JSOP.
As required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the fair value of the award is measured immediately before the modification and immediately after and any increase in fair value must be recognised as an expense through the income statement over the performance period.
Under this test an additional 0.1 million will be charged over the remaining vesting period.
