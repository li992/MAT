BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued for the year ended 31 December 2012 15 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued d Interest Rate Risk The prices of securities tend to be sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.
Unexpected fluctuations in interest rates could cause the corresponding prices of long positions and short positions adopted to move in directions which were not originally anticipated.
In addition, interest rate increases generally increase the interest or carrying costs of investments.
However, the Companys investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss are non interest bearing, and therefore are not exposed to interest rate risk.
The Companys own cash balances are not materially exposed to interest rate risk as cash and cash equivalents are held on floating interest rate deposits with banks and the Company does not rely on income from bank interest to meet day to day expenses.
e Leverage by Underlying Funds Certain Underlying Funds in which the Company may have an economic interest operate with a substantial degree of leverage and are not limited in the extent to which they either may borrow or engage in margin transactions.
The positions maintained by such Underlying Funds may in aggregate value be in excess of the net asset value of AllBlue and AllBlue Leveraged.
This leverage presents the potential for a higher rate of total return but will also increase the volatility of AllBlue, AllBlue Leveraged and, as a consequence, the Company, including the risk of a total loss of the amount invested.
f Leverage by AllBlue Leveraged AllBlue Leverage operates with a substantial degree of leverage for the purposes of making investments and is not limited in the extent to which they either may borrow or engage in margin transactions although is expected to be an amount equal to approximately 50 per cent.
This leverage presents the potential for a greater rate of total return but will also increase exposure to capital risk and interest costs.
g Capital management The investment objective of the Company is to provide Shareholders with consistent long-term capital growth through an investment policy of investing substantially all of its assets in AllBlue or any successor vehicle to AllBlue.
As the Companys Ordinary Shares are traded on the LSE, the Ordinary Shares may trade at a discount to their net asset value per Share.
However, in structuring the Company, the Directors have given detailed consideration to the discount risk and how this may be managed.
