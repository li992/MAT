Policy The remuneration policy adopted by the Board is designed to ensure that the Directors interests are allied to the long-term growth of the Group and therefore to the interests of the shareholders as a whole.
The Group does not operate any form of bonus scheme or share option scheme since the executive Directors salaries for the year are determined by the Board once the results for the year are known, with any salary increase calculated and paid with effect from the beginning of the financial year.
Remuneration of non-executive Directors The fees of the non-executive Directors are reviewed periodically by the executive Directors who make recommendations to the Board.
The current level of 20,000 has been fixed for a number of years.
Service contracts No Director has a service contract.
