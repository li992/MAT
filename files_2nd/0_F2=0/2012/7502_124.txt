FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Year ended 31 March 2012 20.
OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 2012 2011 m m Amounts receivable for the provision of services 203.7 165.6 Other receivables 67.1 61.2 Loans to joint ventures 0.9 Prepayments and accrued income 20.3 19.8 291.1 247.5 TRADE RECEIVABLES The Group has provided fully for those receivable balances that it does not expect to recover.
This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers that represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 5.3m 2011: 6.8m which are past due at the reporting date but for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 35 days 2011: 38 days.
Trade debtors to be received from customers relating to instalments of policy premiums that are not yet due have been excluded from the average age calculation.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2012 2011 m m 130 days 3160 days 0.2 0.1 6190 days 0.2 0.2 91 days 1.6 1.0 2.0 1.3 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
OTHER RECEIVABLES As part of its activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
CASH BALANCES AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash balances and cash equivalents of 52.8m 2011: 16.1m comprise cash held by the Group and shortterm bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
