Financial Statements 2012 HERITAGE OIL PLC 27 6 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS CONTINUED In May 2011, HOGL commenced international arbitration proceedings in London against the Ugandan government in accordance with provisions of the PSAs.
HOGL is seeking a decision requiring, among other things, the return or release of approximately $405 million, plus interest, in aggregate currently on deposit with the URA or in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London.
HOGL made a number of claims in the arbitration proceedings that tax had been improperly imposed on it which the arbitration tribunal ruledon 3April 2013 to be outside its jurisdiction.
The tribunal ruled at the same time that there were two areas of HOGLs claims which it will consider, in respect of contractual stabilisation clause protection and breach of other contractual obligations.
Accordingly, the arbitration proceedings now concern HOGLs claims that the Ugandan government wrongfully or unreasonablydelayed consent to the sale by HOGL of the rights under the PSAs and that the Ugandan government should indemnify HOGL with respect to any tax liability which arose due to changes in lawthat materially reduced the economic benets to be derived by HOGL from the PSAs.
The determination by the arbitral tribunal marks the endof the preliminary phase.
The proceedings will now continueon to deal with the merits phase of Heritages contractual claims against the Ugandan government and the underlying substantive Ugandan tax matters remain under appeal in the Ugandan courts.
On 15 April 2011, Heritage and its wholly owned subsidiary HOGL, received Particulars of Claim led in the High Court of Justice in England by Tullow seeking $313,447,500 for alleged breach of contract as a result of HOGLs and Heritages refusal to reimburse Tullow in relation to a payment made by Tullow of $313,447,500 on 7 April 2011 to the URA.
Heritage and HOGL have led their Defence and Counterclaim against Tullow seeking instead the release to HOGL of the $283,447,000 plus interest currently being held in escrow with Standard Chartered Bank in London.
The case commenced to be heard in the High Court in March 2013 and a first instance decision is expected to be received later this year.
Heritage and HOGL believe that the claim has nomerit and are in the process of vigorously and robustly defending it.
Although disputes of this nature are inherently uncertain, the Directors believe that the monies on deposit and held in escrow will ultimately be recovered by Heritage.
The results of the Ugandan operations have been classied as discontinued operations.
