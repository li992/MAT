Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Shareholder information Renishaw plc Annual report and accounts 2012 22.
Financial instruments The Group has exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk arising from its use of financial instruments.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to these risks, along with the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing the risks.
Credit risk The Group carries a credit risk, being the risk of non-payment of trade receivables by its customers.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all new customers before credit is given above certain thresholds.
There is a spread of risks among a large number of customers with no significant concentration with one customer or in any one geographical area.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
An analysis by currency of Group financial assets at the year end is as follows: Trade receivables Other receivables Cash 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Currency 000 000 000 000 000 000 Pound Sterling 7,374 7,455 7,493 7,272 7,512 8,343 US Dollar 35,908 22,771 327 268 2,744 1,357 Japanese Yen 8,142 7,922 1,548 438 2,337 3,152 Euro 17,852 17,558 6,397 1,202 866 2,688 Other 14,131 5,827 1,514 847 7,668 8,193 83,407 61,533 17,279 10,027 21,127 23,733 The above trade receivables, other receivables and cash are predominately held in the functional currency of the relevant entity, with the exception of 2,500,000 of Euro-denominated trade receivables being held in the parent company, along with some foreign currency cash balances which are of a short-term nature.
The ageing of trade receivables past due, but not impaired, at the end of the year was: 2012 2011 000 000 Past due 01 month 14,654 12,487 Past due 12 months 5,808 3,390 Past due more than 2 months 1,219 1,179 Balance at the end of the year 21,681 17,056 Movements in the provision for impairment of trade receivables during the year were: 2012 2011 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 4,007 3,989 Changes in amounts provided 40 479 Amounts utilised 218 461 Balance at the end of the year 3,829 4,007 Liquidity risk The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is cash generative and uses monthly cash ow forecasts to monitor cash requirements.
In respect of net cash, the carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are oating and based on LIBOR LIBID, which can change over time, affecting the Groups interest income.
An increase of 1% in interest rates would result in an increase in interest income of approximately 250,000.
The market value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to market data.

The contracted cash ows for the financial liabilities are the same as the carrying values.
There is no significant difference between the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities and their carrying value in the Consolidated balance sheet.
Under the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7, all fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities are considered to be categorised as Level 2, except for the deferred consideration, which is categorised as Level 3.
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost, apart from the forward exchange contracts, which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated income statement unless subject to hedge accounting.
Market risk As noted in the Business review under Principal risks and uncertainties, the Group operates in a number of foreign currencies with the majority of sales being made in these currencies but with a concentration of manufacturing in the UK, Ireland and India.
Exchange rates and sensitivity analysis The Group has hedged a significant proportion of its forecasted US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro cash ows and hence there is not expected to be a material impact on the Groups results resulting from uctuations in their exchange rates against Sterling.
The following are the exchange rates which have been applicable during the financial year.
Also noted is the increase in profit that a one US Dollar cent change, a one Japanese Yen change and a one Euro cent change in exchange rate, where the foreign currency is strengthening against Sterling, might have on the Groups results.
The method of estimation involves assessing the impact of this currency on the Groups transactions assuming all other variables are unchanged.
2012 2011 Increase in group profit for one cent or Year end Average Year end Average one yen exchange exchange exchange exchange movement Currency rate rate rate rate 000 US Dollar 1.57 1.59 1.61 1.60 450 Japanese Yen 125 125 129 132 70 Euro 1.25 1.19 1.11 1.16 60 Average US Dollar forward contract rates 1.58 1.45 Average Japanese Yen forward contract rates 135 139 Average Euro forward contract rates 1.22 1.30 The Company has US Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro forward contracts which mature after the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these contracts at the year end resulted in a profit carried forward of 2,526,000 2011 loss 4,115,000 see note 21.
The nominal amounts of foreign currencies relating to these forward contracts are, in Sterling terms, 218,814,000 in US Dollars 2011 44,195,000, 70,581,000 in Japanese Yen 2011 28,890,000 and 103,573,000 in Euro 2011 116,024,000.
