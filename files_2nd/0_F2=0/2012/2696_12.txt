44 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Section 1 Basis of preparation 1.1 General information Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group or the Group form an international telecommunications group providing critical communications infrastructure and services for large users of telecommunications worldwide.
1.2 Summary of significant accounting policies The following accounting policies relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2012.
These consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments held at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances.
They form the basis of judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on a continuing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Critical judgements and areas where the use of estimates is significant are discussed in note 1.3.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group entities.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Directors report on pages 2 to 5.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and net debt are described in the Directors report on pages 6 to 9 and its liquidity management in note 4.4 to these financial statements.
The Groups forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading performance, indicate that the Group is able to operate within the level of its current available facilities.
A formal process for monitoring compliance with debt covenants is also in place.
Further information on debt, including details of the successful early replacement of the revolving credit facility with a new 260 million facility, available until June 2015, can be found in section 4.
In addition, the payment of 100 million to the Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan pension scheme under a new deficit funding agreement removed the requirement to ring fence 125 million of financial resources for the benefit of the pension scheme, as detailed in note 3.5.
After reviewing budgets and other longer-term plans and making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Entities controlled by the parent of the Group are deemed to be subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively takes control until the date that control ceases.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries are aligned with the policies adopted by the Group to ensure consistency.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity.
The total comprehensive income of non-wholly owned subsidiaries is attributed to owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which the Group operates is the UK.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore presented in pounds sterling.
Amounts included in the consolidated financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiaries are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates the functional currency.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 45 Where Group companies transact in foreign currencies, these transactions are translated into the companys functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities measured at historical cost are translated into the companys functional currency at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
The results, assets and liabilities of Group companies outside of the UK, that have a functional currency different to pounds sterling, are translated into pounds sterling as follows: i assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date: ii revenue and expenses are translated at rates closely approximating the rate at the date of the transactions, which in practice may be the average rate for the period.
Resulting exchange differences are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve within equity and the Statement of other comprehensive income.
Financial instruments Classification The Group classifies its financial assets into the following categories: receivables, cash and cash equivalents, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Group does not currently have any assets classified as fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, or held-to-maturity investments.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through profit or loss.
Borrowings and trade and other payables are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Details on the accounting policies for the measurement of the above instruments are set out in the relevant notes.
Recognition and derecognition The Group recognises a financial asset or liability when it becomes a party to the contract.
Financial instruments are derecognised in the statement of financial position when the contractual cash flows expire or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Current non-current distinction Current assets include assets held primarily for trading purposes, cash and cash equivalents and assets expected or intended to be realised or used in one year or less.
All other assets are classified as non-current assets.
Current liabilities include liabilities held primarily for trading purposes and liabilities expected to be settled within one year or less or in the course of the Groups operating cycle if longer.
All other liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities.
Application of recently issued International Financial Reporting Standards The Group considered the implications, if any, of the following amendments to IFRS during the year ended 31 March 2012.
New and amended Standards and Interpretations endorsed by the European Union and adopted by the Group in 2011 12.
The standards or interpretations which came into effect for the current reporting period did not have a material impact on the net assets or results of the Group.
New and amended Standards and Interpretations not adopted early by the Group IAS 19 Revised Employee Benefits will become effective for the Group in the 2013 14 financial year.
Under IAS 19 Revised the interest charge on retirement benefit liabilities and the expected return on pension plan assets will be replaced by a net interest expense on the net defined benefit liabilities based on high quality corporate bond rates.
This amendment is expected to increase our reported net pension cost charged to the income statement, but will have no material impact on the net assets of the Group.
Other standards and interpretations issued, but not yet effective, are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups net assets or results.
1.3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, a number of estimates and assumptions have been made relating to the reporting of results of operations and the financial position of the Group.
Results may differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.
The Groups most critical accounting estimates and judgements, which are those considered by the Directors to be the most important to the presentation of its consolidated financial position and results, are set out below and in more detail in the related notes.
These particular policies require subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are uncertain.
i Revenue recognition note 2.1 ii Depreciation of property, plant and equipment note 3.2 iii Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets notes 3.2 and 3.3 iv Receivables allowances note 3.1 v Recognition of deferred tax assets note 2.3 vi Provisions note 3.4 vii Defined benefit pension schemes note 3.5 46 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Section 2 Results for the year This section analyses the Groups result before tax by reference to income generated by the Groups business and key operating costs.
2.1 Result before tax Accounting policies Revenue recognition Revenue, which excludes discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes, represents the amount receivable in respect of the sale of equipment or services provided to our customers.
It does not include sales between Group companies.
Establishing the appropriate amount and timing of revenue recognised requires judgement.
Revenue from product categories IP and data, hosting and applications and traditional voice presented below is derived from sales of transmission of content on our network, services and equipment in accordance with the following policies.
Provision of services Revenue from services is recognised as the services are provided.
In respect of services invoiced in advance, amounts are deferred until provision of the service.
Revenue arising from the provision of other services such as maintenance contracts, is recognised evenly over the periods in which theservice is provided.
Interconnection and transmission of content Amounts payable to and due from other telecommunications operators are recognised as the services are provided.
Charges are negotiated separately and are subject to continual review.
Revenue generated through the provision of these services is accounted for gross of any amounts payable to other telecommunications operators for interconnect fees, unless acting as an agent, in which case revenue represents the net fee earned.
In certain instances estimates are used to determine the amount of revenue receivable from or expense payable to these other operators.
The prices at which these services are charged are sometimes regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment.
Estimates, based on historical trends and experience, are used in assessing the likely impact of these adjustments.
Adjustments to interconnect estimates are taken to operating profit in the period in which the adjustments are made.
The Group earns revenue from the transmission of content and traffic on its network originated by third party providers.
The Group assesses whether revenue should be recorded gross as principal or net as agent based on features such as whether the Group has latitude for establishing the selling price, provision of customer remedies, whether the Group has primary responsibility for providing the services and assumption of credit risk.
Sale of equipment Revenue from sales of telecommunication equipment is recognised upon delivery to, and acceptance by, the customer as this is when the transfer of both significant risks and rewards of ownership and control is deemed to occur.
Multiple element contracts The total consideration on arrangements with multiple revenue generating activities generally the sale of telecommunications equipment and continuingservices is allocated to those components that are capable of operating independently based on the estimated fair value the usual selling price where the products or services are routinely provided on a standalone basis of the components.
When the fair value of components cannot be assessed the revenue is spread over the term of the service.
Reportable segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosures in respect of the operating segments of the Group according to the management approach.
This approach reflects the type and extent of information presented to the chief operating decision-maker CODM of the Group the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group Board.
The Board considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the Group and making decisions about the allocation of resources, as the network infrastructure is utilised across all business lines.
Accordingly, the Group discloses a single reportable operating segment.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 47 2.1.
1 Segmental information The results from continuing operations, in the format as provided to the Board for the years ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011 are presented below: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Revenue 2,149 2,257 Cost of sales 1,129 1,192 Gross margin 1,020 1,065 Pre-exceptional operating costs 642 623 EBITDA 378 442 LTIP credit 9 Depreciation and amortisation 269 285 Net other operating expense income 9 4 Group operating profit before exceptional operating costs 100 170 Exceptional operating costs see note 2.2 478 17 Total operating loss profit 378 153 Non-operating exceptional items see notes 2.2 18 14 Net finance expense 32 27 Loss profit before income tax 392 140 Income tax charge credit see note 2.3 149 69 Loss profit for the year 541 209 There are no differences between the segmental information set out above and the Groups results.
The additions to non-current assets during the year excluding financial assets, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets were 266 million 2010 11: 286 million.
EBITDA EBITDA is a key profit indicator, reflecting the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group.
It is not a measure defined by IFRS.
It is based on management reporting and is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP charge credit, net other operating income expense and exceptional items.
A reconciliation from total operating loss profit to EBITDA is as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Total operating loss profit 378 153 Pre-exceptional depreciation and amortisation 269 285 LTIP credit 9 Net other operating expense income 9 4 Operating exceptional items 478 17 EBITDA 378 442 Additional information The Group provides services to customers through several market channels.
Below is a summary of revenue and gross margin by those market channels.
Gross margin includes revenue and those costs directly attributable to specific revenue streams or customers.
The gross margin does not include the costs of running and maintaining the network, including depreciation, which is the primary asset used across all market channels.
Investment in the Groups network is not considered by the CODM based upon market channel or product.
Further, the management, legal and operating structure of the Group wasnot organised around these market channels during the year.
These analyses were not used by the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group Board to allocate resources across the Group during the year as a large proportion of the expenses of the Group are not customer specific.
Accordingly, the Directors believe these market channels are not operating segments for the purposes of IFRS 8.
The analysis of revenue and gross margin by market channel is presented below as additional, non-GAAP information: UK UK public UK enterprise sector Global mid-market UK carrier Total Year ended 31 March 2012 m m m m m m Revenue 822 305 562 187 273 2,149 Cost of sales 419 110 326 97 177 1,129 Gross margin 403 195 236 90 96 1,020 UK public UK UK enterprise sector Global mid-market UK carrier Total Year ended 31 March 2011 m m m m m m Revenue 849 285 557 212 354 2,257 Cost of sales 403 115 319 114 241 1,192 Gross margin 446 170 238 98 113 1,065 48 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Group-wide information The information on products and services, non-current assets and major customers across the Group required by IFRS 8 is presented below.
Non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets can be classified by country, based on the country of incorporation of the Group undertaking holding those assets, as follows: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m United Kingdom 1,398 1,845 All other countries 65 81 Total 1,463 1,926 The revenue from external customers can be analysed by product as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Traditional voice including legacy products 874 995 Data and IP 981 999 Hosting and applications 294 263 Total 2,149 2,257 Revenue by country can be classified as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m United Kingdom 1,959 2,067 All other countries 190 190 Total 2,149 2,257 Revenue is allocated to a country based on the location of the customer contract.
It does not follow necessarily that the international telecommunications traffic transiting the Groups networks originates in that location.
The Group does not have access to information onthe original source or ultimate destination of international telecommunications traffic.
The Group does not have any individual customers from which revenue exceeds 10% of Group revenue.
2 Operating costs An analysis of the operating costs incurred by the Group, classified by the nature of the cost, is presented below: 2011 12 2010 11 PrePreexceptional Exceptional Total exceptional Exceptional Total m m m m m m Outpayments and direct costs 1,129 1,129 1,192 1,192 Employee and other staff expenses 306 306 294 6 300 Operating lease rentals networks 56 56 65 65 property 54 54 49 4 53 Other administrative expenses 68 68 61 2 63 Network costs 112 112 101 5 106 Energy and other property costs 46 46 44 44 Operating costs before depreciation and amortisation 1,771 1,771 1,806 17 1,823 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 228 42 270 242 242 Amortisation of intangible assets 41 436 477 43 43 Operating costs 2,040 478 2,518 2,091 17 2,108 Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 49 2.1.

5 Other operating expense In 2011 12 other operating expense of 11 million principally comprised the impact of change in discount rate applied to provisions for onerous property leases and takeover bid related costs.
50 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 2.2 Exceptional items Accounting policy Exceptional items are material items which, in managements judgement, derive from individual events that do not fall within the ordinary activities of the Group and that are identified as exceptional items by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.
The Directors believe the separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide an understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
Exceptional items are analysed below: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Exceptional items within operating costs Goodwill impairment 436 Property, plant and equipment write-off 42 Business restructuring 6 THUS integration 9 Demerger 2 Total exceptional operating costs 478 17 Other exceptional items Gain on sale of non-current assets 18 14 Taxation 146 Net exceptional costs 606 3 Details of the goodwill impairment are provided in note 3.3.
The write-off of property, plant and equipment was in respect of certain obsolete assets related to products and services discontinued following the strategic review carried out during the year.
In 2010 11 exceptional operating costs related to the demerger and the final stages of business restructuring and THUS integration projects, including 6 million relating to redundancies.
In 2011 12, an exceptional gain of 18 million arose on the sale of a subsidiary company with overseas tax losses that the Group would not have been able to utilise.
Sale proceeds of 18 million, after transaction costs, were received in cash.
In 2010 11 a gain of 14 million arose as a result of a similar transaction.
Details of the tax charge are included in note 2.3.
2.3 Income tax Accounting policy The tax charge or credit on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax and is recognised in the Consolidated income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of prior years.
The calculation of the total tax charge involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be fully determined until resolution is reached with the relevant tax authority.
Deferred tax is recognised for the expected future tax effect of temporary differences and unused tax losses, except where the difference arises from: the initial recognition of goodwill: or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, affecting neither accounting nor taxableprofit.
The deferred tax asset or liability is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
The recognition of deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Income tax charge The total taxation charge in the Consolidated income statement can be analysed as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Current tax charge Overseas tax 1 2 Adjustments relating to prior years 1 Total current tax charge 1 1 Deferred tax charge credit Write-off recognition of deferred tax assets 146 81 Effect of change in tax rates 2 11 Total deferred tax charge credit 148 70 Total income tax charge credit 149 69 There were no tax charges relating to items of other comprehensive income.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 51 The 146 million write-off of deferred tax assets has been classified as an exceptional tax charge.
The reduction in the deferred tax asset recognised on the Consolidated statement of financial position reflects the impact of the financial projections produced following a strategic review of the business undertaken in the first half of the year.
Based on these projections a lower level of probable future tax losses was estimated to be recoverable.
The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the loss profit before tax is as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Tax on loss profit at UK corporation tax rate of 26% 28% 102 39 Effect of overseas tax rates 1 1 Effect of disallowed expenditure 8 3 Movement in unrecognised temporary differences 19 41 Write-off recognition of deferred tax assets 146 81 Effect of change in tax rate from 26% to 24% 28% to 26% 2 11 Effect of goodwill impairment 113 Adjustments relating to prior years 1 Tax charge credit 149 69 A number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 has been enacted.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014, but these changes were not substantively enacted at the reporting date and, therefore, are not reflected in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The effect of the further changes from 24% to 22%, if applied to the measurement of deferred tax asset balances at the balance sheet date, would be to reduce the asset by 6 million being 3 million recognised in 2013 and 3 million recognised in 2014.
Deferred tax The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year are as follows: Capital allowances on Financial non-current position assets Tax losses Pensions Other offset Total m m m m m m Deferred tax assets 150 3 3 150 Deferred tax liabilities 3 3 At 1 April 2010 147 3 150 Amounts credited charged to the income statement 72 2 70 At 31 March 2011 219 1 220 Deferred tax assets 221 1 2 220 Deferred tax liabilities 2 2 At 31 March 2011 219 1 220 Amounts charged credited to the income statement 148 1 1 148 At 31 March 2012 71 2 1 72 Deferred tax assets 72 2 2 72 Deferred tax liabilities 1 1 2 At 31 March 2012 71 2 1 72 The expected utilisation of deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2012 is as follows: Deferred tax assets Deferred tax liabilities 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Within one year 10 40 2 2 After one year 64 182 74 222 2 2 Offset 2 2 2 2 Total 72 220 52 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following temporary differences gross : Capital allowances available on non-current assets Tax losses Pensions Other Total m m m m m As at 31 March 2011 3,380 16,226 91 151 19,848 As at 31 March 2012 3,814 13,567 102 94 17,577 The principal temporary difference arising in the UK is in respect of capital allowances.
If the corporation tax rate of 22%, as discussed above, had been enacted at the reporting date, the unrecognised deferred tax asset in respect of the temporary difference existing at the reporting date would reduce from 915 million to 839 million.
Tax losses recognised and unrecognised expire as follows: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Within one year 3 3 Within three years 5 7 Within five years 38 17 Within ten years 36 79 After more than ten years 53 30 Other tax losses totalling 13,432 million 31 March 2011: 16,090 million are not subject to expiry.
The 13,567 million 31 March 2011: 16,226 million gross losses include a UK capital loss of 5,197 million 31 March 2011: 5,197 million.
Other losses principally arose in overseas holding companies of 7,684 million 31 March 2011: 10,294 million in which the opportunity to realise benefits therefrom is considered remote and in overseas trading companies of 631 million 31 March 2011: 666 million where no deferred tax asset is recognised due to uncertainty as to the availability of future taxable profits.
Losses of 2,564 million in overseas holding companies were disposed of during the year.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 53 2.4 Earnings per share Earnings per share is the amount of post-tax profit or loss attributable to each share.
Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the result for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of all share options being exercised and assumes the 230 million convertible bond is converted to shares in the entity.
Basic earnings per share is adjusted in order to more accurately show the business performance of the Group on a consistent basis and to reflect how the business is measured and managed.
Adjusted earnings per share reflects earnings adjusted for exceptional items.

In calculating the diluted earnings loss per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Potential shares in relation to the convertible bond 225 million and share awards 73 million were excluded from the 2011 12 calculation of the diluted number of shares as the impact of these is anti-dilutive.
54 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Section 3 Operating assets and liabilities 3.1 Working capital Working capital represents the assets and liabilities the Group generates through its trading activities.
The Group defines working capital as inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
Accounting policies Inventories Inventories mainly comprise indefeasible rights of use IRUs over capacity bandwidth on subsea cable systems, both completed and in the course of construction.
They also include components held for sale, consumable items and project work in progress.
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is the price paid less any rebates, trade discounts or subsidies.
Italso includes delivery charges and import duties, but does not include value added taxes or advertising and administration costs.
Cost is based on the first-in, first-out FIFO principle.
For inventories held for resale, net realisable value is determined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less costs to sell.
For materials and consumables, an allowance is made for obsolete and slow moving inventories as required.
Receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value which, for items due in less than 12 months, is the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amount considered recoverable amortised cost.
Where receipts are not due for more than one year, fair value is their net present value to reflect the economic cost of delayed payment.
Any discount on the net present value is unwound using the effective interest method.
The Group provides goods and services to substantially all its customers on credit terms.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
These estimates include such factors as historical experience, ageing of customer accounts and customer creditworthiness.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is sufficient evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The carrying value of trade receivables is considered to approximate fair value.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at the value of the invoice received from the supplier.
The carrying value of trade payables is considered to approximate fair value.

Generally, interconnection agreements with major carriers result in receivables and payables balances with the same counterparty.
Industry practice is that receivable and payable amounts relating to interconnection revenue and costs for a defined period are agreed between counterparties and settled on a net basis.
Included within trade and other receivables are amounts relating to interconnection with other carriers of 124 million 31 March 2011: 197 million.
In most circumstances, the Group also has a corresponding payable to the receivable counterparty.
An analysis of movements in the provision for impairment against trade receivables in the year is as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m At 1 April 23 33 Receivables written off as uncollectible 3 10 Net release of provision 5 At 31 March 15 23 3.1.

Of the total shown above, 296 million 31 March 2011: 386 million are current financial liabilities comprising trade payables and other payables.
All current financial liabilities at 31March 2012 and 31 March 2011 have contractual maturities less than three months.
Of the deferred income shown above, 84 million 31 March 2011: 96 million relates to contracts where revenue will be recognised after one year.
3.2 Property, plant and equipment The Group invests substantial amounts of capital into maintaining the core network, customer contract infrastructure and new capability network.
The physical assets, which are primarily network infrastructure, used to generate revenue and profit are set out below.
Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment includes direct labour and related overhead costs incurred directly as a result of their construction or acquisition in addition to the physical assets themselves.
Costs relating to existing assets subsequently incurred are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that the future economic benefits will flow to the Group and the cost can be measured reliably.
All other subsequent costs primarily repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
The estimated costs of dismantling and removing assets and restoring sites on which they are located are included in the cost of property, plant and equipment.
The corresponding obligation is recognised as an asset retirement obligation provision in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Interest costs relating to borrowings for major capital projects are capitalised as part of the cost of assets when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group and the costs can be measured reliably.
The interest costs included are only those that are incurred up to the time that those projects are ready for service.
The Group assigns useful lives and residual values to property, plant and equipment based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and the intended use of those assets.
Changes in circumstances such as technological advances, prospective changes to expected period of use and physical condition of the assets concerned could result in the actual useful lives or residual values differing from initial estimates.
Where the Group determines that the useful life of property, plant and equipment should be shortened or residual value reduced, the net book value in excess of the residual value is depreciated over the revised remaining useful life, thereby increasing depreciation expense.
Any change in an assets life or residual value is reflected in the Groups financial statements when the change in estimate is determined.
Depreciation, the charge to the income statement to reflect annual wear and tear and the reduced value of the asset, is not recognised on freehold land or assets under construction.
For other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is recognised on the difference between the cost of an item and its estimated residual value, on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: Lives Network infrastructure: Cables up to 20 years Network equipment 3 to 25 years Ducting 40 years Other office equipment, computers etc 5 years Land and buildings: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold buildings up to 40 years or term of lease if less An assets carrying amount iswritten down to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount through sale or use.
Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are determined by reference to the proceeds and net book values.
Thesegains and losses are recognised in the income statement in other operating income expense.
Engineering spares held for use by the Group over a period exceeding one year are included in network infrastructure and depreciated over a period of five years.
They are stated atcost and include an appropriate allocation of direct labour and overheads.
The cost is determined on a weighted average basis.
Impairment The Directors assess the impairment of property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable or otherwise as required by accounting standards.
Factors that are considered important and which could trigger an impairment review include the following: obsolescence or physical damage: significant changes in technology and regulatory environments: significant under-performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results: significant changes in the use of the assets or the strategy of the overall business: significant negative industry or economic trends: and significant decline in the market capitalisation relative to net book value for a sustained period.
The identification of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of the recoverable amount forassetsor cash generating units requires significant judgement.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 57 Leases Leases of property, plant and equipment in which the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset or the present value of minimum lease payments and classified within property, plant and equipment.
Each lease payment is allocated between the underlying liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in Group debt see note 4.2.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the leaseterm.
All other leases are classified as operating leases and are not recognised in the statement of financial position.
Payments made under operating leases, net of lease incentives or premiums received, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Operating lease commitments are detailed in note 5.1.

Property, plant and equipment acquired during the year under finance leases totalled 28 million 2010 11: 58million.
Additions during the year include own work capitalised during the construction of certain assets of 70 million 2010 11: 63 million.
Disposals include amounts in respect of assets that have been retired with a cost of 206 million 2010 11: 275 million and net book value of nil 2010 11: nil.
The interest rate applied in determining the amount of interest capitalised in 2011 12 was approximately 8% 2010 11: 8%.
Capital commitments The Group had capital commitments at the end of the financial year relating to the purchase of network infrastructure of 62 million 31March 2011: 64 million.
No provision has been made for these commitments.
In addition, the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
The most significant of these relate to network operating and maintenance costs.
In the event of default of another party, the Group may be liable toadditional contributions under the terms of the agreements.
3.3 Intangible assets The Group has non-physical assets comprising software licences, customer contracts and relationships that it uses to generate revenue, profit and cash.
The Group also has goodwill that arose on previous business combinations.
Accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired subsidiary at the acquisition date.
The consideration is measured as the fair value of the assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued at the date of exchange.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included inintangible assets and is not amortised.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated, for impairment testing purposes, to an individual CGU or groups of CGUs, representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Board.
It is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
58 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Other intangible assets Costs that are directly associated with the purchase and implementation of identifiable software products by the Group are recognised as intangible assets.
Expenditure that enhances and extends the benefits of computer software programs beyond their original specifications and lives are recognised as a capital improvement and added to the original cost of the software.
Expenditure is only capitalised if costs can be measured reliably, the product is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development and to use the asset.
Intangible assets relating to licences and customer contracts obtained as part of the Groups business combinations are recorded initially at their fair values.
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less amortisation on a straight-line basis over the following periods: Lives Software 3 to 5 years Licences 25 years or less if the licence term is shorter Customer contracts 4 to 15 years Other 3 to 5 years Impairment The Group assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may notbe recoverable or otherwise as required by relevant accounting standards.
Further, goodwill is not subject to amortisation as it is tested annually for impairment.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash generating units.
The Group determines any impairment by comparing the carrying values of each of the Groups assets or cash generating units to which it belongs to their recoverable amounts which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Fair value represents market value in an active market.
Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows arising from the asset.
Future cash flows are determined with reference to the Groups own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost ofcapital for the business.
Impairment reviews involve management making assumptions and estimates, which are highly judgemental and susceptible to change.
Intangible assets Intangible assets can be analysed as follows: Licences and Customer operating contracts and Goodwill Software agreements relationships Total m m m m m Cost At 1 April 2010 800 705 7 145 1,657 Additions 31 31 Exchange differences 1 1 At 31 March 2011 799 736 7 145 1,687 Additions 26 26 Disposals 108 5 113 Transfer between asset categories 6 6 At 31 March 2012 799 648 8 145 1,600 Amortisation and impairment At 1 April 2010 658 3 64 725 Charge for the year 30 1 12 43 At 31 March 2011 688 4 76 768 Charge for the year 23 1 17 41 Impairment 436 436 Disposals 107 4 111 Transfer between asset categories 6 6 At 31 March 2012 436 598 7 93 1,134 Net book value At 31 March 2012 363 50 1 52 466 At 31 March 2011 799 48 3 69 919 Impairment review The Group experienced weaker than anticipated business performance during the year in the extremely challenging UK economic climate.
This, together with the existence of updated five year projections for the business produced following a strategic review undertaken in the firsthalf of the year, prompted an impairment test at 30 September 2011.
The outcome of this review was that the value in use calculated using discounted cash flow projections of the business did not support thegoodwill arising on the acquisitions of Energis in 2005 and THUS in 2009 subsumed within the Cable&Wireless Worldwide business.
Thisresulted in an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the Cable&Wireless Worldwide cash generating unit CGU of 426million at 30 September 2011, details of which are set out below.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 59 The Group performed its annual assessment for impairment of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide CGU, at 31 March 2012.
In the second half of the year, following the appointment of Gavin Darby as Chief Executive Officer, management continued to refine the five-year plan for the business, based upon latest trading and economic conditions, trends and strategy, which provided updated projections to use in the annual impairment test at 31 March 2012.
No further impairment of the CGU arose following this assessment at 31 March 2012.
The recoverable amount of the CGU at 30 September 2011 and 31 March 2012, and in previous reporting periods, was determined as its value in use, using assumptions as to the continuing operations of Cable&Wireless Worldwide based upon the latest five year projections, approved by management.
The impairment tests carried out as at 31 March 2012, 30 September 2011 and 31 March 2011 were performed using the following assumptions: i Cash flows resulting from new investments were excluded from the value in use calculation.
The cash flow projections derived from the five year financial plan reflect managements expectations of levels of revenue, EBITDA and capital expenditure together with working capital requirements and operating cash flows.
These key assumptions were determined using a combination of extrapolations of historical trends within the business, telecommunication industry estimates and in-house estimates of future performance.
ii Cash flows beyond this projected period were extrapolated using an estimated long term growth rate.
For this a rate of 0.5% 30 September 2011: 0.5%, 31 March 2011: 1.0% was used to extrapolate the cash flow projections into perpetuity.
This growth rate was determined using long-term historical growth rates of the CGU excluding the impact of investment, had been benchmarked and did not exceed the long-term average growth rates for our industry.
iii A pre-tax discount rate of 10.2% 30 September 2011: 10.8%, 31 March 2011: 9.1% was used to discount projected cash flows of the CGU.
The discount rate reflected the time value of money and was derived from the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The discount rate reflected the latest market assumptions of the risk free rate for 20 year UK government bonds, adjusted for an equity risk premium, the net cost of debt and market assumptions on the Companys cost of equity beta.
Taking into account the updated projections produced at 31 March 2012, which showed improved performance over the five year period compared to the projections prepared at 30 September 2011, management consider there is no reasonably possible change in assumptions used in the impairment review of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide CGU at 31 March 2012 that would result in the carrying amount exceeding its value in use.
As at 31 March 2011 management estimated that a reasonably possible increase in the discount rate used to discount projected cash flows by more than 1.4 percentage points would trigger an impairment.
The Group also considered the recoverable amount of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide CGU with reference to the recommended cash offer made by the Vodafone Group on 23 April 2012.
This assessment indicated a recoverable amount exceeding the carrying value of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide CGU at 31 March 2012.
An impairment test of the Apollo CGU at 30 September 2011 indicated that the carrying amount of the CGU was higher than its recoverable amount and total goodwill allocated to this CGU amounting to 10 million was written off in full.
This impairment arose following the increase in discount rate to 10.8% for the reasons set out above.
Any reasonably possible adverse change in assumptions for this CGU will result in a further impairment.
The annual assessment for impairment of the Apollo CGU identified no further impairment to be recognised at 31 March 2012.
3.4 Provisions Provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount.
Accounting policies Provisions are recognised in the Consolidated statement of financial position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation asa result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can bereliably estimated.
Estimates are required to quantify such amounts.
Provisions are presented in the Statement of financial position at the present value of the estimated future outflows expected to be required tosettle the obligation.
The discount rate is the pre-tax rate reflecting the assessment of the settlement date.
The impact of discount rate changes on provisions is recognised in the income statement in other operating income expense, except in respect of asset retirement obligations where the impact is recognised as an increase or decrease in the related tangible fixed asset.
The unwinding of any discount is recognised as a finance expense.
Provisions are recognised for unavoidable property lease payments in onerous contracts as the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sublet.
Redundancy provisions comprise employee termination payments.
Legal provisions comprise legal fees and, where appropriate, expected settlement costs.
Provisions can be analysed as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 Network Network and asset and asset Redundancy retirement Redundancy retirement Property costs obligations Other Total Property costs obligations Other Total m m m m m m m m m m At 1 April 62 3 112 8 185 71 6 110 16 203 Additional provisions 7 21 14 4 46 10 13 6 13 42 Amounts used 13 8 1 1 23 14 14 6 15 49 Unused amounts reversed 1 1 4 6 6 2 1 6 15 Effect of discounting 1 4 5 1 3 4 At 31 March 56 15 125 11 207 62 3 112 8 185 Provisions current 14 15 1 11 41 16 3 3 8 30 Provisions non-current 42 124 166 46 109 155 60 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Property Provision has been made for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments and dilapidations or cost to exit vacant properties.
The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract lives which are for periods upto20 years from 31 March 2012.
The increase in property provisions in the year of 7 million related to the impact of a change in discount rate assumptions reflecting the movement in government bond rates.
Property provisions released during the year were as a result of the sub-letting of previously vacant properties or leases where dilapidations and other exit costs were less than previously provided for.
Redundancy In the years presented, redundancy provisions included the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date.
Amounts provided for during the year related to the cost of redundancies arising in the normal course of business.
The provision is expected to be used within one year.
Network and asset retirement obligations Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity.
These provisions are expected to be used over the remaining lease periods, the majority of which being no more than seven years.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites, technical sites, domestic andsub-sea cabling.
This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arose.
Provision raised in the year of 14 million primarily related to the impact of a change in discount rate assumptions reflecting the movement ingovernment bond rates, used in calculating the asset retirement obligations.
Amounts utilised related predominantly to cash expenditure against unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.
Other Other provisions include specific legal claims against the Group and provision for employee long term incapacity benefit.
3.5 Retirement benefits obligations The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.
These schemes include both defined benefit schemes, where retirement benefits are based on employees remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with recommendations from independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Accounting policy Defined contribution scheme A defined contribution scheme is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a third party.
The Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis and has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense as they are incurred.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Defined benefit schemes The Group provides several defined benefit pension schemes for its employees.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
These schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or Trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The liability recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of each defined benefit pension plan represents the fairvalue of plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligations at the reporting date.
The expected cost of providing these defined benefit pensions will depend on an assessment of such factors as: the life expectancy of the members: the length of service: the rate of salary increases: the rate of return earned on assets in the future: the rate used to discount future pension liabilities: and future inflation rates.
The assumptions used by the Group are set out below and are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice, but are subject to independent actuarial advice.
Changes to these assumptions could materially affect the size of the defined benefit schemes liabilities and assets.
Defined benefit obligations foreach scheme are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of these obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.
The corporate bonds used have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses, arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions, in the period in which they occur in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employee remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
Inthese cases, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Current service costs and any past service costs, together with the unwinding of the discount on plan liabilities less the expected return on plan assets, are included within operating costs.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 61 The IAS 19 surplus or deficit of defined benefit funds is adjusted to reflect the future economic benefits available in the form of a cash refund or a reduction in future contributions, allowing for minimum funding contributions in accordance with IFRIC 14.
Any adjustment torestrict a surplus is recorded in other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution schemes The pension cost for the year for the Groups defined contribution schemes was 20 million 2010 11: 19 million.
Defined benefit schemes CWWRP The Cable & Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CWWRP provides defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements for current and former employees of the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group.
The CWWRP has been closed to new defined benefit members since its inception in 2010.
No new defined benefit members have entered the predecessor scheme Cable & Wireless Superannuation Fund, from which the CWWRP was established on the Groups demerger from the Cable & Wireless Communications Group, since 1998.
The terms of the CWWRP Trust Deed allow the Trustee or the Company to call for a valuation at any time.
The first funding valuation of the CWWRP, as at 30 September 2010, has been completed and showed a past service deficit of 248 million.
As a result, a new funding plan has been agreed with the scheme Trustee which includes a payment of 100 million that was made during the year followed by further payments of 15 million in each of the next two financial years, 20 million per annum for the subsequent three years and a final payment of 12 million in 2017 18.
This plan constitutes a minimum funding requirement and in accordance with IFRIC 14 The Limits on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, an adjustment against the excess of scheme assets over its liabilities, recorded directly in equity, of 139 million was made at 31 March 2012.
A further 25 million deficit funding contribution was paid during the year under the preceding funding agreement.
The ongoing contribution rate includes an allowance of 3% of pensionable earnings for administration expenses, excluding the Pension Protection Fund PPF levy.
The Group paid a total ongoing contribution rate of 35.6% until 31 December 2011 and 24.7% thereafter to the CWWRP in respect of its current and former employees, being 13 million 2010 11: 9.1 million.
Other schemes The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group also operates the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme.
An independent actuarial valuation of the THUS Group plc Pension Scheme carried out with an effective date of 31 December 2008 showed a deficit of 2 million on a funding basis.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide made a one-off 1 million contribution on 31 March 2010 in order to fully fund this scheme on a continuing basis.
Thefunding valuation of the THUS Group scheme, as at 31 December 2011, is in progress.
The Group also operates defined benefit arrangements in Hong Kong and Ireland, unfunded liabilities in the UK relating to pension provision for former Directors and other senior employees in respect of their earnings in excess of the previous Inland Revenue salary cap, and other small defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements in the UK.
IAS 19 valuation IAS 19 valuations of the defined benefit pension schemes operated by the Group have been updated to 31 March 2012 by qualified independent actuaries, Lane Clark & Peacock LLP.
The main financial assumptions applied to the CWWRP and other schemes and an analysis of the schemes assets at 31 March 2012 and 31March 2011 are as follows: 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 Other Other CWWRP schemes CWWRP schemes Assets Assumption Assets Assumption Assets Assumption Assets Assumption m % m % m % m % Inflation assumption RPI 3.2 3.2 3.4 3.4 Inflation assumption CPI 2.2 2.2 2.7 2.7 Salary increases 3.7 3.7 3.9 3.7 Pension increases 2.0 3.1 3.1 2.2 3.3 3.2 Discount rate 4.9 4.9 5.6 5.6 Long-term expected rate of return by assettype Annuity policies 355 4.9 1 4.9 323 5.6 Equities 534 7.8 99 7.6 557 8.1 94 7.8 Bonds and gilts 400 3.5 47 3.7 182 4.5 45 5.0 Property 31 5.0 32 6.7 6.7 Cash and swaps 248 3.0 145 3.6 1 3.7 1,568 147 1,239 140 Assumptions used are best estimates from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions shown above for Other schemes represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual schemes.
Excluding the annuities, which are measured at the value of the obligation to which they relate, the overall expected rate of return for each pension scheme is a weighted average of the expected asset return for each asset class.
The expected asset return for each asset class has been set as a best estimate of the long-term return that will be achieved for the particular asset class in the country in question having regard to investment yields on the measurement date.
Mortality rates are also used for calculating the defined benefit obligation in the statement of financial position.
The assumptions regarding mortality rates in retirement for the CWWRP as at 31 March 2012 use the S1NA tables with a -1.0 year age rating, subject to improvements in line with the CMI 2009 projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for both males and females.
62 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Based on these assumptions, the life expectancy of pensioners aged 60 in the CWWRP are as follows: Age 60 Age 60 Age 60 in 2012 in 2022 in 2032 years years years Male 28.2 29.5 30.7 Female 30.7 32.0 33.3 A one year increase in the life expectancy assumptions would have increased the CWWRP liabilities by approximately 32 million as at31March 2012.
The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy is 8million.
A 0.25% per annum decrease in the discount rate used to value the scheme liabilities would have increased the liabilities by around 85million.
The corresponding increase in the value of assets due to the change in the estimated value of the annuity policy is 14 million.
A 0.25% per annum change in the assumed rate of salary increases would have changed the liabilities by around 5 million.
The CWWRP is closed to new entrants.
Under the projected unit credit method used for the valuation of liabilities, the current service cost is expected to increase when expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Inflation measure: CPI v RPI In July 2010 the UK Government announced that the Consumer Prices Index CPI should replace the Retail Prices Index RPI as the statutory minimum inflation measure to be used in determining pension increases, where the scheme rules and historic practice permits, for private sector defined benefit pension schemes.
The use of CPI rather than RPI to value deferred pensions and increases in the post-1988 Guaranteed Minimum Pensions in payment for the CWWRP was communicated to members in April 2011.
This has resulted in a reduction in the net obligation by 5 million with the recognition of the credit to the income statement in accordance with guidance in UITF Abstract 48.
Further, under the Rules of the CWWRP, a members pension is provided with inflationary increases between when they leave service and when they retire by at least the level required by statute.
For certain members this statutory underpin in deferment applies and so the expected future level of their benefit has reduced.
The impact of the change in the inflation assumption for the underpin, of 16 million, has been recognised as an actuarial gain in equity in the year ended 31 March 2012 following the introduction of the use of CPI from April 2011.
The Group is still in the process of taking legal advice on this matter, being mindful of recent legal cases having been brought against the governments use of CPI as the measure for increases to public sector pensions, to determine whether the scheme rules of the CWWRP permit the use of CPI as an indexation measure for the remaining parts of the scheme.
In the case of this particular pension scheme the issue is complex and therefore the matter had not been concluded upon at 31 March 2012.
As a result, the Group continued to use RPI as its best estimate of the appropriate indexation measure.

The Board has completed the early refinancing of the revolving credit facilities available to the Group, replacing the 300 million facility due 31March 2013, with a 260 million facility due in June 2015.
The facility has a break clause at 30 June 2014 which is conditional upon alternative arrangements being put in place in relation to the 230 million convertible bonds that mature in November 2014.
The Boards focus during the year has been to ensure the cash requirements of the business, determined as part of the strategic review, can be met.
During the year the decision was taken to halve, and then suspend dividend payments going forward until such time that free cash flow comfortably covers proposed dividends.
The Board is mindful that raising equity at current share price levels is not easily justified, and would only be likely in the context of an acquisition.
The Group focuses on managing cash flows and net debt and as this improves, the Board will review its policies on capital structure to support the performance improvement plan.
Capital management The Group defines capital as net debt and shareholders equity as analysed as follows: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Net debt see note 4.1 168 9 Shareholders equity 772 1,555 Total capital 940 1,564 The Group does not have any externally imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by company law.
It manages its capital to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to achieve its strategic objectives and to minimise cost of finance, taking into account: i The liquidity required in light of the projected funding requirements of the Groups operating businesses with an appropriate level ofcontingency: ii the level of financial strength required to maintain the Groups terms of trade taking account of its operational cash generation: iii the relative cost of debt and equity: and iv the extent to which external debt finance is, or is likely to be, available to the Group on acceptable terms.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders, or sell assets to reduce debt, or generate cash.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit borrowing up to three times the adjusted capital and reserves of the Group.
Further, relationships are maintained with a selected group of major international banks in the event that further funding is required by the business.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders.
This process is managed through the Groups budget and longer-term forecasting process.
4.1 Net debt Net debt is the Groups debt net of cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and at bank and short-term deposits, primarily money market funds.
Cash equivalents are highly liquid monetary investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Loans, bonds and obligations under finance leases make up the Groups debt.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 65 Accounting policy Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Bank overdrafts are included within loans in current liabilities on the statement of financial position.
Analysis of changes in net debt: Finance eases entered Other At 1 April into during non-cash At 31 March 2011 Cash flow the year movements 2012 m m m m m Cash at bank and in hand 98 48 1 49 Short-term deposits 168 111 57 Cash and cash equivalents 266 159 1 106 Debt due within one year 30 34 10 29 35 Debt due after one year 245 18 24 239 Total debt 275 34 28 5 274 Total net debt 9 125 28 6 168 Short-term bank deposits consist primarily of money market deposits, which can be readily converted to cash at short notice.
Theeffective interest rate on short-term bank deposits at 31 March 2012 was 0.81% 31 March 2011: 0.46%.
At 31 March 2012 these depositshad an average maturity of 2 days 31 March 2011: 2 days.
Other non-cash movements in total net debt consist of the accretion of the convertible bond by 5 million and the movement of the finance lease liability now due within one year, from debt due after one year.
A reconciliation of net cash flow to movement in net debt is as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Decrease increase in cash during the year 159 41 Decrease in debt and lease financing 34 37 Cash outflow inflow in net debt 125 78 Finance leases entered into during the year 28 58 Non-cash finance charges 5 3 Conversion of trade payables to debt 5 Exchange differences 1 1 Movement in net debt in the year 159 11 Net debt at 1 April 9 20 Net debt at 31 March 168 9 Free cash flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, defined by management and represents the cash generated by the operations of the business to cover repayment of borrowings and available to distribute to equity shareholders.
Free cash flow is defined as the net cash flow before repayment of, and proceeds from, borrowings other than finance leases, dividends paid and proceeds from share issues.

Accounting policy Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the loans using the effective interest method.
Finance lease liabilities are stated at the present value of the minimum future lease payments.
Periodic lease payments are allocated between the reduction of the lease liability and an interest charge on the outstanding balance so as to recognise interest at a constant periodic rate.
l 66 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 Convertible bonds bonds that can be converted into share capital at the option of the holder issued by the Group are initially recognised at fair value.
The bonds are separated into liability and equity components on initial recognition.
The liability component is initially recognised at the fair value of a similar liability without an equity conversion option.
The equity component represents the fair value ofthebond less the liability component.
Any directly attributable transaction costs are allocated to the liability and equity components inproportion to their initial carrying amounts.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the liability component of the bond is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The equity component is not remeasured subsequent to initial recognition.
Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12months after the reporting date where they are classified as non-current liabilities.
Loans and obligations under finance leases can be analysed as follows: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Loans Sterling 230 million convertible bonds due 2014 211 206 US dollar loan repayable within 12 months 1 1 212 207 Loans current 1 1 Loans non-current 211 206 Finance leases Obligations under finance leases 62 68 Obligations under finance leases current 34 29 Obligations under finance leases non-current 28 39 Loans and obligations under finance leases current 35 30 Loans and obligations under finance leases non-current 239 245 Loans The contractual undiscounted cash flow profile of loans including interest payable at rates prevailing at the reporting date, by when they fall due for payment, is as follows: 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Loans Due in less than one year 14 14 Due in more than one year but not more than two years 13 13 Due in more than two years but not more than five years 242 255 269 282 Convertible bonds The convertible bonds of 230 million are due in 2014 15.
On 8 June 2011 the conversion price was adjusted from 108 pence to 106 pence pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds on occurrence of certain corporate events, in this case being the payment of the cash dividend to shareholders in respect of the year ended 31 March 2011.
On 23 November 2011 the conversion price was further adjusted from 106 pence to 102 pence as a result of the payment of the interim dividend to shareholders.
Each bond entitles the holder to convert the amount of such bond into fully paid ordinary shares of 5 pence each at a rate of 98,039 shares for each 100,000 held at the conversion price of 102 pence per ordinary share.
Unless previously redeemed, converted or purchased and cancelled, the convertible bonds will be redeemed on 24 November 2014 at their principal amount.
The bonds carry a coupon of 5.75% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears with the exception of a short last coupon on the maturity date.
The convertible bonds are senior debt obligations.
They contain a negative pledge which provides that, so long as any of the convertible bonds remain outstanding, Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc and its principal subsidiaries will not create or permit to subsist security upon their respective assets to secure, guarantee or indemnify any other debt instruments which are listed or capable of being listed.
US dollar loan The US dollar loan is due to a non-controlling interest in a subsidiary undertaking.
Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 67 Obligations under finance leases The Group enters into finance leases to acquire network and customer fixed assets where it is able to secure financing at rates deemed acceptable and where it assists with working capital requirements of the business.
The repayment profile of obligations and the present value of future minimum finance lease repayments under non-cancellable finance lease agreements are as follows: Net finance lease Minimum finance lease liabilities payments 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Due not later than one year 34 29 37 33 Due later than one year, but not later than five years 27 38 28 40 Due in more than five years 1 1 1 1 Total 62 68 66 74 Less future finance charges on finance leases 4 6 Present value of finance lease liabilities 62 68 Fair values The book value and fair value of the non-current borrowings are as follows: Book value Fair value 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Convertible bond 211 206 214 213 Finance leases 28 39 26 38 239 245 240 251 The fair values above which are determined for disclosure purposes, are calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
The fair value of current borrowings equals their carrying amount, as the impact of discounting is not significant.
4.3 Net finance income and expense Finance income comprises interest receivable on the Groups financial assets.
Finance expense comprises interest payable on the Groups borrowings and other financial liabilities, unwinding of discounts on provisions and capitalised financing costs written off.
Accounting policy Interest income and expense is recognised as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest method.
Net finance expense can be analysed as follows: 2011 12 2010 11 m m Finance income Interest on cash and short term deposits 1 1 Interest on receivables 2 Total finance income 1 3 Finance expense Bank charges and loan interest 9 9 Interest on convertible bond 18 17 Finance charges on leases 4 3 Capitalised financing costs written off 3 Unwinding of discounts on provisions 5 5 39 34 Interest capitalised 6 4 Total finance expense 33 30 Net finance expense 32 27 Capitalised financing costs written off relates to accelerated amortisation of previously capitalised borrowing costs associated with the 300 million revolving credit facility that was replaced by a new facility during the year.
68 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 4.4 Financial risk management Treasury policy The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Day-to-day management of treasury activities is delegated to the Groups Treasury function Treasury, within specified financial limits for eachtype of transaction and counterparty.
To the extent that subsidiaries undertake treasury transactions, these are governed by Group policies and delegated authorities.
Material subsidiary positions are monitored by Treasury.
Where appropriate, transactions are reported to and, if necessary approved by, the Group Board.
The key responsibilities of Treasury include funding, investment of surplus cash and the management of interest rate and foreign currency risk.
The majority of the Groups cash resources and borrowings are managed centrally by Treasury.
The Group may use derivatives such as forward foreign exchange contracts in the management of its foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
The use of these instruments would be in accordance with strategies agreed by Treasury, subject to policies approved by the Board.
Derivatives are not used for trading or speculative purposes and all derivative transactions and positions are monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Group may apply hedge accounting treatment on these derivative positions if appropriate, on a case by case basis.
Currency risk Although the Group trades in several countries, the majority of the Groups revenue is earned in pounds sterling.
The Groups main foreign currency exposure relates to movements in exchange rates for foreign currency receipts and payments in euros and US dollars.
Exchange risk is measured on the basis of net current or future foreign currency payments.
Where appropriate the Group may manage its exposure to movements in exchange rates on a net basis and use forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the exposures created where currencies do not naturally offset in the short-term.
The Group may undertake hedges to minimise the exposure to individual transactions that create significant foreign exchange exposures for the Group where appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are denominated in the following currencies: 31 March 2012 31 March 2011 Cash and Cash and cash cash equivalents Borrowings equivalents Borrowings m m m m Sterling 79 273 228 274 US dollar 7 1 24 1 Euro 3 9 Other currencies 17 5 106 274 266 275 At 31 March 2012 the Groups balances in foreign currencies primarily comprise intercompany loans which are considered to be part of the net investment in its subsidiaries.
Any foreign exchange differences arising on such balances are recognised in equity and recycled to the income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Other monetary foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities largely eliminate and hence, the net exposure to foreign exchange differences is minimal.
No sensitivity analysis has therefore been prepared as the Groups results for the year would not have been materially impacted by a 10% change in foreign exchange rates.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk the Group is impacted by changes in interest rates.
At 31 March 2012 100% 31 March 2011: 100% of the Groups borrowings were at a fixed rate.
A reduction in interest rates would have anunfavourable impact upon the fair value of the Groups fixed rate borrowings.
However, no debt is held for trading purposes and it is intended that it will be kept in place until maturity.
As a result, there is no exposure to fair value loss on fixed rate borrowings and, as such, it has not been modelled.
The Group is exposed to insignificant risk due to movements in interest rates on its surplus cash balances.
There were no interest rate derivatives in place at 31 March 2012 31 March 2011: none.
Credit risk Cash deposits, trade and other receivables and similar financial instruments give rise to credit risk, which represents the loss that would be recognised if a counterparty failed to perform as contracted.
The Group treasury policy, as approved by the Board, specifies maximum exposure to one counterparty and the types of instruments that may be used for investment purposes.
Management seeks to reduce risk by ensuring the counterparties to all but a small proportion of the Groups financial instruments meet various criteria stress tested Tier 1 capital and credit ratings : the hurdles are higher for investments with a term greater than three months than those of a term less than three months.
Inaddition, the maximum amount and duration of investment is determined by counterparty rating, the minimum acceptable short term rating being B Standard & Poor and Fitch or NP Moodys.
The table below summarises the Groups credit risk associated with its deposits of cash and cash equivalents where deposits with individual institutions exceeds 10 million.

There is no material difference between the carryingvalue and fair value of trade and other receivables presented.
Concentrations of credit risks with respect to trade receivables are small as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
 relate to governments and corporate entities including other telecommunications operators.
Credit risk procedures vary depending on the size or type of customer.
These procedures include such activities as credit checks, payment history analysis and credit approval limits.
Based on these procedures, management assessed the credit quality of those receivables that are neither past due nor impaired as low risk.
There have been no significant changes to the composition of receivables counterparties within the Group that indicate this would change in the future.
There has been an economic downturn in markets in which the Group operates.
This would indicate an increased credit risk on receivables that are neither past due nor impaired.
However, management have assessed this risk and, after providing additional valuation allowance where necessary, continue to support the assessment of credit risk as low.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of 106 million.
These amounts are highly liquid and are a significant component of the Groups overall liquidity and capital resources.
An analysis of the maturity of the Groups financial instruments is contained in notes 3.1.
During the year the Group secured a new 260 million sterling revolving credit facility, which is available for the period to June 2015.
This facility was not drawn down at 31 March 2012.
The facility is secured by way of guarantee from Cable & Wireless Worldwide plc and other Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group companies and security over assets of the Group.
Under the facility, the Group is permitted to enter into further bilateral facilities with the lenders of up to 150 million, subject to certain conditions.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on a regular basis to ensure the utilisation of current facilities is optimised, to ensure covenant compliance and that medium-term liquidity is maintained and for the purpose of identifying long-term strategic funding requirements.
TheDirectors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
The majority of the Groups cash is held centrally and is predominantly invested in short-term bank deposits.
4.5 Equity Accounting policy Share based payments The Group operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans as part of the overall remuneration philosophy.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options or share awards is recognised as an expense over the vesting period.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options or share awards granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, service, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options or share awards that are expected to vest.
At each reporting date, theGroup revises its estimates of the number of options or share awards that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision oforiginal non-market estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options areexercised.
1 Share capital and reserves Share capital movements in the reported periods relate to shares issued under employee share incentive schemes and as scrip dividends.
TheGroups share capital and share premium is set out below: Share Share Number of capital premium shares m m Issued, called-up and fully paid ordinary shares of 5 pence each At 1 April 2010 2,624,572,024 131 56 Issued under share schemes 10,333,826 1 2 Issued under scrip dividends 43,876,400 2 2 At 31 March 2011 2,678,782,250 134 56 Issued under share schemes 21,767,025 1 2 Issued under scrip dividends 46,526,195 2 2 At 31 March 2012 2,747,075,470 137 56 The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2011 12 or 2010 11.
The Company did not have any Treasury shares outstanding during the year 2010 11: nil.
The issue of shares in lieu of cash dividends scrip dividend is considered a bonus issue under the terms of the Companies Act 2006 and the nominal value of the shares is charged to the share premium account.
Foreign currency translation reserve The foreign currency translation reserve contains exchange differences on translation of subsidiaries with a functional currency different tothe presentation currency of the Group and exchange differences on intercompany funding loans to subsidiaries.
Capital reserve At 31 March 2012 the balance on the capital reserve was 586 million 31 March 2011: 1,386 million.
The capital reserve was created as a result of a court approved capital reduction scheme in accordance with section 641 of the Companies Act 2006.
