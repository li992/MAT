Notes to the Parent Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012 164 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 1.
Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation These financial statements represent the individual Parent Company.
These financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The Directors have reviewed the Companys existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with last year.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
The functional and presentation currency of the Company is US dollars.
b Fixed asset investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment.
Investments are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds the higher of net realisable value and the discounted future earnings from the investment.
c Financial assets and liabilities Amounts owed to Group companies and term borrowings, which are interest and non-interest bearing, are initially recorded at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Finance income and expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis using the effective interest method.
d Financial guarantees Financial guarantees are contracts that require the Company to make specified payments to reimburse the holder of the guarantee for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the terms of a debt instrument.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee.
Financial guarantees are recognised when a premium is paid or in the case of premium-free guarantees such as intragroup guarantees when the borrower receives the money from the financing entity.
When the Company issues a premium-free guarantee or a guarantee at a premium different from market premium, fair value is determined using valuation techniques e. g. market prices of similar instruments, interest-rate differentials, etc.
The fair value of premium-free guarantees issued by the Company in respect of its subsidiaries borrowings are accounted for as capital contributions and recognised as an increase in the cost of investment in the subsidiaries.
Financial guarantee liabilities are amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the guarantees with respective income presented within other operating income.
At each reporting date, the guarantees are measured at the higher of i the unamortised balance of the amount at initial recognition and ii the best estimate of expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date.
e Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Our competitive Sustainable Financial review advantage Strategy in action development review Operational review and risk management Governance Financials ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 165 f Taxation including deferred tax Current tax in respect of the taxable profit or loss for a period is provided using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except where otherwise prescribed by the financial reporting standards.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised in respect of all timing differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in the profit and loss account for the period except to the extent that it is attributable to a gain or a loss recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, in which case tax attributable to that gain or loss is also recognised directly in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
g Share-based payments The Company has adopted a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and a Deferred Share Plan DSP designed to reward senior management of the Group for achieving the Groups strategic objectives and provide an appropriate level of long-term performance related pay.
Each year, participants will receive conditional awards of shares in the Company which will normally vest three years after they are awarded.
This is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions, measured over a three-year performance period and continued service.
The share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Companys financial statements and is measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date of grant.
The estimated fair value of each share granted under the LTIP and DSP is calculated by applying Monte Carlo and Black Scholes models respectively.
In accordance with FRS 20, where a Parent Company grants equity instruments rights to employees of a subsidiary, and such sharebased compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the Consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent, the Company is required to record an addition to the Companys investment in subsidiaries, with a corresponding increase recognised in other reserves, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Failure to vest as a result of market conditions is not reversed.
Further details on the share-based payments can be found in the Directors Remuneration report and notes to the Consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report and Accounts.
h Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or on the balance sheet date.
Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or when declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Taxation including deferred tax As at 31 December 2012, the Company has not recognised deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses of US$30 million 2011: US$14 million and other deductible timing differences of US$3 million 2011: US$4 million on the basis of insufficient evidence of taxable profits being available against which the deferred tax asset may be utilised.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset will be recognised in periods in which losses are utilised against taxable profits.
The main UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
A further reduction to 23% with effect from 1 April 2013 was enacted on 17 July 2012.
On the basis the Company does not have any recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date, no remeasurement of these balances is necessary.
In December 2012, a reduction in the applicable rate of corporation tax to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 was announced and in March 2013, a further reduction in the applicable rate to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015 was announced.
These changes have not been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Our competitive Sustainable Financial review advantage Strategy in action development review Operational review and risk management Governance Financials SRK independent expert mineral resource and ore reservesreportfor the year ended 31 December 2012 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 169 SRK Consulting UK Ltd. SRK has reviewed and restated the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for the various assets of the Group ENRC PLC and each of its subsidiaries in line with the 2004 Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves the JORC Code as published by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.
For the Kazakhstan assets this involved reviewing the State Commission on Mineral Reserves GKZ reserve statements as prepared in accordance with the local regulatory requirements of Kazakhstan, as of 31 December 2012.
SRK has modified and translated the Groups GKZ reserve statements and restated these as Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the terms and definitions given in the JORC Code, without recourse to fundamental recalculation.
For the Groups assets, SRK has either generated the Resource and Reserve statements, or reviewed and signed-off on internationally recognised Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates undertaken either by the Group, or by independent third party consultants.
All Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Ore Reserves, where appropriate.
In 2007, SRK prepared an independent Mineral Experts Report MER on the mining, processing, smelting and power generating assets of the Group.
Subsequent to the MER, SRK has prepared annual updates of the JORC Code compliant Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves of the Groups Kazakhstan assets.
In addition, SRK has reviewed and restated Mineral Resources and, where applicable, Ore Reserves for the Groups international assets.
Site visits to the Kazakhstan assets are being undertaken on a two to three-year rotation basis.
Site visits to Kazchromes Donskoy GOK chrome operations and Zhairemsky GOKs manganese and iron-manganese operations were undertaken in February 2009 and February 2012.
Site visits to Eurasian Energy Corporations EEC Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine and the SSGPO iron ore mines were undertaken in February 2010 and November 2012.
Aluminium of Kazakhstans AoK KBRU and TBRU bauxite mines were most recently visited in February 2011.
The team for the February 2012 visit to Zhairemsky GOK also visited Kazchromes Kazmarganets manganese mining operations.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve Statements as of 31 December 2011 form the basis for the current update.
Shubarkol Komir JSCs coal mine was visited in November 2012 as part of the annual audit process.
The basis for Shubarkols Coal Resource and Reserve statement is the estimate that resulted from the pre-acquisition due diligence, which was undertaken by SRK in early 2012.
In addition to the Kazakhstan assets, various Mineral Resource and, where appropriate, Ore Reserve statements have been reviewed and restated for inclusion in the Groups Annual Report and Accounts 2012.
These are further detailed below and in summary are for: Bahia Minerao Limitadas Bamin Pedra fide Ferro and Jurema iron ore projects in Brazil: Boss Minings and Socit Minire fide Kabolela et Kipese Sprls SMKK copper and cobalt assets in the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC : La Congolaise fide Mines et fide Dveloppement Comide sprl Comide, a subsidiary of Camrose Resource Limited Camrose, copperand cobalt assets in the DRC: Treatment of Kingamyambo Tailings Company Metalkol, a subsidiary of Camrose, copper and cobalt assets in the DRC: Frontier SPRLs Frontier copper project in the DRC: Todal Mining Pvt Ltds Todal Bokai platinum project in Zimbabwe: and ENRC Mozambique Limitadas Estima coal project in Mozambique.
The dates of these statements relied on data availability and are therefore not necessarily stated as per 31 December 2012.
Site visits to the DRC, Zimbabwe and Mozambique assets were most recently carried out in March and April 2012.
SRK has reviewed the Ore Reserve statements in conjunction with the Groups price forecasts.
The real long-term prices used by SRK to support the current Ore Reserve declarations are: Chromite at US$237 tonne and high-carbon ferrochrome HCFeCr at US$2,125 tonne of Cr: Manganese concentrate products between US$104 tonne and US$118 tonne, and iron manganese concentrate products at US$30 tonne: SSGPO iron ore at US 105 cents dmtu for concentrates, US 149 cents dmtu pellets, and US$345 tonne for HBI briquettes: Bamin Blast Furnace product at US$55 tonne, and US$68 tonne for direct reduction product, as per the Upside Assessment Report statement, dated 1 June 2011: Alumina at US$312 tonne: Coal from EEC at a weighted average between domestic and export of US$21 tonne: Coal from Shubarkol at a weighted average between export, domestic industrial and domestic heating at US$20 tonne: and Platinum price of US$1,700 ounce as at 30 June 2012 for Bokai.
SRK has relied on the Group and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to SRK is accurate.
A detailed information request list was submitted by SRK and the Group provided the data up to February 2013.
SRK independent expert mineral resource and ore reserves report for the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 170 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statements are based on the assumptions, assessments, recommendations and material changes as stated below.
Ferroalloys Division Kazchrome Donskoy GOK Chrome ore In 2012, Donskoy produced 4.5 Mt of run of mine ore. Molodezhnaya underground mine produced 2.5 Mt and has a mine life of 14 years, producing between 1.6 and 2.2 Mtpa for the next eight years.
The 10th Anniversary underground mine produced 1.9 Mt and has a mine life of 43 years, with an average 1.6 Mtpa from Phase 1 for the next 16 years.
The deeper Phase 2 commences production in 2020, with total production building up to around 4.0 Mtpa in 2035, continuing to 2055.
A significant portion of the Ore Reserves is dependent on successful application of new mining methods for both near surface and deposits at depth.
Whilst studies have been carried out for these, the methods have not been trialled and will be at a higher cost than the current method being utilised.
Due to the integrated structure of the Donskoy mines with the Aksu and Aktobe smelters, this higher mining cost will not negatively impact on the current Ore Reserve statement.
Yuzhny open pit mined a minimal 0.13 Mt in 2012 and is due to produce 2.3 Mt ore between 2013 and 2021, at a high stripping ratio.
The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves have decreased in line with depletion by 2012 production.
The investments required to sustain the current operations and to provide for planned expansions and improvements at the 10th Anniversary mine and the Aktobe smelter have been adequately allowed for.
Kazchrome Kazmarganets Manganese ore The Ore Reserves for Tur support production at current rates for 4.5 more years.
The current mining contract for Tur expires on 7 October 2021.
The Vostochny Kamys Ore Reserves are to be depleted in 2013.
The current mining contract for Vostochny Kamys expires on 28 June 2018.
Changes in the Mineral Resources and Ores Reserves are due to depletion, additional exploration, and reclassification of material for Tur, as reported on the GKZ balance.
Kazmarganets product is consumed by the Aksu smelter, and the Ore Reserves have therefore been stated on the basis that they are part of the integrated Kazchrome operations.
During 2012, the mines combined produced 1.1 Mt of manganese ore. Zhairemsky GOK Manganese and Iron-Manganese ores The Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves at Zhairemsky GOK have reduced by 1.7 Mt and 1.5 Mt respectively as a result of mining activities and stockpile depletion.
The majority of production has been sourced from the Ushkatyn III open pit manganese operations 1.1Mt, with additional manganese ore sourced from the Ushkatyn III underground mine 0.3 Mt and Zhomart open pit 0.3 Mt.
Minor iron-manganese ore mining has taken place during 2012 56 kt.
There have been no material changes to the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves for Zhairemsky GOK outside of mining depletion activities in 2012.
The current mining contract for Ushkatyn III expires in June 2015 and for Zhomart in June 2013.
The Ore Reserves for the Zhairemsky GOK deposits are based on a life-of-mine plan to the end of 2031.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that Zhairemsky GOK can extend these mining contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life-of-mine plans.
In addition to the manganese and iron-manganese Mineral Resources at Zhairemsky, polymetallic Mineral Resources have also been stated.
Of those, only the Zhumanai Barite Resource has been depleted by production over 2012.
SRK has been informed that changes are to be made to the GKZ Balance Reserves over 2013, which will affect the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve as currently reported.
Iron Ore Division SSGPO Iron ore In 2012, SSGPO produced 41.0 Mt of iron ore at 32.0% iron content, from four open pits and one underground mine.
The current mining contract expires in May 2015, and a Kazakhstan-based institute mining study has recently been undertaken to provide support to SSGPOs application for the 25-year extension to the mining contract up to 2040.
SSGPO has modified its life-of-mine plan, with the Institutes study as the basis up to 2040, and extended it up to 2050, depleting the GKZ industrial reserves.
SRK has based the Ore Reserve statement on SSGPOs mine plan up to 2050, but notes the following: This Ore Reserve statement assumes a second mining contract extension will be granted to enable operations beyond 2040: and SSGPO will need to provide additional technical design and economic modelling work to a similar level of detail as the Institute study for the material to be mined from 2040 to 2050.
Currently no Ore Reserves are stated for the Sorsky and Shagyrkulsky deposits, as no technical studies have been undertaken to prove either their technical feasibility or economic viability.
Our competitive Sustainable Financial review advantage Strategy in action development review Operational review and risk management Governance Financials ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 171 Bamin Iron ore The Statement for the Pedra fide Ferro PdF project is in line with the BFS Upside Assessment Report UAR Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statement as issued on 1 June 2011.
The Mineral Resources for PdF have been derived from those mineral rights licence areas that are attributable to Bamin as from this date, namely 870.830 2004, 870.283 2005, 811.466 1973, 292 1958, and 5247 1958.
At the planned annual production rate for the UAR of 19.5 Mt of product, the life of mine will be 16 years.
SRK notes that Bamin is currently undertaking studies for an alternative development plan for the PdF project.
This work is anticipated to be completed during 2013 and future Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve statements will be affected.
In addition to the Mineral Resources for PdF, Bamin also has reported Mineral Resources for Jurema Blocks 1 & 4, dated as at 9 January 2009.
Alumina and Aluminium Division AoK Bauxite In 2012, AoK produced a total of 5.2 Mt of bauxite: 4.8 Mt from nine operating open pits in three areas of KBRU and 0.4 Mt from four operating open pits at TBRU.
The TBRU mining contract expires on 21 January 2017, the mining contract for KBRUs Vostochno-Ayatskoye expires on 26 July 2031 and the mining contract for the remaining KBRU deposits Ayatskoye, Belinskoye and Krasnooktyabrskoye is valid until 21 January 2042.
SRK has declared the Ore Reserves on the understanding that AoK can extend these contracts under similar terms for periods that match their life-of-mine plans.
The Ore Reserves are based on an overall life-of-mine plan for AoK to the end of 2045 and are supported by the overall profitability of the Alumina and Aluminium Division, which includes the Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter, for which AoK is the sole alumina supplier.
Energy Division EEC Coal Vostochny Open Pit Coal Mine produced 20.3 Mt of coal in 2012.
The current mining contract expires on 18 March 2022.
The Coal Reserves are based on a life-of-mine plan up to 2046 and on the understanding that EEC can extend the contract under similar terms fora period that matches the life-of-mine plan.
The Resources can support operations continuing beyond 2046.
Shubarkol Coal During April 2012, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of ordinary shares of Shubarkol Komir JSC 25% having previously been acquired in February 2009.
The Shubarkol Open Pit Coal Mine produced 8.2 Mt of coal in 2012, from two contract areas: Centralny 5.5Mt, and Zapadny 2.7 Mt.
The Coal Reserve for Centralny is constrained by the mining contract boundary, with production ramping up to 15 Mtpa by 2020.
The mining contract boundary covers the area to be mined up to 2031.
The Coal Reserves for Zapadny have also been capped at 2031, based on the current position of the mining contract boundary associated with production of 5 Mtpa by 2020.
TheCoal Reserves are based on a life-of-mine plan up to 2031 but the Coal Resources can support operations far beyond 2031.
Other Non-ferrous Division Boss Mining and SMKK Copper Cobalt SRK has reviewed Mineral Resources for a variety of the Groups copper cobalt deposits located in the DRC, which the Group acquired through its majority shareholding in Central African Mining and Exploration Ltd CAMEC, now known as ENRC Africa Holdings Limited in 2009 and through the acquisition of SMKK in 2009 and 2010.
Resource models for the operating open pit mines at Mukondo Mountain and Kabolela both originally undertaken by international mining consultants, Coffey Mining have been depleted by production to 31 December 2012.
The resource model for the small operating open pit mine at Chimbedia, which was originally estimated by Deswik consultants, has been depleted by production to 31 December 2012.
Resources for the deposits at Saafi, Taratara, Kababankola, Luita Est, Disele Sud, Bangwe Est all part of the Kakanda permit and Kavundi Central part of the Menda permit were originally estimated by Deswik and have been restated as at 30 June 2012.
The Mineral Resource estimate for Kakanda was undertaken by AMEC consultants in 2012 and is dated 30 June 2012.
SRK has not stated any Ore Reserves for any of these deposits and current production is undertaken according to an internal mine plan.
SRK notes, that whilst mining takes place on the Mukondo Mountain, Chimbedia and Kabolela deposits, no reconciliation has been possible between the resource models presented and the mining production data.
This is considered a significant issue which will need to be resolved in the short term.
SRK notes, however, that AMEC has been commissioned by the Group to re-estimate all Deswik and Coffey resource models during 2013.
All Mineral Resources are presented on a 100% attributable basis.
SRK independent expert mineral resource and ore reserves report for the year ended 31 December 2012 continued 172 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Other Non-ferrous Division continued Comide Copper Cobalt In August 2010, the Group acquired 50.5% of the ordinary shares of Camrose Resources Limited Camrose which has a 55.3% indirect interest in Comide.
In December 2012, the Group completed the purchase of the remaining 49.5% of the outstanding ordinary shares of Camrose.
The deposits reviewed by SRK are: Shabulungu Est Extension, Kanika, Pungulume Est 1, 2, 3 and 4, Pungulume Principal, Mashitu Principal, Safwe Nord, and Mashitu Sud.
All of the estimates, apart from Mashitu Principal and Safwe Nord, were undertaken by SRK Consulting South Africa Pty Limited SRK SA during 2008 and 2009.
The Mineral Resource estimate for Mashitu Principal and Safwe Nord combined was undertaken by RSV Gem in January 2012.
SRK has restated the above estimates as at 30 June 2012, with the exception of Mashitu Principal, which is currently being mined by open pit methods, and hence the Mineral Resource statement has been depleted to 31 December 2012.
SRK notes that no reconciliation is possible between the Mashitu Principal Mineral Resource model and the mining production data.
This is considered to be a significant issue, which will need to be resolved in the short term.
As with Boss Mining, the Group has commissioned AMEC to re-estimate all the historical resource models, also incorporating up to date drilling results.
SRK has not stated any Ore Reserves for any of these deposits and current production at Mashitu Principal is undertaken according to an internal mine plan.
Roan Tailings Reclamation Project Copper Cobalt With the Groups acquisition of the remaining 49.5% in Camrose, it now owns an effective 70% in Metalkol, which holds the mineral licence for the Roan Tailings Reclamation RTR project in the DRC.
The RTR project is a project under development, which plans to establish a tailings retreatment copper-cobalt mine, processing reclaimed tailings from the Kolwezi metallurgical processing plant.
In March 2012, the Group acquired the access rights and surface infrastructure of the RTR project as part of the FQM transaction.
The Mineral Resource estimate is based on the original Resource estimate undertaken by Geostokos in 2003, with sufficient check calculations and, where appropriate, necessary adjustments made by SRK, and has been restated as at 30 June 2012.
Studies are ongoing with regards to mining, final plant construction and commissioning.
Frontier Copper In July 2012, the Group was granted a mining licence for the Frontier copper open pit mine in the DRC.
The existing surface infrastructure, for the previously FQM operated mine, was acquired as part of the FQM transaction in March 2012.
Mining by FQM ceased in August 2010.
The Group plans to recommission the operation in 2013.
The Mineral Resource has been authored by SRK as at 31 December 2012, based on wireframes provided by the Group and quality control and quality assurance data collated by AMEC.
Drilling is ongoing, and the Mineral Resource estimate is therefore likely to change in the near future.
SRK understands that technical studies are ongoing.
SRK has not stated any Ore Reserves for the Frontier deposit.
Bokai Platinum The Bokai platinum project in Zimbabwe is managed and operated by Todal, which is a 60% subsidiary of the Group.
The remaining 40% is owned by Transminerals Corporation.
The Groups interest in the project was acquired as part of the CAMEC transaction.
A feasibility study was completed on the Bokai platinum project in June 2011, which SRK has reviewed.
SRK has restated the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves as at 30 June 2012.
At the planned annual production rate of 3.6 Mtpa of ore 146 koz of platinum per annum, the life of mine will be 19 years.
Whilst full approval for the project has not been granted, Todal has commenced construction of the decline system.

AMEC independent expert ore reserves report for the year ended 31 December 2012 184 ENRC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 AMEC Australia has been engaged to benchmark current planning practice, identify gaps and assist with the improvement in the resource to reserve conversion process.
The reporting of reserves in 2012 is therefore the start of a process that will convert the Mineral Resources published into Ore Reserves over the next two years.
The current Ore Reserves have been prepared by the Group ENRC PLC and each of its subsidiaries and audited by AMEC Australia in accordance with the JORC Code 2004.
The Ore Reserve estimates have been prepared on the basis of Mineral Resource estimates that have been prepared or audited by SRK in January 2013, with the exception of the Frontier Mineral Resource.
AMEC understands that the Mineral Resource estimate has been audited by SRK in 2007 as part of the FQM listing documentation.
This 2007 audited Mineral Resource model was used for the Ore Reserve estimation.
Subsequently the Mineral Resources have been re-estimated by SRK in January 2013 incorporating additional information.
This has led to a substantial increase and re-classification of the mineral resources.
In October 2012, AMEC visited the Groups DRC copper and cobalt operations and AMEC audited the Ore Reserve estimates carried out by the Group or its consultants.
AMEC has relied on the Group and its technical representatives to ensure all technical information provided to AMEC is accurate.
The Group provided the data for review to AMEC during January and February 2013.
AMEC reviewed the Ore Reserve estimates in conjunction with the Groups price forecast for copper and cobalt.
Boss Mining SMKK The Group owns 70% of Boss Mining with the remaining 30% owned by Gcamines.
The Boss Mining operations comprise the active Mukondo Mountain and Chimbedia open pits, the KDC cobalt dense media separation and flotation plant and the Luita heap leach and electro-winning plant.
The Group owns 100% of SMKK and its operations comprise Kabolela South, an active open pit mine.
The Groups production plans for the currently active pits extend until June 2014 for Kabolela South, and August 2014 for Mukondo Mountain.
Due to the campaign processing of ore mined from the two pits through the concentrator, processing will continue until December 2014.
However, there is no life-of-mine plan for the Mukondo Mountain pit, which is based on the audited and signed SRK Mineral Resource.
AMEC understands that there is no major capital investment required for Mukondo Mountain, and as such is of the opinion that the Ore Reserve estimates are sufficient to demonstrate the economic viability of Probable Ore Reserves.
There is a life-ofmine plan for the Kabolela pit, which is based on the audited and signed SRK Mineral Resource as per 31 December 2012.
Comide For the year 2012, Comide reported a production of 717 kt dry tonnes copper ore grading 2.48% Cu between March and December 2012.
The Mashitu Principal pit life-of-mine plan forecasts production until December 2015.
However, there is no life-of-mine plan for the Mashitu Principal pit, which is based on the audited SRK Mineral Resource estimate as per 31 December 2012.
As there is no major capital investment required for Mashitu Principal from 2013 onwards, AMEC is of the opinion that the Ore Reserve estimates are sufficient to demonstrate the economic viability of Probable Ore Reserves.
Frontier There was no production at Frontier in 2012, as the concentrator is being re-commissioned and upgraded.
The emphasis of the mining operation has been on pre-stripping, rather than the increase of ore inventory on the run of mine pad.
The Frontier mine is a long life asset as the current life-of-mine plan extends until 2024.
At this time the life-of-mine plan is still based on the Mineral Resource estimate reviewed by SRK in 2007, as there was not enough time to develop an updated life-of-mine plan based on the Mineral Resource estimate carried out by SRK in 2013.
Concluding Remarks AMEC considers that the production levels and respective operating costs planned for the Groups copper and cobalt operations in the DRC to be realistic.
The required mine infrastructure is in place for the realisation of the current life-of-mine plans.
Based on AMECs high level review, AMEC believes that the stated Ore Reserves are fair and reasonable.
AMEC notes that with the exception of the Frontier pit, the producing open pit mines have short mine lives.
To sustain current production levels over longer periods, the Group needs to engage in an aggressive mine development programme.
AMEC understands that the Group has taken initial steps to replace the existing mining capacity and to expand production.
