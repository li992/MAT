When derivative transactions are undertaken with bank counterparties, the group may, where appropriate, enter into certain agreements with such bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral for the benefit of the other if the net valuations of the derivatives are above a pre-determined threshold.
At 30 June 2012, the collateral held under these agreements amounted to $135 million 86 million and 54 million 44 million 2011 $84 million 52 million and 44 million 39 million.
The interest rates shown in the table above are those contracted on the underlying borrowings before taking into account any interest rate hedges see note 23.
The average monthly net borrowings for the year were 8,293 million 2011 7,227 million.
Based on average monthly net borrowings and net interest charge, taking into account interest rate hedges, the effective interest rate for the year was 4.7% 2011 4.9%.
For this calculation, net interest charge excludes fair value adjustments to derivative financial instruments and borrowings and average monthly net borrowings include the impact of interest rate swaps that are no longer in a hedge relationship but exclude the market value adjustment for cross currency interest rate swaps.
The loans above are stated net of unamortised finance costs of 92 million 2011 78 million: 2010 84 million.
The weighted average interest rate, before interest rate hedges, for short term borrowings at 30 June 2012 was 6.1% 2011 4.3%: 2010 5.6%.
The weighted average interest rate, before interest rate hedges, for bonds, medium term notes and bank loans included within borrowings due after one year at 30 June 2012 was 5.1% 2011 5.8%: 2010 5.5%.
Certain borrowings are reported in the table above at amortised cost with a fair value adjustment shown separately.
