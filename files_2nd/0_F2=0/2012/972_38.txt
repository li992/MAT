Unless stated otherwise tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes.
Estimates of Diamond Reserve tonnes re ect the tonnage to be treated.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Snap Lake: Due to the high costs associated with resource development, Indicated Resources are continuously developed from underground infrastructure ahead of the mining face, resulting in an 18 month rolling reserve.
