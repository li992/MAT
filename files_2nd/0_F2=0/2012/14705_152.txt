As stated in the Groups accounting policies the directors review the carrying amounts of the Groups tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to these assets.
Indicators of impairment exist for certain of the freehold properties held within the Groups associate.
Accordingly an impairment review has been performed in accordance with the above policy.
Value in use calculations have been prepared based on 5 year management forecasts with a terminal growth rate of 2% applied thereafter, representing managements estimate of the long-term growth rate of the sector served by these assets.
These cash ows have been discounted at a risk adjusted pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of 11.9%.
No impairment charge has been recognised as a result of the review performed.
