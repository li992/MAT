Share-based payments The following disclosures relate to share option and SAYE grants made after 7 November 2002.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
"The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2012 2011 Executive Nil price Nil price options SAYE options SAYE options Share price at grant date pence - Group 912 1,114 1,062 833 975 Option exercise price pence - Group 806 818 - 657 - Share price at grant date pence - Company 912 1,114 1,062 833 975 Option exercise price pence - Company 806 818 - 657 - KdaVi a in gdje VcY 8dbeVcn 53.0% 38.4% 40.9% 48.6% 61.4% Dei dc a [Z nZVgh gdje VcY 8dbeVcn 3.0 3.3 3.0 3.5 3.0 G h`""[gZZ ciZgZhi gViZ gdje VcY 8dbeVcn 1.0% 0.4% 0.5% 0.9% 1.7% :meZXiZY Y k YZcYh Vh V Y k YZcY n ZaY Group and Company 1.7% 2.3% 2.3% 1.8% 1.9% Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period equal to the vesting period."
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of three times.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
