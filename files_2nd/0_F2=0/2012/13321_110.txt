As a substantial proportion of profits are generated outside the UK, the standard rate of tax has been determined as the weighted average of the standard rates of tax in each of the different countries where profits are generated.
The relevant rates were approximately 28% 2011: 29%.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax at 31 December 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
