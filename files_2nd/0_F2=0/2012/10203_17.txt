Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 1 Segmental reporting In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the Group has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker the Executive Committee.
Operating segments are consistent with those used in internal management reporting and the measure used by the Executive Committee is the Adjusted EBITDA for the Group as a whole as set out in note 4.
In the year ended 30 April 2011 resources were managed on a global basis and accordingly the Executive Committee did not measure costs or operating profi t by segment and therefore the Group has not reported operating profi t by segment for the year ended 30 April 2011.
Effective from 1 May 2011, the Group has reduced its number of operating segments to the three geographic regions with the Borland business now integrated within the regional organisations.

The release resulted mainly from lower settlements paid to staff made redundant by the restructuring, from our ability to avoid repaying a grant and settlement of property lease liabilities at lower levels than originally expected.
Prior year restructuring costs of $14.5m relate to the Group restructuring that took place in March and April 2011.
Salaries and severance costs were $17.1m, facilities costs were $3.8m and other costs were $1.2m.
These were offset by net releases of onerous lease provisions in the year of $7.6m.
Severance costs included within reorganisation costs are not included within staff costs disclosed in note 29.
Services provided by the Groups auditors and network of fi rms During the year the Group obtained the following services from the Groups auditor as detailed below: 2012 2011 $000 $000 Audit services Fees payable to the Companys auditor for the audit of the parent Company and consolidated accounts 113 86 Other services Fees payable to the Companys auditor and their associates for other services: The audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 682 684 Services related to taxation 83 72 Other services 330 Total 1,208 842 The Groups auditors,  LLP, provide non-audit services for the Group over and above the external audit, principally tax compliance, tax advice and due diligence work.

The adjustments in respect of prior year to current tax of $6.6m and deferred tax of $3.1m are comprised of a number of small items the most signifi cant of which include the release of provisions based on prior best estimates which are no longer required.
The tax for the year is lower 2011: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 25.8% 2011: 27.8%.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 26% to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012: as this reduction was substantively enacted by the balance sheet date it is refl ected in the annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2012.
Accordingly the Companys profi ts for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 25.8% and will be taxed at 24% in the future.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 51 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 continued 6 Taxation continued In addition to the changes in rates of Corporation tax disclosed above a number of further changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2012.
A further reduction to the main rate is proposed to reduce the rate by 1% to 22% by 1 April 2014.
Neither of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in this annual report and accounts.
It is expected that the effects of these changes will have an immaterial impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities currently recognised.

Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 52 2012 overview IFC Management and governance 16 Company fi financial statements and notes 70 Business review 02 Consolidated fi financial statements and notes 37 Additional information 80 9 Goodwill 2012 2011 $000 $000 Cost and net book amount At 1 May 274,355 274,355 Acquisitions Adjustment relating to prior years Exchange adjustments 15 At 30 April 274,340 274,355 A segment-level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below: North America 215,056 215,056 International 55,860 55,860 Asia Pacifi c 3,439 3,439 Exchange adjustments 15 At 30 April 274,340 274,355 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU.
The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has three CGUs being the three geographical segments North America: International and Asia Pacifi c. The North American legal entities acquired the equity of the Borland Group and the assets of the ASQ division of Compuware.
Therefore, AMQ has now been allocated to the North American region.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future fi financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following fi financial year forms the basis for the cash fl ow projections for a CGU.
The cash fl ow projections in the three fi financial years following the budget year refl ect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash fl ows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that refl ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and risks specifi c to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2012 2011 North America 17.0% 16.7% International 13.9% 14.1% Asia Pacifi c 15.5% 15.2% Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 40.0% 2011: 40.0%.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 53 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 continued 9 Goodwill continued Long-term growth rates of net operating cash fl ows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash fl ows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2.0% 2011: 2.0%.
The long-term growth rate is applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs: and The Group has announced an intention to increase net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio from 0.6 times at 30 April 2012 to 1.5 times by 30 April 2014.
During the twelve months to 30 April 2013 all CGUs will be impacted as the Group changes its net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2011: nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating mode, the directors are of the opinion that it would take a systematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% 2011: 4.0% in the absolute value of long-term operating margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is fl exible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more signifi cant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% 2011: 4.0% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2011: 2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this would represent a 12.0% 2011: 15.0% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash fl ows of all CGUs were 2.0% 2011: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a 1.0% 2011: 1.0% change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUS combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past Adjusted EBITDA margins are not indicative of future Adjusted EBITDA margins.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 40.0% 2011: 40.0%.
The medium-term growth rates of net operating cash fl ows are assumed to be 4.0% for each CGU 2011: 4.0%.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see accounting policy IH d. At 30 April 2012, the unamortised lives of technology assets were in the range of three to seven years and for customer relationships in the range of two to eight years.
Amortisation of $7.3m 2011: $7.3m is included in selling and distribution costs, $24.6m 2011: $20.9m is included in research and development expense and $0.9m 2011: $1.1m is included in administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation of $0.3m 2011: $0.2m is included within selling and distribution costs and $3.5m 2011: $4.5m is included within administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2012 and 2011, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2012, trade receivables of $12.9m 2011: $15.9m were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 33 days in excess of due date 2011: 42 days.
As at 30 April 2012, trade receivables of $2.8m 2011: $4.4m were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $2.8m 2011: $4.4m.
The ageing of these receivables is as follows: 2012 2011 $000 $000 Three to four months 152 381 Over four months 2,605 4,035 Total 2,757 4,416 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2012 2011 $000 $000 At 1 May 4,416 2,225 Provision for receivables impairment 959 2,324 Receivables written off as uncollectable 2,501 316 Exchange adjustments 117 183 At 30 April 2,757 4,416 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in both selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Amounts charged in the allowance account are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

The credit of $7.6m which was offset against the $22.1m of restructuring costs in the year ended 30 April 2011 is included in the $12.3m of releases in onerous leases and dilapidations.
Restructuring provisions relates to the restructuring and property rationalization that was undertaken during the year ended 30 April 2011.
Included within this is $0.3m of legal costs associated with the restructuring, $0.5m for redundancy and $1.6m for property costs incurred as part of the restructuring.
The provision is expected to be fully utilised within twelve months.
Other provisions include $0.1m of costs relating to a rationalization of non-trading subsidiaries and $3.9m relating to our subsidiary in Brazil.
Of this $3.1m relates to taxes potentially due for pensions and bonus payments between July 2006 and July 2011, $0.3m for potential claims from third party contractors for unpaid benefi ts in prior years and $0.6m for potential claims from other third parties.
The timing of these provisions is uncertain but it is expected to be over twelve months before the provisions are fully utilised.
In prior periods provisions totalling $24.9m for the year ended 30 April 2011 and $16.1m for the year ended 30 April 2010 had been included within accruals.
However, following a review it has been determined that it is more appropriate to show these balances as provisions in accordance with IAS 37, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Micro Focus International plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 59 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2012 continued 21 Financial instruments Credit risk The carrying amount of fi financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 30 April 2012 was: 2012 2011 $000 $000 Trade and other receivables 81,278 93,801 Cash and cash equivalents 30,410 26,080 Total 111,688 119,881 Risk management The Groups treasury function aims to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other fi financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available as and when required, and to invest cash assets safely and profi tably.
The Group does not typically engage in speculative trading in fi financial instruments.
The treasury functions policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored by the audit committee and are subject to internal audit review.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as well as gains and losses on consolidation which go to reserves.
Such exposures refl ect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
Note 3 shows the impact of foreign exchange gains in the year.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups principal exposures in relation to market risks are the changes in the exchange rates between the US dollar and the Euro and to changes in US LIBOR interest rates.
The table below illustrates the sensitivities of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only fi financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date.

The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long-term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium-term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The Groups committed credit facilities contain two principal fi financial covenants.
The Group has complied with these covenant requirements to the year ended 30 April 2012.
During the year the Group increased its credit facilities to $275m from $215m and carried out a return of value to its shareholders which resulted in $129.6m of cash being returned to shareholders see note 25.
Further details on the covenant requirements and Group performance against these can be found on page 4 of the Business Review.

Share Purchase and Option Plan 2001 The Group had a share based compensation plan the Plan under which employees and directors could be granted options to purchase the Companys ordinary shares.
On the full listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange the options were treated as having vested and were exchanged for three options in the ordinary shares of the newly listed entity.
At this date the Plan was closed for new issues.
No options were granted under the Plan during the year.
Options over ordinary shares held by employees under the Plan, all of which were exercisable, were as follows: 2012 2011 ||||| Weighted Weighted average average exercise price exercise price Options pence Options pence Outstanding at 1 May 120,817 8p Exercised 97,192 9p Forfeited 23,625 6p Outstanding at 30 April Exercisable at 30 April As at 30 April 2011 and 30 April 2012 none of these options were outstanding.
The weighted average share price for options exercised in the year was nil p 2011: 376p.
No amount was charged through the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 2011: nil.
Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The total number of options they receive is determined by the performance criteria set by the remuneration committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which point 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight-line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period or a combination of cumulative EPS growth and ASR.
For the latter, the cumulative EPS growth over a three year period must be at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum at which 25% of awards will vest and full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 9% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
The resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report.
