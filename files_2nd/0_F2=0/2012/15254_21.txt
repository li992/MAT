Overview Business review Governance Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the period ended 1 April 2012 1 General information Synergy Health plc the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group deliver a range of specialist outsourced services to healthcare providers and other customers concerned with health management.
The Company is registered in the United Kingdom under company registration number 3355631 and its registered office is Ground Floor Stella, Windmill Hill Business Park, Whitehill Way, Swindon, Wilts SN5 6NX.
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These are presented on pages 84 to 91.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to the nearest weekend to 31 March each year.
The current accounting period is 52 weeks in length 2011: 53 weeks in length.
Basis of consolidation Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly-controlled entities are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, with items of a similar nature on a line-by-line basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies set out below.
Going concern In adopting the going concern basis for preparing the financial statements, the Directors have considered the Groups business activities as set out in the Strategic review and Regional review, the financial position of the Group and its cash flows and borrowing requirements, as set out in the Finance Directors review, and the principal risks and uncertainties as set out on pages 23 to 25.
Based on the Groups cash flow forecasts and projections, the Board is satisfied that the Group will be able to operate within the level of its facilities for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Business combinations The Group applies IFRS 3 Business combinations revised in accounting for business combinations.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value allocations are reviewed and if necessary adjusted no later than one year from the acquisition date.
Costs that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of services but sometimes goods are also supplied, usually as part of a service offering.
Revenue is recognised once the service has been completed and the Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer.
The Group does not participate in activities which need to be accounted for under long term contract accounting rules.
Non-recurring items Non-recurring income and expenses are those items that are one-off in nature and create significant volatility in reported earnings and are therefore reported separately in the income statement.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and presented in the Statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 51 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Finance charges and income Interest charges and income are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Financing transaction costs that relate to financial liabilities are charged to interest expense by reference to the effective interest rate method and are recognised within the carrying value of the related financial liability on the balance sheet.
Fees paid for the arrangement of credit facilities are recognised through the finance expense over the term of the facility.
Where assets or liabilities on the Group balance sheet are carried at net present value, the increase in the amount due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance expense or finance income as appropriate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not recognised on taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill or for temporary differences arising from the initial recognition of assets and liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Dividends Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Groups shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved and paid.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are initially capitalised at fair value as at the date of the acquisition, and subsequently stated at carrying value less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer-related intangibles 515 years Trade names 10 years Costs incurred in setting up long term agreements are capitalised as intangible assets and amortised over the life of the contract to which the costs relate.
Technology licences are amortised from the date that they generate economic benefit and over the period of that benefit.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings The Groups policy is not to revalue property for accounting purposes.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of tangible non-current assets excluding cobalt, less estimated residual values, over their estimated useful lives in equal annual instalments as follows: Freehold land Not depreciated Plant and machinery 320 years Freehold property 50 years Office equipment 35 years Leasehold improvements Period of lease Cobalt 15 years Assets in the course on construction Not depreciated Circulating inventory 15 years 52 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial Statements 2 Accounting policies continued Cobalt is depreciated over 15 years as follows.
The reducing balance is used for the first eight years, then the residual net book value is depreciated on a straight-line basis over seven years.
Potential decommissioning costs are capitalised and amortised over 15 years on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding provision is recognised in the balance sheet on acquisition.
Circulating inventory mainly comprises linen textile assets provided to customers on a rental service basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Assets held under leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under hire purchase contracts are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment in value is recognised in the income statement.
Investment property Investment properties are properties land and buildings which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Investment properties are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the buildings over 50 years.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are non-derivative financial assets which arise when the Group provides goods or services directly to a third party, and where there is no intention of trading the financial asset.
The receivables are initially recognised at fair value.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Provision against trade receivables is made when objective evidence is received that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due to it in accordance with the original terms of those receivables.
The amount of the write down is determined as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are netted off against cash.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 53 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Accounting policies continued Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at fair value, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Some of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows or against net investment in overseas subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not clearly related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statement of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement.
In order to manage its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see above for the details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 3 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value of each award is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
The level of vesting is reviewed annually: the charge is adjusted to reflect actual and estimated levels of vesting.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model, except for the Long Term Incentive Plan awards which are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance condition where a model following similar principles to the Monte Carlo approach is used.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
54 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial Statements 2 Accounting policies continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Where estimates and associated assumptions are made they are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Key areas of estimate uncertainty are set out below.
In relation to the Groups cobalt provision, costs of future disposal are based on contractual arrangements with third parties and latest disposal cost estimates.
The Group cobalt depreciation policy is based on the actual physical decay of the cobalt 60 isotope.
In relation to the Groups property, plant and equipment note 13, useful economic lives and residual values of assets have been established using historical experience and an assessment of the nature of the assets involved.
Impairment tests have been undertaken with respect to goodwill note 11 using commercial judgement and a number of assumptions and estimates have been made to support their carrying amounts.
In relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, actuarial assumptions are established using relevant market benchmark data and with the advice of external qualified actuaries.
Customer related intangibles that are acquired as part of an acquisition are valued based on the forecast discounted cash flows arising from these customers taking account of historically observed customer attrition rates The Group operates in a number of countries, all of which have their own tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the current tax rate which may not be the tax rate at which they unwind.
The Group has available tax losses, some of which have been recognised and some of which have not, based upon managements best estimates of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses.
Adoption of new standards: The following new standards, amendments to standards or interpretations must be applied for the first time by the Group for the period ending 1 April 2012 but are not currently relevant: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of IFRSs.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures revised 2009.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement.
In addition to the above, amendments to a number of standards under the annual improvements project to IFRS, which are mandatory for the period ending 1 April 2012, have been adopted in the year.
None of these amendments has had a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
The following standard has been published, endorsed by the EU, and is available for early adoption but has not yet been applied by the Group in these financial statements: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures amendments regards transfers of financial assets.
Management is currently assessing the impact of these amendments on the financial statements: they are not expected to impact the Group significantly.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 55 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Segmental information The Group is organised into four operating segments, and information on these segments is reported to the chief operating decision maker CODM for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
The CODM has been identified as the Board of Directors.
The four operating segments are: the UK & Ireland, Europe & Middle East, Asia & Africa, and the Americas.
The segments derive their revenues from the same range of products and services being the provision of Healthcare Services, Applied Sterilisation Services formerly termed Medical Device Sterilisation Services, and Hospital Sterilisation Services.
The CODM monitors the performance of the operating segments based on adjusted operating profit, being operating profit excluding the impact of amortisation on acquired intangibles and non-recurring items.
The Americas segment has been created in the period by the acquisition of MSI and BeamOne see note 24a and 24d : as a consequence, US revenues and profit disclosed within Asia in the prior year figure have been restated.

These costs relate primarily to the acquisition of four businesses: BeamOne, Sterilgamma, LSH, and MSI.
These acquisitions are disclosed in more detail in notes 24a to 24d.
Included in this charge is a loss of 70,000 recognised on the disposal of a subsidiary undertaking in July 2011.
The discontinued activity relating to this disposal has been included in the income statement.
The table below provides further details: 2012 2011 000 000 Turnover 1,025 6,950 Operating profit 3 359 During the period the Group incurred costs in restructuring its Healthcare Solutions business in the UK and Europe.
These costs related mainly to employee termination payments and property costs.
As detailed in note 24d, the Group has a liability in respect of deferred contingent consideration of BeamOne.
Based on BeamOnes performance for the year, the amount of such consideration to be paid is in excess of that recognised at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations, this increase has been recognised in the income statement.
The total impact of non-recurring items on profit after tax is a charge of 3,393,000.
Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 57 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 4 Profit before tax continued In the prior year, non-recurring items of 3,278,000 were credited in arriving at operating profit.

These costs related primarily to the acquisition of GSP in late 2010 and BeamOne, which completed early in the current year.
These acquisitions are disclosed in more detail in notes 24e and 24d respectively.
During the prior year the Group received a summary court judgement in our favour relating to an insurance claim arising from a fire at our Dunstable facility in early 2007.
The non-recurring gain of 4,167,000 reflects the recognition of insurance proceeds received, less costs associated with the claim and final additional costs of working not previously written down.
In addition to the above a non-recurring credit of 1,446,000 in respect of court awarded interest on the Dunstable insurance case was recognised in finance income.
The total impact of non-recurring items to profit after tax in the prior year was a credit of 3,153,000.

Taxation for overseas operations is calculated at the local prevailing rates.
On 23 March 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
This change was enacted on 26 March 2012 under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
The effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred tax liability which has been included in the figures above.
On 23 March 2012, the Chancellor of the Exchequer also announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% for the year starting 1 April 2013.
It is expected that this change will be substantially enacted in June or July 2012.
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit before tax per the income statement as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Profit before tax 32,477 36,733 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 26% 2011: 28% 8,444 10,285 Effect of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 380 866 Different tax rates on overseas earnings 631 1,096 Overseas withholding tax 231 Adjustment in respect of prior years 294 2,090 Effect of change in UK corporation tax rate 474 633 Previously unrecognised unused tax losses 602 Tax charge for year 7,656 7,934 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 59 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 9 Dividends 2012 2011 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the period: Final dividend for the year ended 3 April 2011 of 9.84p per share 5,432 Second interim dividend for the year ended 28 March 2010 of 8.3p per share 4,540 Interim dividend for the period ended 1 April 2012 of 6.82p 2011: 6.0p per share 3,774 3,298 9,206 7,838 The Board of Directors will recommend to the shareholders a final dividend for the period ended 1 April 2012 of 11.18p 2011: 9.84p.

An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value, of the assets of a CGU, to their recoverable amount based on a value in use calculation.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year the goodwill for each CGU was separately assessed and tested for impairment, with nil 2011: nil impairment charges resulting.
As part of testing goodwill for impairment, detailed forecasts of operating cash flows for a period of five years are derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management.
Cash flows for the period beyond the financial forecasts are extrapolated based on estimates of future growth rates as disclosed above.
For each CGU the future growth rates used in the recoverable amount calculation do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the markets to which the CGU is dedicated.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The discount rates applied to each specific CGU are set out in the table above.
A number of key assumptions are used as part of impairment testing.
These key assumptions are made by management reflecting past experience combined with their knowledge as to future performance and relevant external sources of information.
In determining the recoverable amount of each CGU the key assumptions are discount rate, long term growth rate, future sales prices and volumes, new business won and the cost structure of each business.
Sensitivity analysis as at 1 April 2012 has indicated that no reasonable foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model will result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.
Other intangibles includes capitalised software.
The Group has land and buildings a carrying value of 7.2 million pledged to secure banking facilities and other loans granted to the Group 2011: 13.9 million.
At 1 April 2012, the Group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to 7.0 million 2011: 8.0 million.
Included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is 805,000 2011: 805,000 of capitalised interest.

The new Revolving Credit Facilities were used to refinance the Groups previous syndicated loan facility of 160 million, which had been due for repayment on 15 January 2012.
The new Revolving Credit Facilities comprise one facility of 105 million, and a second facility of 130 million.
Both Facilities are unsecured and attract a floating rate of interest, although fixing arrangements have been entered into as described in note 19.
Certain Euro-denominated loans outside the main facilities totalling 3.3 million are secured by mortgages on certain Dutch freehold properties.
The loans attract both floating and fixed rates of interest.
At 1 April 2011, the Group had available 31.2 million of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
In addition, the Group had undrawn overdraft and other uncommitted facilities totalling 12.2 million which it expects to renew during the financial year.

19 Financial instruments Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method, with the exception of contingent consideration which is measured by a Level 3 valuation method.
Under reasonably possible alternative valuation assumptions, the fair value of the BeamOne contingent consideration could increase or decrease by 725,000.
The quantum of the LSH deferred contingent consideration will be determined by the extent to which a specific non-operating tax asset held by the acquired business is recovered.
Overall, the Group is not exposed to any financial risk on this item.
a Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
b Interest rate risk The Group is subject to fluctuations in interest rates on its loans and surplus cash deposits.
At 1 April 2012 the Group held hedging arrangements in order to fix the interest charge on $35.0 million of its bank debt.
The swap arrangements cover: Debt covered Millions Fixed rate Expiry $35.0 2.50% March 2016 Amounts to be paid or received under these arrangements will be recognised in the interest expense consistent with the terms of the agreement.
The expiry of each agreement is disclosed in the table above.
The arrangements are fully effective in fixing the interest on the underlying debt.
In revaluing them to fair value, the Group has recognised 1,350,000 2011: 85,000 in current liabilities and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonable possible change in interest rates on the element of the total Group interest which is not subject to fixed interest arrangements.
The reasonable change is based on the difference between current market interest rates and one year forward rates: Increase decrease Effect on profit after tax and equity in basis points 000 2012 49 49 611 611 2011 97 97 874 874 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 67 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Financial instruments continued c Foreign currency risk Whilst the exposure is limited, the Groups principal currency exposure is to fluctuations in the exchange rate between Sterling and the Euro.
The Groups policy is to ensure that the proportion of interest cost in each currency is consistent with the proportion of earnings in that currency.
By arranging its affairs in this manner, the Group seeks to ensure that there is no disproportionate impact on its results as a result of exchange rate movements.
During the 12 months to March 2012 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro weakened by 1% in comparison to the 12 month average to March 2011.
A 1% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro over the entire year to March 2012 would have resulted in increased adjusted operating profit of 0.2 million 2011: a 4% strengthening, which would have led to a decrease of 1.0 million.
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 1% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the Euro would have an equal but opposite effect.
Where the Group subsidiaries make significant purchases in non-functional currencies, such as US and Canadian Dollars, the Group enters into forward exchange currency contracts to manage this exposure.
During the 12 months to March 2012 the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar has strengthened by 3% in comparison to the 12 months average to March 2011.
A 3% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar over the entire year to March 2012 would have resulted in reduced adjusted operating profit of 0.1 million 2011: a 3% weakening, which would have led to a increase of 0.1 million.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
A 3% strengthening in the average exchange rate for Sterling against the US Dollar would have an equal but opposite effect.
Currency derivatives: The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows in foreign currencies and is a party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in the functional currencies of the Groups trading entities and its suppliers.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the underlying hedged item until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
Additionally, the Group holds net Euroand US Dollardenominated loans in UK companies totalling 59.0 million and 12.4 million 2011: 70.4 million and nil.
This represents a fully effective designated net investment hedge against the first 59.0 million of the Groups Eurodenominated net assets of 112.3 million and 12.4 million of the Groups US Dollar-denominated net assets of 37.4 million 2011: 70.4 million and nil.
The revaluation of these loans resulted in a gain of 3.1 million 2011: loss of 2.2 million which has been posted to the translation reserve.
d Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for impairment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
Management has credit policies in place to manage risk and to monitor exposure to risk on an ongoing basis.
These include the use of customer specific credit limits based on third party credit reports and in cases of customer default or requests for credit above agreed limits the use of pro forma invoices to secure payment in advance of delivery.
Given these factors and based on extensive past experience, the Group believes that its financial assets are of good credit quality.
Exposure to credit risk: The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
Therefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was 71,519,000 2011: 83,688,000 being the total trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet.
This figure is lower than last year as a result of cash drawn down before the 2011 year end to fund the acquisition of BeamOne.
The Groups customer base mainly comprises major medical device companies, commercial distributors, NHS Trusts and healthcare providers, including public sector, private sector and charitable organisations, throughout the world.
No single customer or top 10 customer grouping accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables.
The Group has in place an insurance policy to cover the majority of its Healthcare solutions UK export customers.
Credit quality of trade receivables and impairment losses At the balance sheet date, the ageing of trade receivables was: 2012 2011 Gross Gross Group 000 000 Current 34,045 33,110 130 days overdue 8,780 7,740 3160 days overdue 1,834 1,290 6190 days overdue 1,450 573 More than 90 days overdue 310 287 46,419 43,000 68 Synergy Health plc Annual Report & Financial Statements 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial Statements 19 Financial instruments continued Financial assets are reviewed for impairment at the balance sheet date and a full provision for impairment is made against trade receivables that are not considered to be recoverable.
The total provision against trade receivables at the period end was 947,000 2011: 418,000.
No further analysis has been provided for cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables from Group companies, other trade receivables and other financial assets as there is limited exposure to credit risk and no provisions for impairment have been recognised.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Details of the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities are given in note 18.
Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are: i. to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders, and ii.
to provide an adequate return to shareholders by a pricing products and services commensurate with the level of risk and b ensuring returns on new investment programmes will maintain or increase shareholder returns.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares, if required.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the periods ended 1 April 2012 and 3 April 2011.
The table below presents the quantitative data for the components the Group manages as capital: 2012 2011 000 000 Shareholders funds 290,831 288,592 Finance leases 9,616 7,862 Bank loans 183,792 141,579 Other interest-bearing loans 2,041 1,662 486,280 439,695 20 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where appropriate.
On 23 March 2012, the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 24% with effect from 1 April 2012.
The change was enacted on 26 March 2012 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction creates a reduction in the deferred tax liability which has been included in the figures included above.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 22% by 1 April 2014, but these changes have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are not included in the figures above.

In accordance with IFRS 3 revised Business Combinations, the amount of consideration due to be paid has been estimated at the balance sheet date.
The movement in this estimate from the date of acquisition has been recognised in non-recurring items within the income statement.
The acquisition gave rise to goodwill of 14.4 million.
This is 1.4 million higher than the goodwill disclosed within our 2011 interim statements, due to two factors: a 3.1 million increase to our calculation of fair value ascribed to customer relationship intangible assets, and a 4.5 million increase to total consideration due to the incorrect inclusion of Florida EtO start-up costs within the estimate of deferred consideration payable.

In the event that there is an under-funding position the trustees of the scheme can take a range of actions including increasing employee contributions and reducing member benefits as well as asking employers to increase their contributions.
It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets, liabilities, and overall surplus deficit of the plan attributable to the business, because the plan is industry-wide.
However, to the extent that a surplus or deficit in the plan may affect the amount of future contributions, the Company will be required to recognise its share of these obligations.
Under the specific exemptions within IAS 19, the scheme is therefore treated as a defined contribution scheme within the Group financial statements.
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of this scheme was 2,344,000 2011: 2,482,000.
