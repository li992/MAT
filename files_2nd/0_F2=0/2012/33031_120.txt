Financial instruments and financial risk factors continued Current finance debt on the group balance sheet at 31 December 2012 includes $632 million 2011 $30 million in respect of cash deposits received for disposals expected to complete in 2013, which will be considered extinguished on completion of the transactions.
This amount is excluded from the table below.
The table also shows the timing of cash outflows relating to trade and other payables and accruals.
The group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturitiesof both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 33.
Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows that could be of a significantly different amount, or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.
The table below shows cash outflows for derivative hedging instruments based upon contractual payment dates.
The amounts reflect the maturity profile of the fair value liability where the instruments will be settled net, and the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency interest rate swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt.
The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement day risk exposure is considered to be negligible.
Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $8,620 million at 31 December 2012 2011 $9,099 million to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.
Also not shown are the expected cash outflows under the Rosneft share purchase agreements described in Note 33, nor the related expected cash inflows for the sale of our 50% interest in TNK-BP.
These amounts represent the maximum exposure of the group, substantially all of which could be called within one year.
