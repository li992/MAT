2.5 | Reserves and resources The reserves and resources data in the following tables is presented on a 100% asset basis, unless otherwise stated.
All tonnage and volume information has been rounded to reflect the relative uncertainty in the estimates: there may therefore be small differences in the totals.
The Measured and Indicated Mineral and Coal Resources are reported inclusive of those resources modified to produce reserves.
Ore reserves and mineral resources are reported in accordance with the 2004 edition of the Australian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves the JORC Code or the 2007 edition as amended 2009 of the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves the SAMREC Code.
Remaining mine life: different for each mine, ranging from seven to 21 years.
Expiry date of relevant mining concession licences: different for each mine, ranging from 19June2013 to 7July2028.
There is a routine licence extension procedure in Kazakhstan which Kazzinc undertakes as required.
3 Vasilkovskoye Vasilkovskoye is a gold deposit of epigenetic stockwork type and beresite subtype of deposits hosting ores of gold-quartz formation.
Gold ore mineralisation is confined to a steeply dipping zone of beresite alteration quartz-potassium feldspar metasomatosis which forms a conic stockwork thinning out with depth and located in the near-contact part of granodiorite and gabbro-diorite intrusions.
4 Maleevsky Maleevsky is a typical syngenetic VMS deposit hosting ores of  formation with associated gold and silver.
Maleevsky comprises seven major 10-150m thick, 80-400m wide and 500-1,750m long gently dipping stratified massive sulphides of lenticular and tabular morphology occurring in  deposits changing with depth into steeply dipping linear zones with vein-disseminated ore mineralisation in underlying sequences of brecciated quartzites.
In terms of mineral composition the ores express the following vertical zoning: in the hanging wall pyrite impregnation is consecutively underlain by massive , sphalerite and pyritegalena with barite,  and chalcopyrite-pyrite ores in the lower part: the footwall contains pyrite vein-disseminated mineralisation.
5 Ridder-Sokolny Ridder-Sokolny gold-polymetallic deposit is also VMS type of syngenetic deposits hosting ores of gold bearing  formation.
Ridder-Sokolny comprises over thirty ore bodies of lenticular, vein-stockwork and veined morphology confined to three stratigraphic levels of  deposits.
Gently dipping massive sulphide ores of the upper stratigraphic layer are mostly mined out with the main part of Ridder-Sokolny unmined ore bodies being small pitching and steeply dipping veins and vein-stockwork zones.
The ores of the upper stratigraphic level are mainly , with gold-galena-pyrite,  and chalcopyrite within the middle level and gold-quartz, pyrite and  mineralisation within the lower level.
6 Tishinsky The Tishinsky deposit is a syngenetic VMS deposit of Auand Ag-bearing sulfide polymetallic ores.
Tishinsky resources mainly occur in the Main ore shoot, which extends in EW direction over a strike length of 1,250m with almost vertical dip to the north.
Originally the stratified ore body was flat but eventually became steep dipping due to intensive dynamic metamorphism and shearing.
The mineralisation was delineated by drilling along the stratified mineralised formation of strongly fissile volcanogenic  shale rock to the depth of 1,460m.
The vein-disseminated polymetallic mineralisation prevails at the deposit though the central part of the Main Orebody contains three subvertical lenses of massive sulfides with 60m width, 500m length and thickness varying from 6.5 to 17m.
There are two prevalent mineral associations: A polymetallic  association, and 2 A copper-zinc  association.
Pb content decreases with the depth while Cu content gradually increases eastward and Au content significantly decreases at the western flank of the deposit.
7 Shubinsky Shubinsky polymetallic deposit is a syngenetic VMS deposit hosting ores of  formation with associated gold and silver.
Stratified vein-disseminated polymetallic ores in the near-contact part of volcanomictous  shales with clayey siltstones underwent folded dislocation and occur at 65-80 dip extending down to the 580-725m depth as thin boudinaged lenses changing into subvertical ore shoots.
Primary sulphide mineralisation includes four associations: pyrite, chalcopyrite-pyrite,  and .
Oxidised copper, lead and zinc in the form of chalcosine, covelline, bornite, goslarite and chalcanthite are found down to the depth of 90m.

All open pits and Mindola Mines operations are situated on the eastern limb of the Nkana Syncline.
Central and SOB operations are in other structures within the Nkana Syncline.
Cupriferous Oxide zones are present in the nose and southwest limb of the syncline.
The ore bodies are stratiform and are mainly confined to a recognisable ore formation, which occurs near the base of the Katangan sequence within the Lower Roan Group of the Mine Series.
In the underground workings, the principal copper ore minerals are chalcopyrite and bornite with subordinate chalcocite.
There is a zoning in the geographical distribution of these minerals.
Cobalt occurs as carrollite and cobaltiferious pyrite.
In the open pits, the principal ore minerals are malachite, pseudomalchite, chrysocolla, native copper, cuprite and libethenite in the zone of oxidation closer to the surface.
In some places however, vermiculite, malachite pseudomalachite and accessory wad are more important.
At deeper levels chalcopyrite, bornite and chalcocite are predominantly present.
In the Mufulira mining area, the Basement Complex topography appears to have exerted a significant structural control during deformation.
The distribution of ore minerals in all three ore bodies is stratigraphically controlled, occurring dominantly as disseminations, blebs and irregular masses.
The principal copper minerals are chalcopyrite 60%, bornite 40%, and minor trace chalcocite.

The Kwagga reserve is made up of different sub areas which includes Kwagga North, Kwagga Central, Kwagga Rail and Kwagga Mini Pits.
The various number of years available to mine in the mentioned sub-areas range from two to twelve years.
Pullenshope, Zevenfontein and Kromdraai reserves have an estimated nine years of mining left combined, as several overlapping of the reserves are done during the life of mine in other words the reserves are at some points mined simultaneously.
The Eikeboom reserve is planned to be mined over a total period mining years of 15 years not in one continuous period though.
The reserve is divided up into a portion of in situ coal and a portion of pillar areas.
There is a planned period in-between when dewatering of the old underground mining areas will be done, prior to commencing with pillar mining.
The Boschmanspoort Underground reserve has got eleven years remaining to be mined, and the Pullenshope Underground reserve is currently plan to be mined out in 17 years at the current rates.
reserve block serves as an extension to the Boschmanspoort Underground reserve and more detailed work needs to be done around the block prior to inclusion in the life of mine.
The Schoonoord reserve currently has not been included in the life of mine due to marginal economics associated with the specific project.
Expiry date of relevant mining concession licences: June 2028 for Optimum and October 2032 for Koornfontein.
