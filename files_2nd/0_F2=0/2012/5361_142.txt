The maximum amount of the guarantee is that which is needed at the time the guarantee is called on to bring the schemes funding level up to 105 per cent of its liabilities, calculated in accordance with section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This is also sometimes known as a Pension Protection Fund PPF guarantee, as having such a guarantee in place reduces the annual PPF levy on the scheme.
