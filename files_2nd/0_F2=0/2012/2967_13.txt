into additional transactions in the future to take advantage of the flexibility provided by the DLC arrangement, and to operate both companies as a single unified economic enterprise in the most effective manner.
In addition, under the terms of the Equalization and Governance Agreement and the deeds of guarantee, the cash flows and assets of one company are required to be used to pay the obligations of the other company, if necessary.
Given our DLC arrangement, we believe that providing separate financial statements for each of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc would not present a true and fair view of the economic realities of their operations.
Accordingly, separate financial statements for both Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc have not been presented.

Ships under construction include progress payments for the construction of new ships, as well as design and engineering fees, capitalized interest, construction oversight costs and various owner supplied items.
Capitalized interest, substantially all on our ships under construction, amounted to $17 million, $21 million and $26 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Repairs and maintenance expenses, including minor improvement costs and dry-dock expenses, were $832 million, $830 million and $797 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are substantially all included in other ship operating expenses.
In February 2012, Costa Allegra suffered fire damage and, accordingly, we decided to withdraw this ship from operations resulting in a $34 million impairment charge, which is included in other ship operating expenses.
In addition, during 2012 we incurred $17 million for Costa Allegra incident-related expenses, which are substantially all included in other ship operating expenses.
In October 2012, we sold Costa Allegra.
See Note 7 for a discussion of the January 2012 Costa Concordia the ship incident.
During 2011, we reviewed certain of our ships for impairment since there were indicators of impairment.
As a result of these reviews, in August 2011 we included $28 million of estimated impairment charges in other ship operating expenses as a result of the possible sales of Costa Marina, which was sold in November 2011, and Pacific Sun, which was sold in December 2011.
We operated Pacific Sun under a bareboat charter agreement until July 2012.
