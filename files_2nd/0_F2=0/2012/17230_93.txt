3 Segmental reporting The Groups principal activity is that of retailing, derived solely from the UK.
The Group is not reliant on any major customer for 1% or more of revenues.
Consideration of IFRS 8 Operating segments The Group has made the following considerations in arriving at conclusions and the corresponding disclosure in these financial statements.
IFRS 8 requires consideration of the chief operating decision maker CODM within the Group.
In line with the Groups internal reporting framework and management structure, the key operating decisions and resource allocations are made by the Management Board.
The Directors therefore consider the Management Board to be the CODM.
Consideration in particular was given to retail outlets, the fuel resale operation, the manufacturing entities and multi-channel operations.
Key internal reports received by the CODM, primarily the Board Management Accounts, focus on the performance of the Group as a whole.
The operations of all elements of the business are driven by the retail sales environment and hence have fundamentally the same economic characteristics.
All operational decisions made are focused on the performance and growth of the retail outlets and the ability of the business to meet the supply demands of the stores.
Given this, the Group has considered the overriding core principles of IFRS 8 and has determined that it has one operating segment.
