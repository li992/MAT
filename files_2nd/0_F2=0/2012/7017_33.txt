ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any gain or loss recognised in Other comprehensive income at that time is accumulated in equity and is recognised, when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised, in the Consolidated Income Statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Net investment hedge accounting The Group uses Swiss Franc denominated borrowings as a hedge against the translation exposure on the Groups net investment in overseas companies.
Where the hedge is fully effective at hedging the variability in the net assets of such companies caused by changes in exchange rates, the changes in value of the borrowings are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income and accumulated in the Hedging and translation reserve.
The ineffective part of any change in value caused by changes in exchange rates is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Revenue Revenue represents sales, less returns, by subsidiary companies to external customers excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
Transactions are recorded as revenue when the delivery of products or performance of services takes place in accordance with the contracted terms of sale.
Revenue on long term contracts is recognised while the contracts are in progress.
Revenue is recognised proportionally to the stage of completion of the contract, based on the fair value of goods and services provided to date, taking into account the sign-off of milestone delivery by customers.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment and depreciation which, with the exception of freehold land which is not depreciated, is provided on a straight-line basis over each assets estimated economic life.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: Freehold property 2% Leasehold properties: Long leases more than 50 years unexpired 2% Short leases less than 50 years unexpired Period of lease 1 3 Plant, equipment and vehicles 8% to 33 % Leases Leases that confer rights and obligations similar to those that attach to owned assets are classified as finance leases, of which the Group has none.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals, and any incentives receivable, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions The Group makes contributions to various pension schemes, covering the majority of its employees.
For defined benefit schemes, the asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet is the difference between the fair value of the schemes assets and the present value of the defined obligation at that date.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated separately for each scheme on an annual basis by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, and are taken to Other comprehensive income.
Current and past service costs, along with the impact of any settlements or curtailments, are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Interest on pension plans liabilities are recognised within finance expense and the expected return on the schemes assets are recognised within finance income in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement when they fall due.
Employee share schemes Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups share incentive plan, the share option plans and the performance share plan.
a Share incentive plan Awards of shares under the share incentive plan are made to qualifying employees depending on salary and service criteria.
The shares awarded under this plan are purchased in the market by the plans trustees at the time of the award, and are then held in trust for a minimum of three years.
The costs of this plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting periods of the awards.
100 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements b Share option plans All grants of options under the 1990 and 1996 share option plans and the 1999 company share option plan together, the share option plans are equity settled, and so, as permitted by IFRS 1, the provisions of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment have been applied only to options awarded on or after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 3 April 2005.
The fair value of awards under these plans has been measured at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model and will not be subsequently remeasured.
The fair value is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will ultimately vest and adjusted for the effect of non marketbased vesting conditions.
The corresponding credit is to Shareholders funds.
No further awards will be made under the share option plans.
c Performance share plan On 3 August 2005 the share option plans were replaced by the performance share plan.
Awards under this plan are partly equity-settled and partly cash-settled, and are subject to both market based and non-market based vesting criteria.
The fair value of the equity-settled portion at the date of grant is established by using an appropriate simulation method to reflect the likelihood of market-based performance conditions being met.
The fair value is charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, with appropriate adjustments being made during this period to reflect expected and actual forfeitures arising from the non-market based performance conditions only.
For the cash-settled portion, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated either on a first in, first out or an average cost basis and includes direct materials and the appropriate proportion of production and other overheads considered by the Directors to be attributable to bringing the inventories to their location and condition at the year end.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to complete and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of the cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation Taxation comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in Shareholders funds, in which case it too is recognised in Shareholders funds.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or subsequently enacted at the balance sheet date, along with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method, apart from the following differences which are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates and laws, which are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that recovery is probable.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits with an initial maturity of less than three months, and bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the distribution is approved by the Companys shareholders.

2 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 376,926,013 shares in issue during the year net of shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares 2011: 376,608,974.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated using the weighted average of 377,473,142 shares 2011: 377,365,635, which includes dilutive potential ordinary shares of 547,129 2011: 756,661.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares are calculated from those exercisable share options where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings are calculated as earnings from continuing operations excluding the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition transaction costs, movement on contingent consideration and profit on disposal of continuing operations after tax.
The Directors consider that adjusted earnings represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.
A reconciliation of earnings and the effect on basic earnings per share figures is as follows: Per ordinary share 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 pence pence Earnings from continuing operations 86,714 72,434 23.01 19.23 Add back amortisation of acquired intangible assets after tax 7,561 3,315 2.00 0.88 Acquisition transaction costs after tax 691 1,268 0.18 0.34 Adjustments to contingent consideration after tax 786 167 0.21 0.04 Profit on disposal of continuing operations after tax 3,543 0.94 Adjusted earnings 92,209 77,184 24.46 20.49 104 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 3 Non-GAAP measures The Board uses certain non-GAAP measures to help it effectively monitor the performance of the Group.

Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions, which are the same for all CGUs: Discount rates: Market share during the budget period for the financial year to March 2013: and Growth rate used to extrapolate risk adjusted cash flows beyond the budget period.
Discount rates are based on the Groups borrowing and equity profile.
The Directors do not currently expect any significant change in the present base discount rate of 10.23% 2011: 9.05%.
The base discount rate, which is pre-tax and is based on short-term variables, may differ from the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC used in long-term return measures such as ROTIC.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting the size of each business and specific geographic and industry factors, resulting in the impairment testing using discount rates ranging from 10.75% to 12.98%.
Market share assumptions are important because, as well as the growth rates as noted below, management assess how each units relative position to its competitors might change over the budget period.
Management expects each units position to be stable over the projected period.
Growth rate estimates of respectively 3.25% and 2.50% for the first and second year onwards into perpetuity following the budget year are based on management estimates keeping in view past performance growth.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Management believes that no reasonable potential change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed its recoverable amount.

3 Other intangibles comprise licences and product registration costs amortised over their useful economic lives estimated to be between three and five years.

The Group also holds 50% of the equity of PSRM Immobilien AG PSRM, which it acquired as part of the Medicel AG business acquisition.
PSRM is treated as an associate, and not a subsidiary, because the party holding the remaining 50% is considered to exert more control.
Both associates have a 31 December year end, although results coterminous with the Groups year end have been consolidated.

In the case of trade receivables that are past due, management makes an assessment of the risk of non-collection, taking into account factors such as previous default experience, any disputes or other factors delaying payment and the risk of bankruptcy or other failure of the customer to meet their obligations.
For trade receivables that are not past due, taking into account good historical collection experience, management records an impairment charge only where there is a specific risk of non-collection.
The fair value of trade and other receivables approximates to book value due to the short-term maturities associated with these items.
There is no impairment risk identified with regards to prepayments and accrued income or other receivables where no amounts are past due.

The provisions comprise the Directors best estimates of future payments: a to restore the fabric of buildings to their original condition where it is a condition of the leases prior to return of the properties: and b on vacant properties, the rental costs of which are not expected to be recoverable from subleasing the properties.
These commitments cover the period from 2012 to 2028, though they predominantly fall due within five years.
Product warranty Product warranty provisions reflect commitments made to customers on the sale of goods in the ordinary course of business and included within the Group companies standard terms and conditions.
Warranty commitments cover a period of between one and five years and typically apply for a 12-month period.
The provision represents the Directors best estimate of the Groups liability based on past experience.
Legal, contractual and other Legal, contractual and other comprise mainly amounts reserved against open legal and contractual disputes.
The Company has on occasion been required to take legal or other actions to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties.
Provisions are made for the expected costs associated with such matters, based on past experience of similar items and other known factors, taking into account professional advice received, and represent Directors best estimate of the likely outcome.
The timing of utilisation of these provisions is frequently uncertain reflecting the complexity of issues and the outcome of various court proceedings and negotiations.
Contractual and other provisions represent the Directors best estimate of the cost of settling future obligations.
Unless specific evidence exists to the contrary, these reserves are shown as current.
However, no provision is made for proceedings which have been or might be brought by other parties against Group companies unless the Directors, taking into account professional advice received, assesses that it is more likely than not that such proceedings may be successful.

The second 2% reduction taking effect from 1 April 2012, bringing the overall main UK corporation tax rate to 24%, was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012.
This rate reduction has no material impact on the financial statements as at 31 March 2012.
No account will be taken of the expected further 2% reduction in UK tax rates until substantive enactment of these changes.
Until this change and other potential changes are enacted it is not possible to identify the impact these changes might have.
However, for indicative purposes only, had the UK main corporate tax rate been reduced to 22% the net impact on recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 March 2012 would not have been material.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 13,561,000 2011: 16,079,000 relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timings of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the forseeable future.
Temporary timing differences in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
At 31 March 2012 the Group had unused capital tax losses of 574,000 2011: 808,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Changes during the year in the issued ordinary share capital were as follows: Issued and fully paid 000 At 2 April 2011 37,824 Share options exercised 32 At 31 March 2012 37,856 The total consideration received in cash in respect of share options exercised amounted to 465,000.

The costs of providing this Plan are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the three-year vesting period.
Share option plans The Group has outstanding issued options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company under a share option plan, approved by shareholders in 1999.
This share option plan provided for the grant of two categories of option, both of which are subject to performance criteria.
Section A options are exercisable after three years if the Groups earnings per share growth exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3% per annum.
Section B options are exercisable after five years if the Companys earnings per share growth exceeds the earnings per share of all but the top quarter of companies which were within a peer group at the date of grant of any option.
All options lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
No further awards have been made under the Company share option plan since 3 August 2005.
Options in respect of 2,160,900 ordinary shares remained outstanding at 31 March 2012 under the 1999 Plan.

Performance share plan The performance share plan was approved by shareholders on 3 August 2005 and replaced the previous share option plans from which no further grants can be made.
Awards made under this Plan vest after three years on a sliding scale subject to the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return against the FTSE250 excluding financial companies, combined with an absolute Return on Total Invested Capital measure.
Awards which do not vest on the third anniversary of their award lapse.

Together, both acquisitions contributed 10,198,000 of revenue and 1,992,000 of profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2012.
If these acquisitions had been held since the start of the financial year, it is estimated the Groups reported revenue and profit after tax would have been 1,803,000 and 229,000 higher respectively.
Adjustments were made to the book values of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair values to the Group.
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading were recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with those of the Group where appropriate.
Adjustments to prior year acquisitions resulted in decreases to net assets and consideration payable of 5,000 and 78,000 respectively leading to a reduction in goodwill of 73,000.

Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 125 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Financial instruments Policy The Groups treasury policies seek to minimise financial risks and to ensure sufficient liquidity for the Groups operations and strategic plans.
No complex derivative financial instruments are used, and no trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where the Group does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and, in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
The Groups policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the bases of recognition income and expenses for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in the Accounting policies note.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 17 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk as a consequence of both trading with foreign companies and owning subsidiaries located in foreign countries.
The Group earns a significant proportion of its profit in currencies other than Sterling.
This gives rise to translational currency risk, where the Sterling value of profits earned by the Groups foreign subsidiaries fluctuates with the strength of Sterling relative to their operating or functional currencies.
The Group does not hedge this risk, so its reported profit is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and Euro.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales and purchases are matched where possible and a proportion of the net exposure is hedged by means of forward foreign currency contracts.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and EU, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, China and India.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and cash deposits.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to provide longer term funding are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
Credit ratings are supplied by independent agencies where available, and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed regularly.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and, where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The carrying amount of trade, tax and other receivables, derivative financial instruments and cash of 160,736,000 2011: 153,630,000 represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk as no collateral or other credit enhancements are held.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
126 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk On 20 October 2011, the Group signed a new unsecured five-year revolving credit facility for 260m.
This replaced the previous 165m facility which was due to expire in February 2013.
This facility is the main source of long-term funding for the Group to October 2016, and is with a syndicate of five bankers.
The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures Translational exposures It is estimated, by reference to the Groups US Dollar and Euro denominated profits, that a one per cent change in the value of the US Dollar relative to Sterling would have had a 353,000 2011: 337,000 impact on the Groups reported profit before tax: and a one per cent change in the value of the Euro relative to the Sterling would have had a 227,000 2011: 204,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2012.
Transactional exposures The Group has net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of the underlying company.
These comprise cash and overdrafts as well as certain trade receivable and payable balances.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as result of movement in exchange rates.
The exposures are predominantly Euro and US Dollar.
Group policy is for a significant portion of foreign currency exposures, including sales and purchases, to be hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts in the company in which the transaction is recorded.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 4,006,000 at 31 March 2012 2011: 3,190,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 4,002,000 2011: 2,700,000, and Euro, USDollar and other currency deposits of 4,000 2011: 490,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 41,299,000 2011: 39,420,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 64,014,000 at 31 March 2012 2011: 79,688,000.
All bank loans bear interest at floating rates or fixed rates where the fixed period is typically no more than three months.
Interest rates are based on the LIBOR of the currency in which the liabilities arise plus a small margin.
Bank overdrafts bear interest at local base rates.
2012 2011 000 000 Analysis of interest bearing financial liabilities Sterling denominated bank loans 47,000 53,000 Euro denominated bank loans 3,198 Swiss Franc denominated bank loans 17,014 23,490 Total bank loans 64,014 79,688 At 31 March 2012 it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would reduce the Groups profit before tax by 892,000 2011: 478,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the contingent purchase consideration, other payables, provisions and borrowings due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of the contractual contingent purchase consideration due after one year includes 10,452,000 2011: 8,164,000 due between one and two years, and the balance of 178,000 2011: 13,290,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,017,000 2011: 725,000 due between one and two years, 1,088,000 2011:284,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 653,000 2010: 684,000 due after more than five years.
Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 127 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Financial instruments continued Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of long-term funding is its unsecured five-year 260m revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2016.
Short-term operational funding is provided by cash generated from operations and by local bank overdrafts.
These overdraft facilities are uncommitted and are generally renewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
UK companies have cross-guaranteed 17,370,000 2011: 17,670,000 of overdraft facilities of which nil 2011: nil was drawn.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 31 March 2012 and 2 April 2011 there were no significant differences between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
2012 2011 Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value Fair value and carrying amount of financial instruments 000 000 000 000 Trade and other receivables 105,520 105,520 102,021 102,021 Trade, other payables and provisions falling due within one year 90,768 90,768 83,794 83,794 Trade, other payables and provisions falling due after one year 15,689 15,689 24,441 24,441 Cash and cash equivalents 45,305 45,305 42,610 42,610 Fixed rate borrowings 64,014 64,014 79,688 79,688 Derivative financial instruments in a designated cash flow hedge 306 306 475 475 Derivative financial instruments not in a designated cash flow hedge 37 37 56 56 19,303 19,303 43,823 43,823 The fair value of the floating and fixed rate borrowings approximate to the carrying value because interest rates are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fair value of the derivative financial instruments is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow, using readily available market data and represents a level 2 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
128 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 26 Financial instruments continued Hedging As explained previously, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
These instruments are initially recognised at fair value, which is typically nil, and subsequent changes in fair value are taken to the Consolidated Income Statement, unless hedge accounted.

Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 129 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 26 Financial instruments continued Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on the export of goods to and from the USA, mainland Europe and the UK: and foreign exchange loans to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on translation of the Groups investment in foreign operations which have the Euro and Swiss Franc as their functional currencies.
Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis as described below.
There has been no change to the Groups exposure to market risks or in the manner in which these risks are managed and measured.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the currency of the USA US Dollar currency and the currency of Mainland Europe Euro currency.
The carrying amount of the Groups Euro and US Dollar denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Euro 64,384 66,472 15,062 16,308 US Dollar 98,487 95,572 27,634 23,308 If Sterling increased by 10% against the US Dollar and the Euro, profits before taxation and other equity would decrease as follows: US Dollar Euro 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Profit 3,246 3,097 2,081 1,871 Other equity 6,075 6,144 4,503 4,655 The profit sensitivity arises mainly from the translation of overseas profits earned during the year.
10% is the sensitivity rate which management assesses to be a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups profit sensitivity has increased against the US Dollar because more of the Groups profits are earned in this currency.
27 Commitments Capital commitments Capital expenditure authorised and contracted at 31 March 2012 but not provided in these accounts amounts to 877,000 2011: 920,000.
Commitments under operating leases The Group has entered into commercial leases on properties and other equipment.
The former expire between April 2012 and November 2028 and the latter between April 2012 and January 2016.
Only certain property agreements contain an option for renewal at rental prices based on market prices at the time of exercise.
Total payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Within one year 6,093 6,027 441 377 Within two to five years 15,274 14,526 695 648 After five years 4,558 4,038 25,925 24,591 1,136 1,025 130 Halma plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 2,877,000 2011: 2,495,000 and represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the ancillary contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its UK subsidiaries.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits of up to two-thirds of final pensionable salary on attainment of a retirement age of 60, for members of the Executive Board, and 65, for all other qualifying employees.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Halma Group Pension Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation was carried out at 1 December 2008 by Mr Adrian Gibbons, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The 2011 actuarial valuation has not yet been finalised and is awaiting Principal Employers agreement.
Mr Gibbons also carried out the 1 April 2009 actuarial valuation of the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan on the same basis.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
The accumulated benefit obligation ABO is an actuarial measure of the present value for service already rendered but differs from the projected unit credit method in that it includes no assumptions for future salary increases.
At the balance sheet date the gross accumulated benefit obligation was 186m.
An alternative method of valuation is a solvency basis, often estimated using the cost of buying out benefits at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurance company.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the ongoing liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates that this would amount to 315m 2011: 268m.
