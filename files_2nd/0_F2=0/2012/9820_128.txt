These calls are from overseas based organisations who offer to buy Marstons shares for considerably more than the current market price.
In some cases the caller has suggested that there is currently a takeover offer for Marstons.
There is no such offer and we suspect that the calls are bogus.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited investment advice, offers to buy shares or offers of free company reports.
These operations are commonly known as boiler rooms.
Callers can be very persistent and extremely persuasive.
We are aware that they attempt to persuade shareholders to provide email addresses or other personal information.
Shareholders should not provide any such details.
The Financial Services Authority FSA provides the following guidance should you be contacted in this manner: t obtain the name of the person calling and the organisation they represent: t check that they are properly authorised by the FSA by checking www.
do t call the organisation back to verify their identity using the telephone number listed for them on the FSA register.
