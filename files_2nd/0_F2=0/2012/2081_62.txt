3.3 Key measures Our management and Board monitor a range of financial and operational performance indicators, reported on a monthly basis, to measure performance over time.

The two key measures are Underlying EBIT and Profit after taxation attributable to members of the BHP Billiton Group Attributable profit.

Underlying EBIT is not an IFRS measure of profitability, financial performance or liquidity and may be defined and used in differing ways by different entities.
Underlying EBIT is included in the 2012 Consolidated Financial Statements as required by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
We believe that Underlying EBIT provides useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or alternative to, Attributable profit as an indicator of operating performance.
Our use of Underlying EBIT is explained in section 3.6.
2 Net operating cash flows are after net interest and taxation.
3 Underlying EBIT margin is a non-IFRS measure.
It comprises Underlying EBIT, excluding third party EBIT, divided by revenue, excluding third party product revenue.
