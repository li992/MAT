Regulatory Financial Review Kingston Kingston Wholesale Market : Provision of Alternative Interface Symmetric Broadband Origination at all Bandwidths within the Hull Area The market for the provision of alternative interface symmetric broadband origination includes connections from 2MB s to 1GB s utilising ethernet technology.
Circuit numbers in this category grew 106 over the year in contrast to the TISBO markets.
Compound growth has been 9% p. a. since 2006 07 and this trend is expected to strenghten as additional IP based services are developed and distributed.
Historic operating costs have kept in line with the growth in circuits 12% but a reduction in the holding loss on Exchange - Exchange Transmission Length -0.3m has neutralised the net cost increase.
