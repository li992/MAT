2 Trade and other receivables The provisions account for trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at that point, the amounts considered irrecoverable are written off against trade receivables directly.
Impairment losses are included within administrative expenses in the income statement.
Trade receivables that were past due but not impaired amounted to 5.8 million 2011: 1.4 million and relate to a number of suppliers for whom there is no recent history of default.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables is as follows: 2 December 27 November 2012 2011 m m Past due 03 months 5.7 1.4 Past due 36 months 0.1 Past due over 6 months 5.8 1.4 3.4.

3.5 Provisions Accounting policies Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Insurance claims Provisions for insurance claims relate to potential motor insurance claims and potential public liability claims where accidents have occurred but a claim has yet to be made.
The provision is made based on estimates provided to Ocado by the third-party manager of the Ocado Cell in Atlas Insurance PCC Limited the Ocado Cell.
Dilapidations Provisions for dilapidations are recognised on a lease by lease basis and are based on the Groups best estimate of the likely committed cash outow.

In practice the Ocado Cell receives newly reported claims after the end of the underwriting period that have to be allocated to the year of loss i. e. the underwriting year of occurrence.
The calculation of this provision involves estimating a number of variables, principally the level of claims which may be received and the level of any compensation which may be payable.
Uncertainty associated with these factors may result in the ultimate liability being different from the reported provision.
Although it is expected that most claims will be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the exact timing of utilisation of the provision is uncertain.
Dilapidations The dilapidations provision is based on the future expected repair costs required to restore the Groups leased buildings and vans to their fair condition at the end of their respective lease terms.
The CFC1 lease expires in 2032, with leases for the spokes expiring between 2014 and 2068.
Contractual amounts are due to be incurred at the end of the respective lease terms.
Leases for vans run for five years, with the contractual obligation payable at the end of the five year lease term.
If a non-contractual option to extend individual leases for a further six months is exercised by the Group, the contractual obligation remains the same but is deferred by six months.
