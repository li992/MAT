270 Aviva plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the Companys financial statements A Presentation changes During 2012, the Company reviewed the presentation of its investment in its subsidiary General Accident plc GA which was previously shown net of an intercompany liability in the statement of financial position and determined that the investment should be presented gross of the intercompany liability.
The result of this has been to increase the value of investments in subsidiaries at 31 December 2011 by 13,659 million, intercompany loan liabilities by 13,919 million, and the investment valuation reserve by 260 million.
The value of investments in subsidiaries at 31 December 2010 has been restated by 13,661 million, intercompany loan liabilities by 13,919 million, and the investment valuation reserve by 258 million.
B Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: Restated Restated 2012 2011 2010 m m m Fair value as at 1 January 28,889 31,284 30,897 Movement in fair value 2,134 2,395 387 At 31 December 31,023 28,889 31,284 Fair values are estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 22 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
ii At 31 December 2012, the Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in the UK.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc no longer carries out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2012 are listed on pages 48 and 49.

As announced in the 2012 Autumn Statement, the rate is expected to reduce further to 21% from 1 April 2014 and this would reduce the deferred tax asset to 164 million.
The Company has gross unrecognised tax losses of nil 2011: 296 million and other temporary differences of 50 million 2011: 245 million.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 72 million 2011: 73 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2012 was 4,435 million 2011: 3,814 million.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2012 was 246 million 2011: 246 million.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
F Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 51 g. G Risk management Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the major risks and the Groups approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses the Companys closing share price at year end.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in note E and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each companys net exposure.
The majority of the Companys external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates.
Further details of the Companys borrowings are provided in note E and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in Euros and US dollars.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds investments in these currencies, generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 57 a iii.

As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors Remuneration Report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of materiality.
