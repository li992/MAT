At 31 December 2012, the Company had 111,111 registered holders of 1,246,779,548 Ordinary Shares.
There were 122,617 holders of Ordinary Shares held under the Euroclear Services Agreement, representing 12.9% of the issued share capital of the Company and approximately 235,000 holders of ADRs, representing 11.0% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The ADRs, each of which is equivalent to one Ordinary Share, are issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank JPMorgan.
During 2012, under AstraZenecas share repurchase programme, which was introduced in 1999, 57.8 million Ordinary Shares were repurchased and subsequently cancelled at a total cost of $2,635 million, representing 4.6% of the total issued share capital of the Company at 31 December 2012.
The average price paid per Ordinary Share in 2012 was 2879 pence.
This brings the total number of Ordinary Shares repurchased to date since the beginning of the repurchase programme in 1999, to 615.2 million Ordinary Shares at an average price of 2777 pence per Ordinary Share for a consideration, including expenses, of $29,352 million.
The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged against the profit and loss account reserve.
Ordinary Shares issued in respect of share schemes in 2012 totalled 12.2 million.
The Company suspended its share repurchase programme effective 1 October.
In 1999, in connection with the merger between Astra and Zeneca through which the Company was formed, the Companys share capital was redenominated in US dollars.
On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.
This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985.
Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result of the share cancellation credited to a special reserve, which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date.
This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares for cash, at par.
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights, no dividend rights and are capable of redemption, at par, at the option of the Company on the giving of seven days written notice to the registered holder of the Redeemable Preference Shares.
A total of 826 million Ordinary Shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date, 21 May 1999.
The Company received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6% of Astras shares and the remaining 0.4% was acquired in 2000, for cash.
