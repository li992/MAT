The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps to hedge the risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
As explained in section Q of the Groups accounting policies, such derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
For derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the income statement in the period.
The Group had a small number of outstanding put options which have now matured.
This enabled certain non-controlling Shareholders to require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest shareholding at an agreed multiple of earnings.
These options are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value which is re-evaluated at each period end.
Fair value is based on the present value of expected cash outflows.
The movement in fair value is included in the profit for the year.
