Accordingly, the 2011 comparative results and related notes have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the change as if the new accounting policy had always applied, as described in note A5.
This measure is the formal profi t before tax measure under IFRS but it is not the result attributable to shareholders.
This is principally because the corporate taxes of the Group include those on the income of consolidated with-profi ts and unit-linked funds that, through adjustments to benefi ts, are borne by policyholders.
These amounts are required to be included in the tax charge of the Company under IAS 12.
Consequently, the profi t before all taxes measure which is determined aft er deducting the cost of policyholder benefi ts and movements in the liability for unallocated surplus of the PAC with-profi ts fund aft er adjusting for taxes borne by policyholders is not representative of pre-tax profi ts attributable to shareholders.
