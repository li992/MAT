Notes on the Accounts continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued vii Expenses, including finance charges Expenses are charged to the Revenue Account of the Income Statement, except as noted below: expenses incidental to the acquisition or disposal of fixed assets investments are included within the cost of the investments or deducted from the disposal proceeds of investments and are thus charged to Capital Reserve realised via the Capital Account: 100% of management fees, invoiced to the Company in respect of certain Private Equity investments, are allocated to capital reserves, via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from those investments: 50% of other management fees, and 50% of finance costs both net of applicable tax relief are allocated to Capital Reserves via the Capital Account, in accordance with the Boards long-term expected split of returns from the investment portfolio excluding private equity investments of the Company: and All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
viii Taxation Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted basis in accordance with FRS19 on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the Balance Sheet date, based on tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of timing differences can be deducted.
In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate the tax relief on expenses charged to capital is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses charged through the Revenue Account, then no tax relief is transferred to the Capital Account.
ix Capital Redemption Reserve The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased for cancellation is transferred out of Share Capital and into the Capital Redemption Reserve, on a trade date basis.
