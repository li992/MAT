Resources have been estimated using varying cut-off grades, information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations depending on the type of mine or project, its maturity and ore types such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes that are at each property.
Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity.

these can vary from year to year.
Resource estimates can also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new information pertaining to A mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of a measured the understanding of the deposit and secondly the conversion to ore or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary reserves.
In addition, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not feasibility study.

Therefore, investors are cautioned not to assume extraction can be justified.
A mineral reserve includes diluting that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material be economically or legally mined, or that it will ever be upgraded to is mined.
Mineral reserves are subdivided in order of increasing a higher category.
Likewise, investors are cautioned not to assume confidence into probable mineral reserves and proven mineral reserves.

A probable mineral reserve is the economically mineable part of an indicated and, in some circumstances, a measured mineral resource Tulawaka mineral reserves and resources are stated as ABGs 70% demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study.
