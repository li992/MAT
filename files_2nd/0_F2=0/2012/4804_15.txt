52 DIPLOMA PLC Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 30 September 2012 1.
General Information Diploma PLC is a public limited company registered and domiciled in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is 12 Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6AX.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and were authorised by the Directors for publication on 19 November 2012.
These statements are presented in UK sterling, with all values rounded to the nearest one hundred thousand, except where otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union, and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements of the Parent Company, Diploma PLC, have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, and are set out in a separate section of the Annual Report & Accounts on page 75.
Alternative Performance Measures The Group uses a number of alternative non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures which are not dened within IFRS.
The Directors use these measures in order to assess the underlying operational performance of the Group and as such, these measures are important and should be considered alongside the IFRS measures.
The following non-GAAP measures are referred to in this Annual Report & Accounts.
2.1 Adjusted operating profit At the foot of the consolidated Income Statement, adjusted operating profit is dened as operating profit before amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangible assets, acquisition expenses and adjustments to deferred consideration collectively, acquisition related charges.
The Directors believe that adjusted operating profit is an important measure of the underlying operational performance of the Group.
2.2 Adjusted profit before tax At the foot of the consolidated Income Statement, adjusted profit before tax is separately disclosed, being dened as profit before tax and before the costs of restructuring or rationalisation of operations, the profit or loss relating to the sale of property, fair value remeasurements under IAS 39 in respect of future purchases of minority interests, and acquisition related charges.
The Directors believe that adjusted profit before tax is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
2.3 Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share is calculated as the total of adjusted profit, less income tax costs, but excluding the tax impact on the items included in the calculation of adjusted profit and the tax effects of goodwill in overseas jurisdictions, less profit attributable to minority interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The Directors believe that adjusted earnings per share provides an important measure of the underlying earning capacity of the Group.
2.4 Free cash ow At the foot of the consolidated Cash Flow Statement, free cash ow is reported, being dened as net cash ow from operating activities, after net capital expenditure on xed assets and including proceeds received from business disposals, but before expenditure on business combinations investments and dividends paid to both minority shareholders and the Companys shareholders.
The Directors believe that free cash ow gives an important measure of the cash ow of the Group, available for future investment.
2.5 Trading capital employed In the segment analysis in note 3, trading capital employed is reported, being dened as net assets less cash and cash equivalents and after adding back borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax, amounts in respect of future purchases of minority interests and adjusting for goodwill in respect of the recognition of deferred tax on acquisition intangible assets.
Return on trading capital employed is dened as the adjusted operating profit, divided by trading capital employed plus all historical goodwill and adjusted for the timing effect of major acquisitions and disposals.
Return on trading capital employed at the sector level does not include historical goodwill.
The Directors believe that return on trading capital employed is an important measure of the underlying performance of the Group.
3. Business Segment Analysis For management reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Life Sciences, Seals and Controls.
These segments form the basis of the primary reporting format disclosures below.
The principal activities of each of these segments is described in the review of Group Performance on pages 4 to 21.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers: there is no inter-segment revenue.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment assets exclude cash and cash equivalents, deferred tax assets and corporate assets that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment.
Segment liabilities exclude borrowings, retirement benefit obligations, deferred tax liabilities and corporate liabilities that cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to a business segment.
These items are shown collectively in the following analysis as unallocated assets and unallocated liabilities, respectively.
Group Employee Costs The key management of the Group are the Executive and non-Executive Directors who have authority and responsibility for planning andcontrolling all significant activities of the Group.
The Directors emoluments and interests in shares of the Company are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 34 to 43 and amounted in total to 2.1m 2011: 1.9m.
The charge for share-based payments of 0.8m 2011: 0.7m relate to the Groups share schemes, described in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value of services provided as consideration for part of the grant of the LTIP awards has been based on a predicted future value model and was 0.3m 2011: 0.2m.
Group staff costs, including Directors emoluments, are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Wages and salaries 42.8 38.3 Social security costs 3.8 3.4 Pension costs dened contribution 1.1 0.8 Share-based payments 0.8 0.7 48.5 43.2 The average number of employees, including Executive Directors, during the year were: 2012 2011 Number Number Life Sciences 270 223 Seals 489 432 Controls 292 245 Corporate 11 10 Number of employees average 1,062 910 Number of employees year end 1,117 954 6.

Tax Expense 2012 2011 m m Current tax The tax charge is based on the profit for the year and comprises: UK corporation tax 3.3 3.1 Overseas tax 11.8 9.7 15.1 12.8 Adjustments in respect of prior year: Overseas tax 0.1 Total current tax 15.0 12.8 Deferred tax The deferred tax credit based on the origination and reversal of timing differences comprises: United Kingdom 0.1 0.2 Overseas 0.5 1.0 Total deferred tax 0.6 1.2 Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 11.6 In addition to the above credit for deferred tax included in the consolidated Income Statement, deferred tax relating to the retirement benefit scheme and cash ow hedges of 0.3m 2011: 0.3m was credited directly to Other Comprehensive Income.
A further 0.6m 2011: nil was credited directly to equity which related to share-based payments.
Factors affecting the tax charge for the year: The difference between the total tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2012 2011 m m profit before tax 46.0 39.2 Tax on profit at UK effective corporation tax rate of 25% 2011: 27% 11.5 10.6 Effects of: Change in UK tax rates 0.2 0.2 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 2.7 0.4 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous years 0.1 Fair value remeasurements 0.2 Other permanent differences 0.1 0.2 Total tax on profit for the year 14.4 11.6 The Group earns its profits in the UK and overseas.
The UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 26% to 24% on 31 March 2012: however as the Group prepares its financial statements for the year to 30 September, the effective tax rate for UK corporation tax in respect of the year ended 30 September 2012 was 25% 2011: 27% and this rate has been used for tax on profit in the above reconciliation.
The Groups net overseas tax rate is higher than that in the UK, primarily because the profits earned in the USA are taxed at rates of up to 38%.
A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2011 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and further reductions to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 and 23% effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012, respectively.
The 2012 UK Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce further to 22% by 2014.
These further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate are likely to lead to a further reduction in the future UK current tax charge.
The deferred tax asset at 30 September 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 23% substantively enacted at 30 September 2012.
The anticipated effect of the announced further 1% rate reduction on the Groups current and deferred tax is not expected to be significant.
Dividends 2012 2011 pence pence 2012 2011 per share per share m m Interim dividend, paid in June 4.2 3.5 4.7 3.9 Final dividend of the prior year, paid in January 8.5 6.2 9.5 7.0 12.7 9.7 14.2 10.9 The Directors have proposed a final dividend in respect of the current year of 10.2p per share 2011: 8.5p which will be paid on 23 January 2013, subject to approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 January 2013.
The total dividend for the current year, subject to approval of the final dividend, will be 14.4p per share 2011: 12.0p.
The Diploma Employee benefit Trust holds 962,337 2011: 1,094,512 shares, which are not eligible for dividends.

Earnings Per Share Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic and diluted earnings per ordinary 5p share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 112,373,327 2011: 112,423,842 and the profit for the year attributable to shareholders of 31.3m 2011: 27.0m.
Thereare no potentially dilutive shares.
Adjusted earnings per share Adjusted earnings per share, which is dened in note 2, is calculated as follows: 2012 2011 2012 2011 pence pence per share per share m m profit before tax 46.0 39.2 Tax expense 14.4 11.6 Minority interests 0.3 0.6 Earnings for the year attributable to shareholders of the Company 27.9 24.0 31.3 27.0 Acquisition related charges 5.6 4.3 6.4 4.8 Fair value remeasurement of put options 0.2 0.8 0.2 0.9 Tax effects on goodwill, acquisition intangible assets and fair value remeasurements 0.6 1.2 0.7 1.3 Adjusted earnings 33.1 27.9 37.2 31.4 10.
Goodwill Life Sciences Seals Controls Total Restated Restated m m m m At 1 October 2010 38.2 14.2 14.9 67.3 Acquisitions 7.3 7.3 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.2 45.3 14.2 14.9 74.4 At 30 September 2011 Acquisitions note 22 1.5 3.0 1.1 5.6 Exchange adjustments 0.8 0.7 0.3 0.2 At 30 September 2012 47.6 16.5 15.7 79.8 The Directors carry out an impairment test on all goodwill generally twice a year.
Goodwill is ascribed to a business which, for the purpose of these impairment tests, is referred to as a cash generating unit.
The impairment test requires each cash generating unit to prepare value in use valuations from discounted cash ow forecasts.
The cash ow forecasts are based on a combination of annual budgets prepared by each business and on a five year strategic plan, prepared at a Group level.
The key assumptions used to prepare the cash ow forecasts relate to gross margin, growth rates and discount rates.
The gross margins are assumed to remain sustainable, which is supported by historical experience: growth rates generally approximate to the long term average rates for the markets in which the business operates, unless there are particular factors relevant to a business, such as start-ups.
The annual growth rates used in the cash ow forecasts in respect of the next five years vary between 2% and 5% in each of the sectors: these annual growth rates then trend down towards 2.0% over the longer term.
The cash ow forecasts are discounted to determine a current valuation, using a pre-tax discount rate of ca.
This rate is based on the characteristics of lower risk, non-technically driven, distribution businesses with robust capital structures, which is broadly consistent with each of the Groups businesses.
Based on the criteria set out above, no impairment in the value of goodwill was identied.
The Directors have also carried out sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions to determine whether a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
This analysis indicates that a reasonably possible change in these key assumptions would be unlikely to give rise to an impairment charge to goodwill in any of the businesses in the Life Sciences or Seals segments.
However, in the Controls sector a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in one of the businesses in this sector would result in an impairment charge of up to 0.3m.
Before any sensitivities and based on the original assumptions in respect ofthis business in the Controls sector, there is limited headroom in the cash ow valuation.
In the prior year, the sensitivity analysis indicated that a reduction of 2% in revenue growth in the medium term in the Controls sector would have resulted in an impairment of0.2m.
Theheadroom, before sensitivities, in respect of these businesses in the Controls sector last year was 0.7m.
As described further in the Group Accounting Policies note 1.1, goodwill of 13.1m recognised in the consolidated financial statements at 30September 2011 on acquisition of the outstanding minority interest in AMT, a business in the Life Sciences sector, has been written off directly against total shareholders equity and the balances at 30September 2011 have been restated accordingly.

Financial Instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than a limited number of forward foreign currency contracts, comprise cash and short term deposits, investment, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables, borrowings and other liabilities.
Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables arise directly from the Groups day-to-day operations.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of credit, liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate and capital management.
An explanation of each of these risks, how the Group manages these risks and an analysis of sensitivities is set out below, or on page 25 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties, which has been audited.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations: this arises principally from the Groups trade and other receivables from customers and from cash balances including deposits held with financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government backed agencies and large public and private wholesalers, to small privately owned businesses and the underlying local economic risks vary throughout the world.
Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of potential losses in respect of specic trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the receivable is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
The Group has not had any material irrecoverable trade receivables in the past five years.
Exposure to financial counterparty credit risk is controlled by the Group treasury team in establishing and monitoring counterparty limits.
Centrally managed funds are invested entirely with counterparties whose credit rating is AA or better.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was as follows: Carrying amount 2012 2011 m m Trade receivables 37.0 32.5 Other receivables 1.9 2.2 Cash and cash equivalents 11.4 17.8 50.3 52.5 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2012 DIPLOMA PLC 61 19.
Financial Instruments continued There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the financial assets and their fair value at each reporting date.
An analysis of the ageing and currency of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment is set out in note 16.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents is set out in note 18. b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group continually monitors net funds and forecast cash ows to ensure that sufficient facilities are in place to meet the Groups requirements in the short, medium and long term and, in order to do so, arranges borrowings.
Additionally, compliance with debt covenants are monitored and during 2012 all covenants have been fully complied with.
The Group is highly cash generative and uses monthly cash ow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on deposits.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but the Group also has a committed 20m revolving bank facility with an option to increase its facility to 40m, subject to market pricing which expires in November 2013.
Interest on this facility is payable at between 150 and 195 bps over LIBOR, depending on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
At 30 September 2012, 3.5m 2011: 5.6m of the facility had been drawn down.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 30 September are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Expiring within one year Expiring after one year but within two years 16.5 14.4 The Groups financial liabilities are as follows: Carrying amount 2012 2011 m m Trade payables 20.5 19.6 Other payables 3.1 2.3 Other liabilities 3.8 3.1 Borrowings 3.5 5.6 30.9 30.6 The maturities of the undiscounted financial liabilities are as follows: Less than one year 26.4 22.7 One-two years 3.5 7.7 Two-five years 1.2 0.6 31.1 31.0 Less: Discount 0.2 0.4 30.9 30.6 There is no material difference between the carrying amount of these financial liabilities and their fair value at each reporting date.
c Currency risk The Groups currency risk comprises translational and transactional risk from its exposure to movements in US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euros and Australian dollars.
The transactional exposure arises on trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents and these balances are analysed by currency in notes 16, 17 and 18, respectively.
Net foreign exchange losses of 0.1m 2011: 0.1m gain were recognised in profit for the year.
The Group holds forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecast transactional exposure in certain of the Groups businesses to movements in the US dollar and Euro.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are classied as cash ow hedges and are stated at fair value.
The net fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 30 September 2012 was a 0.3m liability 2011: 0.6m asset.
The amount removed from Other Comprehensive Income and taken to the consolidated Income Statement in cost of sales during the year was 0.5m debit 2011: 0.6m credit.
The fair value of cash ow hedges taken to Other Comprehensive Income during the year was 0.4m debit 2011: 0.6m credit.
The currency risk arising from both translational and transactional risks are described further on page 25 within Principal Risks and Uncertainties.
d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Groups results.
The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from its cash funds and borrowings.
The Group does not undertake any hedging of interest rates.
All cash deposits, held in the UK and overseas, are held on a short term basis at oating rates or overnight rates, based on the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rate.
Surplus funds are deposited with commercial banks that meet the credit criteria approved by the Board, for periods of between one to six months at rates that are generally xed by reference to the relevant UK Base Rate, or equivalent rates.
It is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the Groups adjusted profit before tax.
An analysis of cash and cash equivalents at the reporting dates is set out in note 18.
Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2012 62 DIPLOMA PLC Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 September 2012 19.
Financial Instruments continued e Fair values There are no material differences between the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities and their fair value.
The basis for determining fair values are as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than 24 months from the year end.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the nominal amount is deemed to reect the fair value.
Other liabilities The carrying amount represents a discounted value of the expected liability which is deemed to reect the fair value.
f Capital management risk The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, supplier and market confidence, provide strong returns to shareholders and to support the future development of the business.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, debt, which includes borrowings and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
