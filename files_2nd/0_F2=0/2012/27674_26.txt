Group fInancIal statements notes to the consolIdated fInancIal statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: Significant accounting policies a1: Basis of preparation Statement of compliance Old Mutual plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and equity account the Groups interest in associates and jointly controlled entities other than those held by life assurance funds which are accounted for as investments.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU.
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
The accounting policies adopted by the Company and Group, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities designated as fair value through the income statement or as available-for-sale, owner-occupied property and investment property.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of the previous carrying amount and the fair value less costs to sell.
The Parent Company financial statements are prepared in accordance with these accounting policies, other than for investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates, which are stated at cost less impairments see note E1 n, in accordance with IAS 27.
The Company and Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis which the directors believe to be appropriate having taken into consideration the points as set out in the Directors Report in the section headed Going concern.
Judgements made by the directors in the applications of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note A3.
Translation of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated from their respective functional currencies into the Groups presentation currency using the year-end exchange rates, and their income and expenses using the average exchange rates.
Other than in respect of cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2004, cumulative unrealised gains or losses resulting from translation of functional currencies to the presentation currency are included as a separate component of shareholders equity.
To the extent that these gains and losses are effectively hedged, the cumulative effect of such gains and losses arising on the hedging instruments are also included in that component of shareholders equity.
Upon the disposal of subsidiaries the cumulative amount of exchange differences deferred in shareholders equity, net of attributable amounts in relation to net investments, is recognised in the income statement.
Cumulative translation gains and losses up to 1 January 2004, being the effective date of the Groups conversion to IFRS, were reset to zero.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the operating results, assets and liabilities of key foreign business segments to pounds sterling are: Year ended 31 december 2012 Year ended 31 December 2011 statement Statement Income of financial Income of financial statement position statement position average rate closing rate average rate closing rate Rand 13.0123 13.7696 11.6445 12.5643 US dollars 1.5850 1.6242 1.6037 1.5553 Swedish kronor 10.7363 10.5638 10.4144 10.6801 Euro 1.2326 1.2307 1.1519 1.1970 Developments during 2012 Other than changes arising from new accounting developments as mentioned in note A5, the Group has not made any changes to the accounting policies during the year.

130 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business a2: significant corporate activity and business changes Disposal of Nordic As previously reported the Group had agreed at 31 December 2011 to the disposal of its life assurance operations, asset management and banking operations in Sweden, Denmark and Norway to Skandia Liv.
Following final regulatory approval on 8 March 2012 and subsequent shareholder approval, the sale was completed on 21 March 2012.
The sale represented the Groups exit from the life assurance market in the Nordic region and therefore met the criteria of a discontinued operation.
The assets and liabilities of Nordic were classified as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2011.
At 31 December 2012, following the completion of the disposal, there are no assets and liabilities of Nordic remaining in the Statement of Financial Position.
For the purposes of adjusted operating profit, Nordic is classified as a non-core operation.
Further details of the impact of discontinued operations are provided in note H1.
Special dividend and share consolidation On 9 March 2012 the Group declared a special dividend of 18p per 10p ordinary share to all holders of those shares on the register at 20 April 2012 and the dividend was subsequently paid on 7 June 2012.
A seven-for-eight share consolidation was effected on 23 April 2012 and from 3 that date only new ordinary shares of 11 7 pence have been in issue.
For basic and diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted with effect from 23 April 2012.
For adjusted operating earnings per share the adjustment of the weighted average number of shares has been made effective 1 January 2012.
Consequently the comparative information in the adjusted operating earnings per share note C2 b has been restated accordingly.
Disposal of Finnish branch in Old Mutual Wealth On 21 December 2011 the Group announced that it had agreed terms to sell the Finnish branch of Old Mutual Wealth to OP-Pohjola osk.
The assets and liabilities of the Finnish branch were classified as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale in the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December 2011.
As at 31 December 2012, following the completion of the sale of the business on 31 August 2012, there were no assets and liabilities of the Finland branch remaining in the Statement of Financial Position.
Consolidation of other African businesses As reported in the Groups 2011 Annual Report and Accounts the Groups operations in Zimbabwe, Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland and Nigeria the other African businesses, were consolidated effective from 1 January 2011.
The net asset value of the underlying businesses on 1 January 2011 was deemed to be the fair value of these operations on that date.
As a result of the consolidation of these businesses, the Group recognised a gain on 1 January 2011, which was disclosed as a profit on acquisition of subsidiaries.
The results of the other African businesses were included in the comparatives for the year-ended 31 December 2011.
In anticipation of the indigenisation of the Zimbabwe business a non-controlling interest adjustment has been included for this operation in respect of adjusted operating profit to reflect the agreed indigenous shareholding to be provided.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had completed the transfer of the agreed indigenous shareholding to approved indigenisation and economic empowerment trusts, the majority of which remains fully consolidated for the purposes of IFRS reporting.
Reporting of Retail Europe within Old Mutual Wealth On 24 January 2012 the Group announced that it would combine its Old Mutual Wealth Continental Europe business France and Italy with the Skandia Retail Europe business unit Germany, Austria, Poland and Switzerland.
As a result of these operational changes, the businesses previously reported as the Retail Europe segment are now reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The comparative information for the year ended 31 December 2011 has been reclassified where applicable.
Integration of OMAM UK with Skandia Investment Group On 26 April 2012 the Group announced the integration of Old Mutual Asset Management UK OMAM UK with Skandia Investment Group.
OMAM UK was previously reported within the US Asset Management segment and Skandia Investment Group is reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment.
Consequently OMAM UK is included within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
In September 2012 the Group announced the merger of the Skandia businesses Skandia UK, Skandia International, Old Mutual Global Investors and the Skandia European businesses outside of the Nordic region into a single business called Old Mutual Wealth.
The operational changes are designed to combine asset management capability with UK platform strength and international expertise to grow into a leading provider of wealth management solutions in selected markets.
As a result the businesses previously reported as the Retail Europe segment are now reported within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Cancellation of treasury shares On 13 January 2012 the Group announced that it had cancelled 239,434,888 ordinary shares of 10p each previously held in treasury.
Repayment of debt On 18 January 2012, the remaining 200 million of the 750 million subordinated bond was repaid on the first call date.

On 4 December 2012, 5 million of the 500 million perpetual preferred callable securities and on 5 December 2012, 2 million of the 350 million preferred callable securities were acquired, both via open market repurchase.
131 Group fInancIal statements notes to the consolIdated fInancIal statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: Significant accounting policies continued a3: critical accounting estimates and judgements In the preparation of these financial statements, the Group is required to make estimates and judgements that affect items reported in the consolidated income statement, statement of financial position, other primary statements and related supporting notes.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are those which involve the most complex or subjective judgements or assessments.
Where applicable the Group applies estimation and assumption setting techniques that are aligned with relevant actuarial and accounting guidance based on knowledge of the current situation, and require assumptions and predictions of future events and actions.
There have been no significant methodology changes to the critical accounting estimates and judgements that the Group applied at 31 December 2011.
The significant accounting policies are described in the relevant notes.
The key areas of the Groups business that typically require such estimates and the relevant accounting policies and notes are as follows: area More detail Policy note Financial assets and liabilities E4 E1 Life assurance contract provisions E8 E8 Deferred acquisition costs F4 E8 Intangible assets and goodwill F1 F1 Tax D1 F8 A3 c Specific areas that have required closer attention in respect of the estimates and judgements during the year ended 31 December 2012 are explained in more detail below: a Loans and advances Provisions for impairment of loans and advances The majority of loans and advances are in respect of Nedbank, which assesses its loan portfolios for impairment at each financial reporting date.
Nedbank actively manages their exposure to loans and advances through robust credit approval processes which contributed to the improved credit loss ratio at 31 December 2012 of 1.05% 2011: 1.13%.
The impairment for performing loans is calculated on a portfolio basis, based on historical loss ratios, adjusted for national and industry specific economic conditions and other indicators present at the reporting date that correlate with defaults on the portfolio.
These include early arrears and other indicators of potential default, such as changes in macro economic conditions and legislation affecting credit recovery.
These annual loss ratios are applied to loan balances in the portfolio and scaled to the estimated loss emergence period.
For portfolios which comprise large numbers of small homogenous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on the portfolio, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
There are many models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or client category.
Judgement and knowledge are needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
For larger exposures impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash flows are taken into account.
The level of impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash flows and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculations of future cash flows and change with time as new information becomes available or as strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment provision as individual decisions are taken.
Further detail is provided in note E3.
b Policyholder liabilities Emerging Markets Financial Soundness Valuation discount rate The calculation of the Groups South African Life assurance contract provisions is sensitive to the discount rate applied to future liabilities.
The methodology applied by the Group requires discount rates to be set according to the Financial Soundness Valuation FSV principles as prescribed by the Actuarial Society of South Africa.
In line with these principles the reference rate is selected as the Bond Exchange of South Africa BESA par bond 10-year yield.
During 2012 the reference discount rate applied to its South African business reduced from 8.2% to 6.9% in line with observable market data.
During H1 2012, the discount rate reduced from 8.2% to 7.6%, which resulted in an increase in FSV provisions of 20 million.
During H2 2012, the discount rate reduced further from 7.6% to 6.9%, resulting in a further increase to FSV provisions of 15 million.
During the fourth quarter of 2012 a broad duration-based hedge was implemented which partially mitigated the negative impact of the decline in the FSV rate over H2.
This hedge remains in place and is expected to reduce the South African businesss sensitivity to interest rate movements in future.
The Group estimates that a 1% reduction in the discount rate will result in an increase in policyholder liabilities of 39 million 2011: 42 million, allowing for the impact of the duration-based hedge.
The growth in the book over 2012 and the fact that a 1% fall now represents a larger proportionate fall in interest rates mean that the sensitivity at the end of 2012 is higher than the actual impact observed over 2012.
Further disclosure of the policyholder sensitivity to interest rates is noted in note E8 g. 132 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Emerging Markets discretionary reserves Management has discretion in managing exposure to financial options and guarantees, particularly within participating business.
As required by applicable Actuarial Society of South Africa guidance, the time value of the financial options and guarantees included in the statutory reserves in the Emerging Markets businesses at 31 December 2012, has been valued using a risk-neutral market consistent asset model and is referred to as the Investment Guarantee Reserve IGR.
This reserve includes a discretionary margin as defined by local guidelines to allow for the sensitivity of the reserve to future interest rate and equity market movements.
Further detail is provided in the Old Mutual audited market consistent embedded value MCEV supplementary basis information section of the Annual Report.
Old Mutual Bermuda guarantees Old Mutual Bermuda was closed to new business on 18 March 2009.
Managements key priority since the closure to new business has been to fide-risk the business.
The main risks associated with this business relate to guarantees in the products previously sold by the business.
At 31 December 2012 a total of 21,975 2011: 34,828 contracts remain active, comprising 20,910 variable annuity products 2011: 33,373 and 1,065 deferred and fixed index annuity investments 2011: 1,455.
The variable annuity products provided both a guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB and guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB.
During 2012 the business experienced significantly higher rates of surrender than assumed, with 12,380 variable annuity contracts surrendering in total 2011: 5,657.
The increase in surrender activity was attributable to variable annuity UGO policyholders passing through a top-up process on the fifth anniversary following product inception.
At 31 December 2012 approximately 70% of variable annuity UGO policyholders had reached their 5-year top-up.
At 31 December 2012, 77% of non-Hong Kong policies and 57% of Hong Kong policies had been surrendered on or after their 5-year anniversary date.
The significantly reduced size of the book has meant that associated GMAB reserves have reduced from $1,056 million at 31 December 2011 to $229 million at 31 December 2012 while the associated GMDB reserves reduced from $5 million to $155,677.
The favourable lapse experience has been reflected in surrender assumptions for the remaining policies that are yet to go through their 5-year policy anniversary.
These revised assumptions have resulted in further releases of reserves, contributing positively to IFRS and MCEV operating profits for 2012.
Policies still in force after the 5-year anniversary are no longer subject to surrender penalties.
The Group continues to operate strong oversight over the business.
The key remaining risk relates to the 10-year GMAB top-up process which will commence in 2017. c Tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in which case it is correspondingly recognised in other comprehensive income.
The Group is regularly in discussion with the respective tax authorities in each of the jurisdictions where the Group is active.
In certain circumstances the Group applies its judgement to determine if a provision for future tax should be raised.
The Group reviews any potential exposure to tax authorities under the requirements of IAS 37 to determine if a provision should be recognised.
The measurement of any provisions for future taxes is based on the Groups assessment of the specific circumstances and it applies judgement to determine the most likely outcome of its discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
As these provisions are based on estimates and rely on judgements made by the Group, the actual amount of future taxes paid by the Group could be different to the amounts provided.
a4: liquidity analysis of the statement of financial position The Groups statement of financial position is in order of liquidity as is permitted by IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
In order to satisfy the requirements of IAS 1, the following analysis is given to describe how statement of financial position lines are categorised between current and non-current balances, applying the principles laid out in IAS 1.
The following statement of financial position captions are generally classified as current cash and cash equivalents, non-current assets held for sale, client indebtedness for acceptances, current tax receivable, third-party interests in the consolidation of funds, current tax payable, liabilities under acceptances and non-current liabilities held for sale.
The following balances are generally classified as non-current goodwill and other intangible assets, mandatory reserve deposits with central banks, property, plant and equipment, investment property, deferred tax assets, investments in associated undertakings and jointly controlled operations, deferred acquisition costs, deposits held with reinsurers, provisions, deferred revenue and deferred tax liabilities.
The following balances include both current and non-current portions reinsurers shares of life assurance and general insurance business policyholder liabilities, loans and advances, investments and securities, other assets, derivative financial assets and liabilities, life assurance and general insurance policyholder liabilities, borrowed funds, amounts owed to bank depositors and other liabilities.
The split between the current and non-current portions for these assets and liabilities is given either by way of a footnote to the relevant note to the accounts or by way of a maturity analysis in respect of major financial liability captions.
a5: standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted in the 2012 annual financial statements The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been adopted in these financial statements: IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets Amendments to IFRS 7 was issued in October 2010.
The amendments to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures require enhancements to the existing disclosures where an asset is transferred but is not derecognised and introduce new disclosures for assets that are derecognised but the entity continues to have a continuing exposure to the asset after the sale.
These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
Early application of the amendments is permitted.
The adoption of this standard had no significant impact on the Groups disclosures.
133 Group fInancIal statements notes to the consolIdated fInancIal statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 A: Significant accounting policies continued a5: standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations adopted in the 2012 annual financial statements continued Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets effective 1 January 2012 introduced an exception to the measurement principles of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from investment property measured using the fair value model in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property.
The adoption of this amendment allows the Group to measure deferred tax in Investment Property on the assumption that the carrying value will be recovered principally through sale.
The adoption of these amendments had no material impact on the Groups financial statements.
a6: future standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations not early-adopted in the 2012 annual financial statements At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards, amendments to standards, and interpretations, which are relevant to the Group, have been issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, although the EU has not yet endorsed all of them.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2015 is a new standard on financial instruments that will eventually replace IAS 39.
The published standard introduces changes to the current IAS 39 rules for classification and measurement of financial assets.
Under IFRS 9 there will be two measurement bases for financial assets, amortised cost and fair value.
Financial assets at fair value will be recorded at fair value through the income statement with a limited opportunity to record changes in fair value of certain equity instruments through other comprehensive income.
The main impact for the Group will be the reclassification of the Old Mutual Bermuda business bond portfolios from available-for-sale fair value changes through other comprehensive income to amortised cost or fair value through the income statement.
Financial liabilities are excluded from the scope of the standard.
The Group is currently assessing the full impacts of the standard on its financial statements.
The standard has not yet been endorsed by the European Union IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements effective 1 January 2014 : IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements effective 1 January 2014 : IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2014.
These standards all relate to how the Group will account for its interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, together with new disclosures regarding these investments.
The most significant impact is expected from IFRS 10 which provides a revised principle of when the Group controls another entity.
The Group is currently assessing the full impacts of these standards IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement effective 1 January 2013 is a new standard providing principles on the determination of fair value.
The Group is currently assessing the full impact of this standard Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income effective 1 July 2012 require that an entity present separately the items of OCI that may be reclassified to profit or loss in the future from those that would never be reclassified to profit or loss.
This amendment is not expected to have significant impact on the Group financial statements Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans effective 1 January 2013 require immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income and eliminate the corridor method.
The Group is currently assessing the full impact of this amendment.
B: Segment information B1: Basis of segmentation The Groups segmental results are analysed and reported on a basis consistent with the way that management and the Board of directors assesses performance and allocates resources.
Information is presented to the Board on a consolidated basis in pounds sterling the presentational currency and in functional currency of each business.
Adjusted operating profit is one of the key measures reported to the Groups management and Board of directors for their consideration in the allocation of resources to and the review of performance of the segments.
The Group utilises additional measures to assess the performance of each of the segments, in particular the level of net client cash flows and funds under management.
Additional performance measures considered by management and the Board of directors in assessing the performance of the segments can be found in the MCEV supplementary information.
A reconciliation between the segment revenues and expenses and the Groups revenues and expenses is shown in note B3.
In line with internal reporting, assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated between segments where appropriate and where there is a reasonable basis for doing so.
The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices.
Given the nature of the operations, there are no major customers within any of the segments.
The revenues generated in each reported segment can be seen in the analysis of profits and losses in note B3.
The segmental information in notes B3 and B4, reflects the adjusted and IFRS measures of profit and loss, assets and liabilities for each operating segment as provided to management and the Board of directors.
There are no differences between the measurement of the assets and liabilities reflected in the primary statements and that reported for the segments.
134 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business There are four principal business activities from which the Group generates revenues.
These are life assurance premium income, asset management business fee and commission income, banking banking interest receivable and general insurance premium income.
The lines of business from which each operating segment derives its revenues are as follows: Core operations Long-Term Savings Emerging Markets life assurance and asset management Old Mutual Wealth life assurance and asset management Other core operations Nedbank banking and asset management Mutual & Federal general insurance US Asset Management asset management Discontinued and non-core operations Old Mutual Bermuda life assurance non-core Nordic life assurance, asset management and banking discontinued and non-core Income statement segmentation For both reported periods: Nordic has been classified as a discontinued operation in the IFRS income statement and its results as non-core in determining the Groups adjusted operating profits: and Old Mutual Bermuda has been classified as a continuing operation in the IFRS income statement, but as non-core in determining the Groups adjusted operating profit.
US Life is classified as a discontinued operation in the comparative period.
All other businesses have been classified as continuing operations for both reported periods.
The results of OMAM UK previously included within US Asset Management and Retail Europe are included within the Old Mutual Wealth segment for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Except for OMAM UK, the income statement segmental presentation for the year ended 31 December 2011 is consistent with the above.
Statement of financial position segmentation At 31 December 2011, the assets and liabilities of Nordic were classified as non-current assets and liabilities held for sale.
Following disposal of the business during 2012, no assets and liabilities remain at 31 December 2012.

The following table shows an analysis of those adjustments from adjusted operating profit to profit before and after tax.

These are reversed in the acquisition statement of financial position and replaced by goodwill, other intangible assets and the value of the acquired present value of in-force business acquired PVIF.
In determining its adjusted operating profit the Group recognises deferred revenue and acquisition costs in relation to policies sold by acquired businesses pre-acquisition, and excludes the impairment of goodwill and the amortisation of acquired other intangibles and acquired PVIF and the movements in certain acquisition date provisions.

During the year ended 31 December 2012 the Group incurred expenses of 18 million as initial costs regarding Zimbabwean indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Schemes.
These costs are directly related to the acquisition of the Zimbabwean business.
Further detail has been provided in note A2.
On 31 August 2012, Old Mutual Wealth completed the sale of its Finnish branch at a loss of 27 million.
A profit of 2 million was recognised on the sale of Skandia Services AG Switzerland on 30 June 2012.
On 13 April 2012 USAM, disposed of Old Mutual Capital Inc, a subsidiary, at a profit of 12 million.
On 15 May 2012, USAM disposed of Dwight Asset Management Company LLC, a fixed income affiliate, at a profit of 7 million.

A 3 million loss has been recognised during the year ended 31 December 2012 in relation to disposals of subsidiaries by USAM in previous periods.
On 30 December 2011, USAM disposed of Lincluden Management Ltd, a subsidiary, at a profit of 2 million.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011, the Emerging Markets segment included the South African and Namibian businesses but excluded all other African businesses.
This was consistent with prior periods.
Following a period of greater political and currency stability in Zimbabwe and an expectation that the Group would be able to extract benefits from its Zimbabwean business, it was consolidated for the first time for the year ended 31 December 2011 together with operations in Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland and Nigeria.
The Group recognised a gain of 249 million on acquisition of these businesses for the year ended 31 December 2011. d Short-term fluctuations in investment return Profit before tax, as disclosed in the IFRS income statement, includes actual investment returns earned on the shareholder assets of the Groups life assurance and general insurance businesses.
Adjusted operating profit is stated after recalculating shareholder asset investment returns based on a long-term investment return rate.
The difference between the actual and the long-term investment returns is referred to as the short-term fluctuation in investment return.
Long-term rates of return are based on achieved rates of return appropriate to the underlying asset base, adjusted for current inflation expectations, default assumptions, costs of investment management and consensus economic investment forecasts.
The underlying rates are principally derived with reference to 10-year government bond rates, cash and money market rates, and an explicit equity risk premium for South African businesses.
The rates set out below reflect the weighting of investments in underlying cash, money market and equity assets.
The long-term rates of return are reviewed frequently by the Board, usually annually, for appropriateness.
The review of the long-term rates of return seeks to ensure that the returns credited to adjusted operating profit are consistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long-term.
For Emerging Markets, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets, adjusted for net fund flows.
For Old Mutual Wealth, the return is applied to average investible assets.
For M&F general insurance business, the return is an average value of investible assets supporting shareholders funds and insurance liabilities, adjusted for net fund flows.

e Investment return adjustment for Group equity and debt instruments held in policyholder funds Adjusted operating profit includes investment returns on policyholder investments in Group equity and debt instruments held by the Groups life funds.
These include investments in the Companys ordinary shares, and the subordinated liabilities and ordinary securities of Nedbank.
These investment returns are eliminated within the consolidated income statement in arriving at profit before tax in the IFRS income statement, but are included in adjusted operating profit.
During the year ended 31 December 2012, the investment return adjustment increased adjusted operating profit by 113 million 2011: increase 71 million.
f Dividends declared to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities Dividends declared to the holders of the Groups perpetual preferred callable securities were 42 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 2011: 44 million.
These are recognised in finance costs on an accruals basis for the purpose of determining adjusted operating profit.
In the IFRS financial statements this cost is recognised in equity.
g US Asset Management equity plans and non-controlling interests US Asset Management has a number of long-term incentive arrangements with senior employees in its asset management affiliates.
In accordance with IFRS requirements the cost of these schemes is disclosed as being attributable to non-controlling interests.
However, this is treated as a compensation expense in determining adjusted operating profit.
The loss recognised in the year ended 31 December 2012 was 8 million 2011: loss 6 million.
The Group has issued put options in equities in the affiliates to senior employees as part of its US affiliate incentive schemes.
The impact of revaluing these instruments is recognised in accordance with IFRS, but excluded from adjusted operating profit.
At 31 December 2012 these instruments were revalued, the impact of which was a profit of 13 million 2011: profit 10 million.
h Credit-related fair value gains and losses on Group debt instruments The narrowing of credit spread of the Groups debt instruments in the market price has resulted in losses in the year ended 31 December 2012 of 54 million in Other operating segments and 1 million in Nedbank 2011: gains of 27 million and losses of 4 million respectively being recorded in the Groups income statement for those instruments that are recorded at fair value.
In the directors view, such movements are not reflective of the underlying performance of the Group and will reverse over time.
They have therefore been excluded from adjusted operating profit.
On 1 August 2012 the Group redeemed 388 million of the 500 million senior bond due in 2016 at a cash consideration of 459 million.
The 71 million excess over the nominal value reflects the price of the respective debt instrument prior to expiration.
c2: earnings and earnings per share a Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial period attributable to ordinary equity shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding own shares held in policyholder funds, ESOP trusts, Black Economic Empowerment trusts and other related undertakings.

As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in certain African territories, dividends to ordinary equity holders on the branch registers of those countries or, in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through Dividend Access Trusts established for that purpose.
Following the disposal of Nordic a special dividend of 18.0 pence per 10p share was recommended by the directors and a seven for eight share consolidation proposed, with the consolidation approved at the Companys general meeting on 14 March 2012.
The special dividend was paid on 7 June 2012.
Further details of the disposal of the Nordic business unit have been provided in notes A2 and H1.
A final dividend of 5.25 pence or its equivalent in other applicable currencies per ordinary share in the Company has been recommended by the directors.
The dividend will be paid on 31 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 26 April 2013.
The dividend will absorb an estimated 233 million of shareholders funds.
The Company is not planning to offer a scrip dividend alternative.
In March and November 2012, 22 million and 20 million respectively, were declared and paid to holders of perpetual preferred callable securities March 2011: 22 million: November 2011: 22 million.

154 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business E: Financial assets and liabilities e1: Group statement of financial position The Group is exposed to financial risk through its financial assets investments and loans, financial liabilities investment contracts, customer deposits and borrowings, reinsurance assets and insurance liabilities.
The key focus of financial risk management for the Group is ensuring that the proceeds from its financial assets are sufficient to fund the obligations arising from its insurance and banking operations.
The most important components of financial risk are credit risk, market risk arising from changes in equity, and bond prices, interest and foreign exchange rates, and liquidity risk.
a Recognition and fide-recognition A financial asset or liability is recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument.
The Group fide-recognises a financial asset when, and only when: The contractual rights to the cash flows arising from the financial assets have expired or been forfeited by the Group: or It transfers the financial asset including substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset: or It no longer controls the financial asset nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, regardless of whether it has transferred the asset.
A financial liability is fide-recognised when and only when the liability is extinguished, that is when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, assigned, cancelled or has expired.
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability or part thereof extinguished or transferred to another party and consideration received, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, is recognised in the income statement.
All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery within the timeframe established by regulation or market convention regular way purchases and sales are recognised at trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Otherwise such transactions are treated as derivatives until settlement occurs.
Loans and receivables are recognised at fair value plus attributable transaction costs when cash is advanced to borrowers.
b Initial measurement Financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset or financial liability not at fair value through the income statement, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability.
c Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value.
Fair values are obtained from quoted market prices, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are carried as assets when their fair value is positive and as liabilities when their fair value is negative.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes are included in investment income or finance costs as appropriate.
d Hedge accounting Qualifying hedging instruments must either be derivative financial instruments or non-derivative financial instruments used to hedge the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in fair value or changes in cash flows.
Changes in the value of the financial instrument should be expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item.
The Group designates certain qualifying hedging instruments as either 1 a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment fair value hedge : 2 a hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, or a forecasted transaction, and could affect profit or loss cash flow hedge : or, 3 a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Hedge accounting is used for qualifying hedging instruments designated in this way provided certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria in accordance with reporting standards for a qualifying hedging instrument to be accounted for as a hedge include: Upfront formal documentation of the hedging instrument, hedged item or transaction, risk management objective and strategy, the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness measurement methodology that will be applied is prepared before hedge accounting is adopted The hedge is documented showing that it is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, consistent with the risk management and strategy detailed in the upfront hedge documentation The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured The hedge is assessed and determined to have been highly effective on an ongoing basis For cash flow hedges of a forecast transaction, an assessment that it is highly probable that the hedged transaction will occur and will carry profit and loss risk.
155 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued e1: Group statement of financial position continued d Hedge accounting continued Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that prove to be highly effective in relation to hedged risk, are recorded in the income statement, along with the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to that specific hedged risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, and that prove to be highly effective in relation to the hedged risk, are recognised in other comprehensive income.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
Any previous adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument carried at amortised cost as a result of previous hedge accounting, is amortised in the income statement from the date hedge accounting ceases, to the maturity date of the financial instrument, based on the effective interest method.
For hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, any cumulative gains or losses in equity are recognised in the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
e Embedded derivatives Certain derivatives embedded in financial and non-financial instruments, such as the conversion option in a convertible bond, are treated as separate derivatives and recognised as such on a stand alone basis, when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses reported in the income statement.
If it is not possible to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative, the entire hybrid instrument is categorised as fair value through the income statement and measured at fair value.
f Offsetting financial instruments and related income Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off and there is intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expense items are offset only to the extent that their related instruments have been offset in the statement of financial position, with the exception of those relating to hedges, which are disclosed in accordance with the income statement effect of the hedged item.
g Interest income and expense Interest income and expense in relation to financial instruments carried at amortised cost or held as available-for-sale are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method, taking into account the expected timing and amount of cash flows.
Interest income and expense include the amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences between the initial carrying amount of an interest-bearing instrument and its amount at maturity calculated on an effective interest basis.
Interest income and expense on financial instruments carried at fair value through the income statement are presented as part of interest income or expense.
h Non-interest revenue Non-interest revenue in respect of financial instruments principally comprises fees and commission and other operating income.
These are accounted for as set out below.
Fees and commission income Loan origination fees, for loans that are probable of being drawn down, are deferred together with related direct costs and recognised as an adjustment to the effective yield on the loan.
Fees and commission arising from negotiating, or participating in the negotiation of a transaction for a third-party, such as the acquisition of loans, shares or other securities or the purchase or sale of businesses, are recognised on completion of the underlying transaction.
Other Revenue other than interest, fees and commission including fees and insurance premiums, which includes exchange and securities trading income, dividends from investments and net gains on the sale of banking assets, is recognised in the income statement when the amount of revenue from the transaction or service can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic benefits of the transaction or service will flow to the Group.
i Financial assets Non-derivative financial assets are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through the income statement, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.
An analysis of the Groups statement of financial position, showing the categorisation of financial assets, together with financial liabilities is set out in note E1 m. j Classification of financial instruments Held-for-trading financial assets Held-for-trading financial assets are those that were either acquired for generating a profit from short-term fluctuations in price or dealers margin, or are securities included in a portfolio in which a pattern of short-term profit taking exists, or are derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments.
156 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Financial assets designated as fair value through the income statement Financial assets that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through the income statement are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis for instance with respect to financial assets supporting insurance contract provisions or are managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis for instance financial assets supporting shareholders funds.
All financial assets carried at fair value through the income statement, whether held-for-trading or designated, are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value based on quoted bid prices.
If such price information is not available for these instruments, the Group uses other valuation techniques, including internal models, to measure these instruments.
These techniques use market observable inputs where available, derived from similar assets and liabilities in similar and active markets, from recent transaction prices for comparable items or from other observable market data.
For positions where observable reference data are not available for some or all parameters, the Group estimates the non-market observable inputs used in its valuation models.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate used is a market-related rate at the reporting date for an instrument with similar terms and conditions.
Fair values of certain financial instruments, such as over-the-counter OTC derivative instruments, are determined using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, yield curves, credit spreads, and volatility factors.
Realised and unrealised fair value gains and losses on all financial assets carried at fair value through the income statement are included in Investment return non-banking or in Banking trading, investment and similar income as appropriate.
Interest earned whilst holding financial assets at fair value through the income statement is reported within Investment return non-banking or Banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within Investment return non-banking or Banking trading, investment and similar income, when a dividend is declared.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, other than those classified by the Group as fair value through income statement or available-for-sale.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Third-party expenses such as legal fees incurred in securing a loan are treated as part of the cost of the transaction.
Held-to-maturity financial assets Financial assets with fixed maturity dates which are quoted in an active market and where management has both the intent and the ability to hold the asset to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
These assets are carried at amortised cost less any impairment write-downs.
Interest earned on held-to-maturity financial assets is reported within Investment return non-banking or Banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Available-for-sale financial assets Financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices other than those designated fair value through income statement or as loans and receivables, are classified as available-for-sale.
Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of the purchase.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value based on quoted bid prices.
If quoted bid prices are unavailable or determined to be unreliable, the fair value of the financial asset is estimated using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on observable market data where available at the reporting date.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income.
When available-for-sale financial assets are disposed the related accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the income statement as gains and losses from available-for-sale financial assets.
When available-for-sale assets are impaired the resulting loss is shown separately in the income statement as an impairment charge.
Interest earned on available-for-sale financial assets is reported within Investment return non-banking or Banking interest and similar income, as appropriate.
Dividends receivable are included separately in dividend income, within Investment return non-banking or Banking trading, investment and similar income, as appropriate when a dividend is declared.
Financial liabilities other than investment contracts and derivatives Non-derivative financial liabilities, including borrowed funds, amounts owed to depositors and liabilities under acceptances, are recorded as held-for-trading, designated as fair value through the income statement or as financial liabilities at amortised cost.
Liabilities that the Group has elected to designate as fair value through the income statement are those where the treatment either eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise when using a different measurement basis and are managed, evaluated and reported using a fair value basis.
For financial liabilities recorded at fair value and which contain a demand feature, the fair value of the liability is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be required to be paid.
Financial liabilities categorised at amortised cost are recognised initially at fair value, which is normally represented by the transaction price, less directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
157 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued e1: Group statement of financial position continued Financial liabilities other than investment contracts and derivatives continued Conversion options included within financial liabilities are recorded separately in shareholders equity.
The Group does not recognise any change in the value of this option in subsequent periods.
The remaining obligation to make future payments of principal and interest to bondholders is calculated using a market interest rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond and is presented on the amortised cost basis in other borrowed funds until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
If the Group purchases its own debt, it is removed from the statement of financial position and the difference between the carrying amount of a liability and the consideration paid is included in other income.
k Reclassifications of financial assets A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was required to be categorised as held-for-trading on the basis that it was held for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the fair value through income statement category if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
If a financial asset is so reclassified, it is reclassified at its fair value on the date of reclassification.
Any gain or loss already recognised in profit or loss is not reversed.
The fair value at the date of reclassification becomes its new cost or amortised cost, as applicable.
Other non-derivative financial assets that were required to be categorised as held-for-trading at initial recognition may be reclassified out of the fair value through income statement category in rare circumstances.
Measurement of the asset after reclassification depends on the subsequent categorisation.
A non-derivative financial asset that would have met the definition of loans and receivables at initial recognition that was designated as available-for-sale may under exceptional circumstances be reclassified out of the available-for-sale category to the loans and receivables category if it meets the loans and receivables definition at the date of reclassification and if the Group intends and is able to hold the financial asset for the foreseeable future or until maturity.
In the case of a financial asset with a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life using the effective interest method together with any difference between the new amortised cost and the maturity amount.
In the case of a financial asset that does not have a fixed maturity, the gain or loss already recognised in the available-for-sale reserve in equity is recognised in profit or loss when the financial asset is sold or otherwise disposed.
l Sale and repurchase agreements and lending of securities Securities sold subject to linked repurchase agreements are retained in the financial statements as appropriate when considering the fide-recognition criteria contained within IAS 39.
The securities that are retained in the financial statements are reflected as trading or investment securities and the counterparty liability is included in amounts owed to other depositors, deposits from other banks, or other money market deposits, as appropriate.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell at a pre-determined price are recorded as loans and advances to other banks or customers as appropriate.
The difference between the sale and repurchase price is treated as interest and accrued over the lives of agreements using the effective interest method.
Securities lent to counterparties are retained in the financial statements and any interest earned recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Securities borrowed are not recognised in the financial statements, unless these are sold to third parties, in which case the purchase and sale are recorded with the gain or loss included in trading income.
The obligation to return them is recorded at fair value as a trading liability.
m Categories of financial instruments The analysis of assets and liabilities into their categories as defined in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement is set out in the following table.
For completeness, assets and liabilities of a non-financial nature, or financial assets and liabilities that are specifically excluded from the scope of IAS 39, are reflected in the non-financial assets and liabilities category.

Impairments of Parent Company investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are accounted for in the same way as impairments of other non-financial assets.
o Impairments of financial assets Indicators of impairment A provision for impairment is established if there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover all amounts relating to the financial asset.
Observable data that could come to the attention of the Group that could lead to a provision for impairment to be made include: Significant financial difficulty of the counterparty A breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments The Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the counterpartys financial difficulty, grants to the counterparty a concession that the Group would not otherwise consider It becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation Observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows from a group of assets since the initial recognition of those assets, although the decrease cannot yet be identified with the individual financial assets, including: adverse changes in the payment status of counterparties in the group of financial assets: or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the group of financial assets.
In addition, for an available-for-sale financial asset, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its cost is also objective evidence of impairment.
Financial assets at amortised cost The amount of the impairment of a financial asset held at amortised cost is the difference between the carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the value of expected cash flows, including amounts recoverable from guarantees and collateral, discounted based on the effective interest rate at initial recognition.
In estimating expected cash flows the Group looks at the contractual cash flows of the assets and adjusts these contractual cash flows for historical loss experience of assets with similar credit risks, with this adjusted to reflect any additional conditions that are expected to arise or to account for those which no longer exist.
The impairment provision also covers losses where there is objective evidence that losses are present in components of the loan portfolio at the reporting date, but these components have not yet been specifically identified.
When a loan is uncollectable, it is written-off against the related impairment provision.
If the amount of impairment subsequently decreases due to an event occurring after the write-down, the release of the impairment provision is credited to the income statement.
Impairment reversals are limited to what the carrying amount would have been, had no impairment losses been recognised.
Interest income on impaired loans and receivables is recognised on the impaired amount using the original effective interest rate before the impairment.
Available-for-sale financial assets The amount of the impairment loss of an available-for-sale financial asset is the cumulative loss that has been recognised in other comprehensive income, being the difference between the acquisition cost and the assets current fair value, less any impairment loss on that asset previously recognised in the income statement.
For available-for-sale debt securities, fair value is determined as is the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current market rate of interest.
All such impairments are recognised in the income statement.
The release of an impairment allowance in respect of a debt instrument categorised as available-for-sale is credited to the income statement: the release in respect of an equity instrument categorised as availablefor-sale is credited to the available-for-sale reserve within equity.
p Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Determination of fair value All financial instruments, regardless of their IAS 39 categorisation, are initially recorded at fair value.
The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, that is, the fair value of the consideration given or received.
In certain circumstances, however, the initial fair value may be based on other observable current market transactions in the same instrument, without modification or repackaging, or on a valuation technique whose variables include only observable data.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value that are quoted in active markets are based on bid prices for assets, which in certain circumstances includes using quotations from independent third parties such as brokers and pricing services, and offer prices for liabilities.
When quoted prices are not available, fair values are determined by using valuation techniques that refer as far as possible to observable market data.
These include comparison with similar instruments where market observable prices exist, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
A number of 160 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business factors such as bid-offer spread, credit profile, servicing costs and model uncertainty are taken into account, as appropriate, when values are calculated using a valuation technique.
Changes in the assumptions used in such valuations could impact the reported value of such instruments.
In general none of the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost have a fair value significantly different to their carrying amounts.
Such assets and liabilities primarily comprise variable-rate financial assets and liabilities that re-price as interest rates change, short-term deposits or current assets.
Loans and advances Loans and advances principally comprise variable rate financial assets and liabilities, which are repriced when there are movements in the interest rates.
The Group has developed and applied a fair value methodology in respect of gross exposures of loans and advances that are measured at amortised cost.
The methodology incorporates the historical interest rates per product type and the projected monthly cash flows per product type.
Future forecasts for the overall probability of default PD and Loss Given Defaults LGDs for periods 2013 to 2015 2011: for periods 2012 to 2014, based on the latest internal data available, is applied to the first three years projected cash flows.
Average PDs and LGDs are applied to the projected cash flows for later years.
These results are compared to both regulatory and accounting credit model values.
There are no significant variances in the fair value methodology results compared to the carrying values reported in these financial statements.
For impaired advances, the carrying value as determined from the Groups credit models is considered the best estimate of fair value.
The Group is satisfied that, after considering the internal credit models together with other assumptions and the variable interest rate exposure, the carrying value of loans and advances measured at amortised cost approximates fair value.
Investments and securities Investments and securities include government and  securities, listed and unlisted debt securities, preference shares and debentures, listed and unlisted equity securities, listed and unlisted pooled investments see below, short-term funds and securities treated as investments and certain other securities.
Pooled investments represent the Groups holdings of shares units in open-ended investment companies, unit trusts, mutual funds and similar investment vehicles.
Pooled investments are stated at fair value.
The fair values of pooled investments are based on widely published prices that are regularly updated or models based on the market prices of investments held in the underlying pooled investment funds.
Investment contracts The approach to determining the fair values of investment contracts is set out in the accounting policies section for insurance and investment contract business.
Amounts owed to bank depositors The fair values of amounts owed to bank depositors corresponds with the carrying amount shown in the statement of financial position, which generally reflects the amount payable on demand.
Borrowed funds The fair values of amounts included in borrowed funds are based on quoted market prices at the reporting date where applicable, or by reference to quoted prices of similar instruments.
Other financial assets and liabilities The fair values of other financial assets and liabilities which comprise cash and cash equivalents, cash with central banks, other assets and liabilities are reasonably approximated by the carrying amounts reflected in the statement of financial position as they are short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently.
Fair value hierarchy Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy.
Level 1 quoted market prices: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Instruments classified as Level 1 generally comprise listed equity securities, government securities and other listed debt securities and similar instruments, actively traded pooled investments, certain quoted derivative assets and liabilities, listed borrowed funds and investment contract liabilities linked to Level 1 pooled investments and other assets Level 2 valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial assets and liabilities with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial assets and liabilities valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
Instruments classified as Level 2 generally comprise unlisted equity and debt securities where the valuation is based on models involving no significant unobservable data.
This includes certain loans and advances, certain privately placed debt instruments, third-party interests in consolidated funds and amounts owed to bank depositors Level 3 valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs: financial assets and liabilities valued using valuation techniques where one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Instruments classified as Level 3 generally comprise unlisted equity and securities with significant unobservable inputs, securities where the market is not considered sufficiently active, including certain inactive pooled investments, and derivatives embedded in certain portfolios of insurance contracts where the derivative is not closely related to the host contract and the valuation contains significant unobservable inputs.

In the event that the market for a financial asset or liability is not active, or quoted prices cannot be obtained without undue effort, a valuation technique is used.
The judgement as to whether a market is active may include, for example, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of trading activity, the availability of prices and the size of bid offer spreads.
In inactive markets, obtaining assurance that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or determining the adjustments to transaction prices that are necessary to measure the fair value of the asset or liability requires additional work during the valuation process.
The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data, and so the reliability of the fair value measurement is high.
However, certain financial assets and liabilities are valued on the basis of valuation techniques that feature one or more significant market inputs that are unobservable and, for them, the derivation of fair value is more judgemental.
A financial asset or liability in its entirety is classified as valued using significant unobservable inputs if a significant proportion of that asset or liabilitys carrying amount is driven by unobservable inputs.
In this context, unobservable means that there is little or no current market data available for which to determine the price at which an arms length transaction would be likely to occur.
It generally does not mean that there is no market data available at all upon which to base a determination of fair value.
Furthermore, in some cases the majority of the fair value derived from a valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs may be attributable to observable inputs.
Consequently, the effect of uncertainty in determining unobservable inputs will generally be restricted to uncertainty about the overall fair value of the asset or liability being measured.
The transfers into Level 3 largely relate to instances where inputs on certain financial assets and liabilities obtained from pricing service providers are no longer observable.
The transfers out of Level 3 relate to certain pooled investments no longer being considered inactive and for which observable inputs are now available.
There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.
Additional information on the impact of unobservable inputs is provided in the section headed Effect of changes in significant unobservable assumptions to reasonably possible alternatives.

When parameters are not amenable to statistical analysis, quantification of uncertainty is judgemental.
When the fair value of a financial asset or liability is affected by more than one unobservable assumption, the figures shown reflect the most favourable or most unfavourable change from varying the assumptions individually.
In respect of private equity investments, the valuations are assessed on an asset-by-asset basis using a valuation methodology appropriate to the specific investment, in line with industry guidelines.
In many of the methodologies, the principal assumption is the valuation multiple to be applied to the main financial indicators including, for example, multiples for comparable listed companies and discounts for marketability.
For asset-backed securities whose prices are unobservable, models are used to generate the expected value of the asset, incorporating benchmark information on factors such as prepayment patterns, default rates, loss severities and the historical performance of the underlying assets.
The models used are calibrated by using securities for which external market information is available.
For structured notes and other derivatives, principal assumptions concern the future volatility of asset values and the future correlation between asset values.
These principle assumptions include credit volatilities and correlations used in the valuation of the structured credit derivatives.
For such unobservable assumptions, estimates are based on available market data, which may include the use of a proxy method to derive a volatility or correlation from comparable assets for which market data is more readily available, and examination of historical levels.

Changes in other key inputs such as lapses and non-performance risk were also considered.

The change in fair value due to change in credit risk shown above is determined as the amount of the change in fair value of the instrument that is not attributable to changes in market conditions that give rise to market risk.
For loans and receivables that have been designated as at fair value through the income statement, individual credit spreads are determined at inception as the difference between the benchmark interest rate and the interest rate charged to the client.
Subsequent changes in the benchmark interest rate and the credit spread give rise to changes in fair value of the financial instrument.
Loans and advances are reviewed for observable changes in credit risk, and the credit spread is adjusted at subsequent dates if there has been an observable change in credit risk relating to a particular loan or advance.
No credit derivatives are used to hedge the credit risk on any of the financial assets designated at fair value through the income statement.
The change in fair value due to credit risk of financial liabilities designated at fair value through the income statement has been determined as the difference between fair values determined using a liability curve adjusted for credit and a risk-free liability curve.
This difference is cross-checked to market-related data on credit spreads, where available.
q Risks Market risk i Overview Market risk is the risk of a financial impact arising from the changes in values of financial assets or financial liabilities from changes in equity, bond and property prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Market risk arises differently across the Groups businesses depending on the types of financial assets and liabilities held.
Each of the Groups business units has an established set of policies, principles and governance processes to manage market risk within their individual businesses and in accordance with their local regulatory requirements.
A monitoring process established at a Group level overlies these individual approaches to the management of market risk.
The impacts of changes in market risk are monitored and managed through the business units own regulatory processes, with reference to the Groups economic capital processes, and by other means.
The sensitivity of the Groups earnings, capital position and embedded value is monitored through the Groups embedded value and economical capital reporting processes.
ii Insurance operations For the Groups insurance operations, equity property, volatility and interest rate risk exposure are quantified in accordance with the Groups risk-based capital practices, which require sufficient capital to be held in excess of the statutory minimum.
Additional detail is provided in the Risk and Capital Management section.
In South Africa the stock selection and investment analysis process is supported by a well-developed research function.
For fixed annuities, market risks are managed where possible by investing in fixed interest securities with a duration closely corresponding to those liabilities.
Market risk on policies that include specific guarantees and where shareholders carry the investment risk, principally reside in the South African guaranteed non-profit annuity book, which is closely matched with gilts and semi-gilts.
Other non-profit policies are also suitably matched based upon comprehensive investment guidelines.
Market risk on with-profit policies, where investment risk is shared, is minimised by appropriate bonus declaration practices in line with our Principles and Practices of Financial Management and hedging.
167 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued e1: Group statement of financial position continued q Risks continued Market risk continued ii Insurance operations continued For the variable annuity business in Old Mutual Bermuda, market risk to shareholders arises from offering policyholder guaranteed returns.
In addition, these guarantees are US dollar denominated and a significant portion of the underlying assets invested in by Old Mutual Bermudas clients are exposed to currencies other than US dollar.
The market and currency risk is dynamically managed, with the overall exposures to changes in markets monitored closely so that timely actions can be taken to re-establish hedging as required.
In Old Mutual Wealths unit-linked assurance operations, the Group has limited exposure to the volatility from equity markets because, in the main, equity risk is borne by policyholders subject to the impact on asset-based fees charged on policyholder funds.
In respect of Old Mutual Wealths shareholders funds, equity risks are addressed in Old Mutual Wealths investment policy, which provides for very limited opportunity for entities to invest their own capital in equities and equity funds.
In some areas of Old Mutual Wealths business, most notably its traditional life insurance business, Old Mutual Wealth is exposed to market risks arising from various forms of guarantees.
Typically the policyholder is guaranteed a certain return regardless of the asset return achieved during the term of the policy.
These risks are closely monitored and mitigated by applying asset and liability management techniques, ensuring that the proceeds from sale of assets are sufficient to meet the obligations to policyholders.
Sensitivities to adverse impacts of changes in market prices arising in the Groups insurance operations are set out in the Old Mutual audited Market Consistent Embedded Value supplementary basis information section of the Annual Report and Accounts on pages 247 and 248. iii Banking operations The principal market risks arising in the Groups banking operations arise from: Trading risk in Nedbank Capital: and Banking book interest rate risk from repricing and or maturity mismatches between onand off-balance sheet components in all banking businesses.
A comprehensive market risk framework is used to ensure that market risks are understood and managed.
Governance structures are in place to achieve effective independent monitoring and management of market risk.
Trading risk Market risk exposures from trading activities at Nedbank Capital are measured using Value-at-Risk VaR, supplemented by sensitivity analysis, and stress-scenario analysis, and limit structures are set accordingly.
The VaR risk measure for Nedbank estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregated to arrive at a single risk number.
The one-day 99% VaR number used by Nedbank represents the overnight loss that has less than 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
By its nature, VaR is only a single measure and cannot be relied upon on its own as a means of measuring and managing risk.

168 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Nedbank uses standard analytical techniques to measure interest rate sensitivity within its banking book.
This includes static re-price gap analysis and a point-in-time interest income stress testing for parallel interest rate moves over a forward-looking 12-month period.
At 31 December 2012 the sensitivity of the banking book to a 1% instantaneous reduction in interest rates would have led to a reduction in net interest income and equity of 59 million 2011: 67 million.
The table below shows the re-pricing profile of Nedbanks banking book, which highlights the fact that assets re-price quicker than liabilities following derivative hedging activities: m up to 3 3 to 6 6 months 1 to 5 over trading and at 31 december 2012 months months to 1 year years 5 years non-rate total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 33,489 1,156 1,316 3,358 1,366 8,914 49,599 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 30,353 1,971 1,643 1,275 177 14,180 49,599 Interest rate hedging activities 425 1,593 959 2,057 920 Repricing profile 3,561 778 632 26 269 5,266 Cumulative repricing profile 3,561 4,339 4,971 4,997 5,266 Expressed as a % of total assets 7.2% 8.7% 10.0% 10.1% 10.6% m Up to 3 3 to 6 6 months 1 to 5 Over Trading and At 31 December 2011 months months to 1 year years 5 years non-rate Total Interest rate re-pricing gap Total assets 38,262 704 510 2,782 1,165 8,162 51,585 Total liabilities and shareholders funds 32,895 2,371 2,021 1,507 154 12,637 51,585 Interest rate hedging activities 236 1,496 1,083 1,336 1,007 Repricing profile 5,131 171 428 61 4 4,475 Cumulative repricing profile 5,131 4,960 4,532 4,471 4,475 Expressed as a % of total assets 9.9% 9.6% 8.8% 8.7% 8.7% r Capital management The Group actively manages its capital with a focus on capital efficiency and effective risk management.
The capital objectives are to maintain the Groups ability to continue as a going concern while supporting the optimisation of return relative to the risks.
The Group ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and strategic initiatives.
The Groups overall capital risk appetite is set with reference to the requirements of the relevant stakeholders and seeks to: Maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support stakeholder requirements Optimise debt to equity structure to enhance shareholder returns Retain financial flexibility by maintaining liquidity including unutilised committed credit lines.
The primary sources of capital used by the Group are equity shareholders funds, preference shares, subordinated debt and borrowings.
Alternative resources are utilised where appropriate.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
The individual companies in the Group are subject to regulatory capital requirements at an individual level.
In addition the Group as a whole is subject to the solvency requirements of the Financial Groups Directive FGD as implemented by the FSA.
Further detail as to the Groups regulatory capital surplus and that of subsidiaries is provided in the Annual Report.
As at the date of issue of these financial statements the unaudited pro-forma surplus was estimated to be 2.0 billion 2011: 2.2 billion.
The FGD position will be submitted to the FSA by 30 April 2013.
It is critical that the Groups capital management policies are aligned with the Groups overall strategy, business plans and risk appetite.
The Groups Capital Management Committee GCMC reviews the capital structure regularly.
Further detail on the capital management is included in the Risk and Capital Management section of the Annual Report and Accounts.
s Currency translation risk The Group is exposed, from an earnings and capital perspective, to movements in exchange rates reducing the sterling value of subsidiaries assets and earnings denominated in foreign currencies.
The functional currencies of its principal operations, other than for the UK operations, are South African rand, US dollar, and euro.
The Group reduces this risk through the use of currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Such risk mitigation techniques are reflected in the currency analyses that follow.
The exposure to currency risk on the policyholder funds is included under market risk as discussed above.

The risk of changes in the value of these currencies in relation to pounds is partially mitigated due to the unit-linked investments and policyholder liabilities absorbing such changes.
A 10% reduction in the rates used to translate the major currencies shown above to pounds as set out in note A1 would result in a reduction in profit after tax of 207 million 2011: 118 million.
The Group reduces the risk to foreign currency fluctuations through the use of currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts note E6.
The Group further reduces its exposure to foreign exchange movements through net investment hedges note E7.
There are no direct exposures to the unit-linked investments and related policyholder liabilities.
e2: credit risk Overall exposure to credit risk The Group is exposed to banking credit risk from lending and other financing activities, through its exposure to Nedbank.
Nedbanks lending portfolio forms a substantial part of the Groups loans and advances, as analysed in Note E3.
Credit risk represents the most significant risk type facing Nedbank, accounting for 58% of its economic capital requirements.
Nedbanks credit risk profile is managed in terms of its credit risk management framework, which encompasses comprehensive credit risk policy, mandate limits and governance structures, and is approved by the Nedbank Board.
The Group is also exposed to the risk of credit defaults and to a much lesser extent movements in credit spreads from our insurance businesses.
This includes counterparty default risk, which arises mainly from lending activities, and reinsurance and hedging arrangements.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the financial loss from defaults.
The Groups exposure and the credit rating of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Group does not have significant credit exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The credit risk on liquid funds, derivative financial instruments and portfolios of debt and similar securities is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and limits are placed on exposures to below investmentgrade holdings.
Other than the above, the Group has other limited credit risk exposures in respect of amounts due from policyholders, intermediaries and reinsurers.
None of the life assurance operations cedes significant risk through reinsurance and any loans to policyholders are secured on the surrender value of the relevant policies.
The table below represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account the value of any collateral obtained.
The total credit exposure also includes potential exposure arising from financial guarantees given by the Group and undrawn loan commitments, which are not yet reflected in the Groups statement of financial position.

Collateral held includes cash and debt securities.
Cash collateral is included as part of cash equivalents.
These transactions are entered into under terms and conditions that are standard industry practice to securities borrowing and lending activities.
ii Non-financial collateral The Group takes other physical collateral to recover outstanding lending exposures in the event of the borrower being unable or unwilling to fulfil its obligations.
This includes mortgage over property both residential and commercial, and liens over business assets including, but not limited to plant, vehicles, aircraft, inventories and trade debtors and guarantees from parties other than the borrower.

In local currency terms Nedbank experienced a reduction in the impairment charge for the year.
Given the levels of overall consumer indebtedness, credit risk management remained a strong area of focus.
The reduction in specific impairments was driven by a decrease in defaulted advances, while there was further strengthening of the portfolio impairments charge mainly on the performing personal loans, Motor Finance Corporation MFC and home loans books.
The increased level of portfolio impairments was mainly as a result of further model conservatism and book growth in personal loans, as well as the lengthening of the emergence period in the MFC book.
Impairments in Nedbanks Retail division were maintained within target levels, reflecting the effect of asset mix changes as unsecured lending attracts higher levels of impairments than secured lending.
Nedbank Wealths impairment ratios deteriorated mainly due to the impact of a subdued property market.
Further detail on Nedbank is available at www.
During the year under review, the Group recognised collateral of 42 million 2011: 49 million in the statement of financial position.
These amounts are being included in the loans and advances above as properties in possession.

At 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011, the Group has not provided any cash collateral.
e6: derivative financial instruments assets and liabilities The Group utilises derivative instruments for both hedging and non-hedging purposes.
The derivative instruments become in-the-money or out-of-the-money as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates or asset prices relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments on hand, the extent to which instruments are in-the-money or out-of-themoney and, therefore, the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The Group undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with whom it deals, and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Group.

e8: Insurance and investment contracts Life assurance Classification of contracts Contracts sold as life assurance with the exception of unit-linked assurance contracts are categorised into insurance contracts, contracts with a discretionary participation feature or investment contracts, being in accordance with the classification criteria set out in the following paragraphs.
For the Groups unit-linked assurance business, contracts are separated into an insurance component and an investment component known as unbundling, and each unbundled component is accounted for separately in accordance with the accounting policy for that component.
Unit-linked assurance contracts are savings contracts with a small or insignificant component of insurance risk.
Contracts under which the transfer of insurance risk to the Group from the policyholder is not significant are classified as investment contracts.
Such contracts include savings and or investment contracts sold without life assurance protection.
Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party the policyholder by agreeing to compensate the policyholder or other beneficiary if a specified uncertain future event the insured event adversely affects the policyholder are classified as insurance contracts.
Insurance risk is risk other than financial risk.
Contracts accounted for as insurance contracts include life assurance contracts and savings contracts providing more than an insignificant amount of life assurance protection.
Financial risk is the risk of a possible future change in one or more of a specified interest rate, security price, security index, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, a credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided, in the case of a non-financial variable, that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract.
Contracts with a discretionary participating feature are those under which the policyholder holds a contractual right to receive additional payments as a supplement to guaranteed minimum payments.
These additional payments, the amount or timing of which is at the Groups discretion, represent a significant portion of the total contractual payments and are contractually based on 1 the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract, 2 realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the Group or 3 the profit or loss of the Group.
Investment contracts with discretionary participating features, which have no life assurance protection in the policy terms, are accounted for in the same manner as insurance contracts.
176 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Premiums on life assurance Premiums and annuity considerations receivable under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are stated gross of commission, and exclude taxes and levies.
Premiums in respect of linked insurance contracts are recognised when the liability is established.
Premiums in respect of other insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are recognised when due for payment.
Outward reinsurance premiums are recognised when due for payment.
Amounts received under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deposits and credited directly to investment contract liabilities.
Revenue on investment management service contracts Fees charged for investment management services provided in conjunction with an investment contract are recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
Initial fees, which exceed the level of recurring fees and relate to the future provision of services are deferred and amortised over the anticipated period in which services will be provided.
Fees charged for investment management service contracts by asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
Claims paid on life assurance Claims paid under insurance contracts and investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature include maturities, annuities, surrenders, death and disability payments.
Maturity and annuity claims are recorded as they fall due for payment.
Death and disability claims and surrenders are accounted for when notified.
Reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in the same period as the related claim.
Amounts paid under investment contracts other than those with a discretionary participating feature and unit-linked assurance contracts are recorded as deductions from investment contract liabilities.
Insurance contract provisions Insurance contract provisions for African businesses have been computed using a gross premium valuation method.
Provisions in respect of African business have been made in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis as set out in the guidelines issued by the Actuarial Society of South Africa in Standard of Actuarial Practice SAP 104 2012.
Under this guideline, provisions are valued using realistic expectations of future experience, with margins for prudence and deferral of profit emergence.
Provisions for investment contracts with a discretionary participating feature are also computed using the gross premium valuation method in accordance with the Financial Soundness Valuation basis.
Surplus allocated to policyholders but not yet distributed related to these contracts is included as part of life assurance policyholder liabilities.
Reserves on immediate annuities and guaranteed payments are computed on the prospective deposit method, which produces reserves equal to the present value of future benefit payments.
For other territories, the valuation bases adopted are in accordance with local actuarial practices and methodologies.
Derivatives embedded in an insurance contract are not separated and measured at fair value if the embedded derivative itself qualifies for recognition as an insurance contract.
In this case the entire contract is measured as described above.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its insurance liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and intangible assets is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount to the carrying value of the liability at discount rates appropriate to the business in question.
Where a shortfall is identified, an additional provision is made.
The provision estimation techniques and assumptions are periodically reviewed, with any changes in estimates reflected in the income statement as they occur.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross insurance contract provisions and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
In respect of the South Africa life assurance, shadow accounting is applied to insurance contract provisions where the underlying measurement of the policyholder liability depends directly on the value of owner-occupied property and the unrealised gains and losses on such property, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The shadow accounting adjustment to insurance contract provisions is recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the unrealised gains or losses on owner-occupied property backing insurance contract provisions are also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Financial guarantee contracts are recognised as insurance contracts.
Liability adequacy testing is performed to ensure that the carrying amount of the liability for financial guarantee contracts is sufficient.
177 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued e8: Insurance and investment contracts continued Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups non-linked business are recorded at amortised cost unless they are designated at fair value through the income statement in order to eliminate or significantly reduce a measurement or recognition inconsistency, for example where the corresponding assets are recorded at fair value through the income statement.
Investment contract liabilities in respect of the Groups linked business are recorded at fair value.
For such liabilities, including the deposit component of unbundled unit-linked assurance contracts, fair value is calculated as the account balance, which is the value of the units allocated to the policyholder, based on the bid price of the assets in the underlying fund adjusted for tax.
Investment contract liabilities measured at fair value are subject to a deposit floor such that the liability established cannot be less than the amount repayable on demand.
Acquisition costs Acquisition costs for insurance contracts comprise all direct and indirect costs arising from the sale of insurance contracts.
As the gross premium valuation method used in African territories to determine insurance contract provisions makes implicit allowance for the deferral of acquisition costs, no explicit deferred acquisition cost asset is recognised in the statement of financial position for the contracts issued in these areas.
Deferral of costs on insurance business in other territories is limited to the extent that they are deemed recoverable from available future margins.
Costs incurred in acquiring investment management service contracts Incremental costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management service contract are recognised as an asset if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are amortised as the related revenue is recognised.
Costs attributable to investment management service contracts in the asset management businesses are also recognised on this basis.
General insurance Contracts under which the Group accepts significant insurance risk from another party and are not classified as life insurance are classified as general insurance.
All classes of general insurance business are accounted for on an annual basis.
Premiums in general insurance Premiums stated gross of commissions exclude taxes and levies and are accounted for in the period in which the risk commences.
The proportion of the premiums written relating to periods of risk after the reporting date is carried forward to subsequent accounting periods as unearned premiums, so that earned premiums relate to risks carried during the accounting period.
Outward reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the premiums for the related direct insurance.
Claims on general insurance Claims incurred comprise the settlement and handling costs of paid and outstanding claims arising during the year and adjustments to prior year claim provisions.
Outstanding claims comprise claims incurred up to, but not paid, at the end of the accounting period, whether reported or not.
Outstanding claims do not include any provision for possible future claims where the claims arise under contracts not in existence at the reporting date.
The Group performs liability adequacy testing at a business unit level on its claim liabilities to ensure that the carrying amount of its liabilities less related deferred acquisition costs and the unearned premium reserve is sufficient in view of estimated future cash flows.
Whilst the directors consider that the gross provisions for claims and the related reinsurance recoveries are fairly stated on the basis of the information currently available to them, the ultimate liability will vary as a result of subsequent information and events, and may result in significant adjustments to the amount provided.
Adjustments to the amounts of claims provisions established in prior years are reflected in the financial statements for the period in which the adjustments are made, and disclosed separately if material.
The methods used and estimates made are reviewed regularly.
Acquisition costs on general insurance Acquisition costs, which represent commission and other related expenses, are deferred and amortised over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
Reinsurance The Group cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business for the purpose of limiting its net loss potential through the diversification of its risks.
Assets, liabilities and income and expense arising from ceded reinsurance contracts are presented separately from the related assets, liabilities, income and expense from the related insurance contracts because the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve the Group from its direct obligations to its policyholders.
Only rights under contracts that give rise to a significant transfer of insurance risk are accounted for as reinsurance assets.
Rights under contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for as financial instruments.
178 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Reinsurance premiums for ceded reinsurance are recognised as an expense on a basis that is consistent with the recognition basis for the premiums on the related insurance contracts.
For general insurance business, reinsurance premiums are expensed over the period that the reinsurance cover is provided, based on the expected pattern of the reinsured risks.
The unexpensed portion of ceded reinsurance premiums is included in reinsurance assets.
The net amounts paid to a reinsurer at the inception of a contract may be less than the reinsurance assets recognised by the Group in respect of its rights under such contracts.
Any difference between the premium due to the reinsurer and the reinsurance asset recognised is included in the income statement in the period in which the reinsurance premium is due.
The amounts recognised as reinsurance assets are measured on a basis that is consistent with the measurement of the provisions held in respect of the related insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets include recoveries due from reinsurance companies in respect of claims paid.
Reinsurance assets are assessed for impairment at each reporting date.
An asset is deemed impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred after its initial recognition, that the Group may not recover all amounts due, and that the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.

The Group acknowledges that for general insurance the unearned premium provision, which will be recognised as earned premium in the future, will most likely not lead to claim cash outflows equal to this provision.
The Group has however adopted a conservative approach in estimating future cash outflows associated with unearned premiums, by assuming a 100% combined ratio.

Insurance risk includes mortality and morbidity risk in the case of life assurance or risk of loss from fire, accident, or other source in the case of general insurance.
Insurance risk arises through exposure to unfavourable claims experience on life assurance, critical illness and other protection business and exposure to unfavourable operating experience in respect of factors such as persistency levels and management expenses.
Uncertainty in persistency, expenses and mortality and morbidity claim rates, relative to the actuarial assumptions made in the pricing process, may prevent the Group from achieving its profit objectives.
For accounting purposes insurance risk is defined as risk other than financial risk.
Contracts issued by the Group may include both insurance and financial risk: contracts with significant insurance risk are classified as insurance contracts, while contracts with no or insignificant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.
The Group has developed a risk policy which sets out the practices which are used to manage insurance risk and the management information and stress testing requirements.
The policy is cascaded to all entities across the Group who each have their own risk policy suite aligned to the Group.
As well as management of persistency, expense and claims experience, the risk policy sets requirements and standards on matters such as underwriting and claims management practices, and the use of reinsurance to mitigate insurance risk.
181 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 E: Financial assets and liabilities continued e8: Insurance and investment contracts continued f Insurance risk continued The insurance risk profile and experience is closely monitored to ensure that the exposure remains acceptable.
The financial impact of insurance risk events is examined through stress tests carried out within the MCEV and IFRS sensitivities, ICA and Economic Capital assessment.
Mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity risk is the risk that death, critical illness and disability claims are higher than expected, and recovery rates on disability lower than expected.
Possible causes are new and unexpected epidemics and widespread changes in lifestyle such as eating, smoking and exercise habits.
Higher than expected claims levels will reduce expected emerging profits.
For contracts where the insured risk is survival, the most significant factor that is likely to adversely impact the claims experience is continued improvement in medical science and social conditions that increase longevity.
For unit-linked contracts a risk charge is applied to meet the expected cost of the insured benefit in excess of the unit value.
This risk charge can be altered in the event of significant changes in the expectation for future claims experience, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
The operations manage mortality and morbidity risks through its underwriting policy and external reinsurance arrangements where its policy is to retain certain types of insurance risks within specified maximum single event loss limits.
Exposures above accepted limits are transferred to reinsurance counterparties.
Persistency Persistency risk is the risk of higher than expected policyholder surrenders, transfers or premium cessation on contracts, leading to a reduction in financial profit.
In order to limit this risk to an acceptable level, products including charging and commission structures are designed to limit the risk of direct financial loss on surrender, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Persistency statistics are monitored monthly and a detailed persistency analysis at a product level is carried out on an annual basis.
Management actions may be triggered if statistics show significant adverse movement or emerging trends in experience.
Expenses Expense risk is the risk that actual expenses and expense inflation exceed expected levels.
This may result in emerging profit falling below the Groups profit objectives.
Expense levels are monitored quarterly against budgets and forecasts.
An activity-based costing process is used to allocate costs relating to processes and activities to individual product lines.
Some products structures include maintenance charges.
These charges are reviewed annually in light of changes in maintenance expense levels.
This review may result in changes in charge levels, subject to Treating Customers Fairly principles.
Tax Tax risk is the risk that insufficient tax is collected from the policyholders because the projected taxation basis for basic life assurance business is incorrect, resulting in contracts being incorrectly priced.
Tax risk also represents potential changes in the interpretation or application of prevailing tax legislation as paid by either policyholders or shareholders, resulting in higher taxes reducing profitability or increasing shareholder tax burdens.
The taxation position of the operations is projected annually and tax changes will result in changes to new business pricing models as part of the annual control cycle.
High risk issues and emerging trends are reported internally on a quarterly basis.
Other information on insurance risk More information about i risk management objectives and policies for mitigating insurance risk, ii terms and conditions of long-term insurance businesses, iii management of insurance risks life assurance, iv guarantees and options life assurance, and v general insurance risk, can be found at www.
g Sensitivity analysis life assurance Changes in key assumptions used to value insurance contracts would result in increases or decreases to the insurance contract provisions recorded, with impact on profit loss and or shareholders equity.
The effect of a change in assumption is mitigated by the offset partial or full to the bonus stabilisation reserve in the case of smoothed bonus products in South Africa.
182 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business The net increase or decrease to insurance contract provisions recorded at 31 December 2012 has been estimated as follows: % m m m emerging old mutual old mutual assumption change markets wealth Bermuda Mortality and morbidity rates assurance 10 317 2 Mortality rates annuities 10 52 Discontinuance rates 10 16 2 12 Expenses maintenance 10 64 2 Emerging Markets The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
The insurance contract liabilities recorded for the Emerging Market business are also impacted by the valuation discount rate assumed.
Lowering this rate by 1% with a corresponding reduction in the valuation inflation rate assumption would result in a net increase to the insurance contract liabilities, and decrease to profit, of 39 million 2011 restated: 42 million.
The 2011 figure is restated to allow for greater consistency as both the valuation discount rate and the valuation inflation rate are now reduced by 1% for this sensitivity in line with expected practice, where historically only the valuation discount rate was reduced with the inflation rate unchanged.
Consequently, the impact of this sensitivity is reduced as lower future expenses partially offset the increase in liabilities caused by the lower discount rate.
This impact is also calculated with no change in charges paid by policyholders.
It should be noted that where the assets and liabilities of a product are closely matched eg non-profit annuity business or where the impact of a lower valuation discount rate is hedged or partially hedged, the net effect has been shown since the asset movement fully or partially offsets the liability movement.
Old Mutual Wealth The changes in insurance contract liabilities shown are calculated independently using the specified increase or decrease to the rates, with no change in premiums paid by policyholders.
The assumption changes have no impact on the linked UK business.
Whole of Life is the main product group affected by the lapse assumption change.
This is because the policies have the longest duration and represent close to 91% of the reserve.
The main product groups impacted by the expense, mortality and morbidity sensitivities are Whole of Life and Accelerated Critical Illness.
In the Old Mutual Wealth business, non-linked liabilities are fairly well matched by gilts so that the net impact of a valuation interest rate change taking asset and liability movement into account is negligible.
Old Mutual Bermuda Lapses and partial withdrawals have the largest impact where increased activity reduces the guarantee portion of the business since less death and living benefit exposure is expected in the future.
Mortality plays a much smaller part in Old Mutual Bermuda since all the business is accumulation savings-type business.
Increased deaths do accelerate payment of guaranteed minimum death benefits but there is a comparable release of reserve on the maturity guarantee providing an offset about 82% of the variable annuity business has both death living benefits.
The impact of varying expense maintenance assumptions is zero for Old Mutual Bermuda as the deferred acquisition cost balance on which the sensitivity has an impact has now been written down to zero.
h Sensitivity analysis general insurance An increase of 10% in the average cost of claims would require the recognition of an additional loss of 40 million 2011: 36 million net of reinsurance.
Similarly, an increase of 10% in the ultimate number of claims would result in an additional loss of 40 million 2011: 36 million net of reinsurance.
The majority of the Groups general insurance contracts are classified as short-tailed, meaning that any claim is settled within a year after the loss date.
This contrasts with the long-tailed classes where the claims costs take longer to materialise and settle.
The Groups general insurance long-tailed business is generally limited to personal accident, third-party motor liability and some engineering classes.
In total the long-tail business comprises less than 5% of an average years claim costs.
i Reinsurance assets credit risk None of the Groups reinsurance assets are either past due or impaired.
Of the reinsurance assets shown in the statement of financial position all are considered investment grade with the exception of 134 million of unrated exposures 2011: 104 million.
Collateral is not taken against reinsurance assets or deposits held with reinsurers other than in limited circumstances.

Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Individual businesses separately maintain and manage their local liquidity requirements according to their business needs, within the overall liquidity framework established by Old Mutual plc.
The Group continues to meet Group and individual entity capital requirements, and day-to-day liquidity needs through the Groups available credit facilities.
Given the nature of the Groups investments and securities, generally speaking, liquid resources are readily available, as the Group holds large portfolios of highly marketable securities, for example equities, listed bonds, actively traded pooled investments and cash and cash equivalents.
Whilst most of the Groups policyholder and banking liabilities are generally repayable on demand, the Groups expectation is that policyholders and banking depositors will only require funds on an ongoing basis.
Cash resources and other liquid assets are maintained in the event of a need for additional liquidity.
Information on the nature of the investments and securities held is given in note E4.
The Groups existing revolving credit facility of 1.20 billion 2011: 1.20 billion does not mature until April 2016 2011: April 2016.
Details, together with information on the Groups borrowed funds, are given in note E9.
The key information reviewed by the Groups executive directors and Executive Committee, together with the Groups Capital Management Committee, is a detailed management report on the Groups and holding companys current and planned capital and liquidity position together with summary information on the current and planned liquidity positions of the Groups operating segments.
Forecasts are updated regularly based on new information received, and as part of the Groups annual business planning cycle.
The Group and holding companys liquidity and capital position and forecast are presented to the Old Mutual plc Board of directors on a regular basis.
Group operating segments are required, both in terms of their local requirements and in accordance with direction from the holding company, to establish their own processes for managing their liquidity and capital needs and these are subject to review by their local oversight functions, with representation from the Group.
Further information on liquidity and holding company cash flow is contained in other sections of this Annual Report.
The Group does not have material liquidity exposure to special purpose entities or investment funds.
The contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities are set out in the appropriate notes to the financial statements.
187 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 F: Other statement of financial position notes F1: Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill and goodwill impairment Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking is recognised as an asset at the date that control is achieved the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest in the acquiree if any over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously-held equity interest if any, this excess is recognised immediately in the income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least once annually.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On loss of control of a subsidiary undertaking, any attributable goodwill is included in the determination of any profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is allocated to one or more cash-generating units CGUs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.
The directors annually test for impairment of each CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, at a level that is no larger than that of the Groups identified operating segments for the purposes of segment reporting.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU or group of CGUs exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill are not reversed.
b Present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business The present value of acquired in-force for insurance and investment contract business is capitalised in the consolidated statement of financial position as an intangible asset.
The capitalised value is the present value of cash flows anticipated in the future from the relevant book of insurance and investment contract policies acquired.
This is calculated by performing a cash flow projection of the associated life assurance fund and book of in-force policies in order to estimate future after tax profits attributable to shareholders.
The valuation is based on actuarial principles taking into account future premium income, mortality, disease and surrender probabilities, together with future costs and investment returns on the assets supporting the fund.
These profits are discounted at a rate of return allowing for the risk of uncertainty of the future cash flows.
The key assumptions impacting the valuation are discount rate, future investment returns and the rate at which policies discontinue.
The asset is amortised over the expected profit recognition period on a systematic basis over the anticipated lives of the related contracts.
The amortisation charge is stated net of any unwind in the discount rate used to calculate the asset.
The recoverable amount of the asset is re-calculated at each reporting date and any impairment losses recognised accordingly.
c Other intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination Contractual banking and asset management customer relationships, relationships with distribution channels and similar intangible assets, acquired as a part of a business combination, are capitalised at their fair value, represented by the estimated net present value of the future cash flows from the relevant relationships acquired at the date of acquisition.
Brands and similar items acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at their fair value based on a relief from royalty valuation methodology.
Subsequent to initial recognition such acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as set out below: Distribution channels 10 years Customer relationships 10 years Brand 15 20 years The estimated life is re-evaluated on a regular basis.
d Internally developed software Internally developed software is amortised over its estimated useful life.
Such assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Software is recognised in the statement of financial position if, and only if, it is probable that the relevant future economic benefits attributable to the software will flow to the Group and its cost can be measured reliably.
Costs incurred in the research phase are expensed whereas costs incurred in the development phase are capitalised subject to meeting specific criteria, set out in the relevant accounting guidance.
The main criteria being that future economic benefits can be identified as a result of the development expenditure.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the relevant software, which range between two and five years.
188 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business e Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as incurred.
For properties reclassified during the year from property, plant and equipment to investment properties, any revaluation gain arising is initially recognised in the income statement to the extent that impairment losses were previously recognised.
Any residual excess is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Revaluation deficits are recognised in the revaluation reserve to the extent of previously recognised gains and any residual deficit is accounted for in the income statement.
Investment properties that are reclassified to owner-occupied property are revalued at the date of transfer, with any difference being taken to the income statement.

An impairment charge is recognised when the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value.
Long-Term Savings The CGUs within Long-Term Savings generate revenues through their life assurance and asset management businesses.
The value-in-use calculations for the life assurance operations are determined using the reported embedded value methodology plus a discounted cash flow calculation for the value of new business.
The value of new business represents the present value of future profits from expected new business.
Embedded value represents the shareholders interest in the life assurance business and is calculated in accordance with MCEV principles.
The methodology and significant assumptions underlying the determination of embedded value is disclosed in the supplementary information shown on pages 228 to 236.
The differences between the key assumptions applied in the current year and in the prior year are disclosed on pages 239 to 243.
The cash flows attributable to the value of new business are determined with reference to latest approved three-year business plans.
Projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using an inflation based growth assumption.
The value-in-use calculations for the asset management operations are similarly determined based on discounted cash flow models derived from the latest approved three-year business plans.
An additional two years projections beyond the plan period are extrapolated using inflation based growth rates.
The cash flows are discounted at economic profit rates applicable to each individual CGU.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for the Emerging Markets, Retail Europe and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs are as follows: The growth rate The rate used is an inflation based growth assumption, which varies by CGU and is based on external market factors particular to that CGU.
Emerging Markets applied the growth rate of 3.7% 2011: 3.4% to both its life assurance business and asset management business in Mexico and Colombia.
Old Mutual Wealth, which incorporates the previously separately reported Retail Europe, applied a weighted average calculation to determine the growth rate of 2.2% 2011: 2.7% The discount rate The applied rate used the relevant 10-year government bond rate as a starting point, which was adjusted for an equity market risk premium and other relevant risk adjustments, which were determined using market valuation models and other observable references.
Rates applied were 13.2% 2011: 13.1% for Emerging Markets, and 9.3% 2011: 12.7% for Old Mutual Wealth.
The directors are satisfied that any reasonable change in the assumptions would not cause the recoverable amounts of the Emerging Markets and Old Mutual Wealth CGUs to fall below their carrying amounts.
Nedbank The impairment test in respect of the Nedbank CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs carrying amount to its value-in-use.
Value-in-use has been determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation are the discount rate and growth rate, which are based on market factors relevant to that CGU.
The discount rate applied is approximately 11.2% 2011: 12.7%.
A 5.5% growth rate was applied to extrapolate cash flows for an additional two years beyond the three-year business plan period.
A terminal value, using the same growth rate, is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The directors are satisfied that a reasonable change in assumptions would not cause the recoverable amount of the goodwill to fall below the carrying amount.
US Asset Management The impairment test in respect of the USAMs CGU has been performed by comparing the CGUs carrying amount to its value-in-use determined using a discounted cash flow methodology.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations for USAM are as follows: The three year business plan and two further years have growth rate assumptions based on managements expectation of performance over this period.
A terminal value, using a long-term growth rate of 4.0% 2011: 4.0% is added for the value of cash flows beyond five years.
The assumed long-term growth rate was determined with reference to nominal historical gross domestic product GDP growth in the US, and the outlook for nominal GDP growth for the US The risk-adjusted discount rate applied was 12.0% 2011: 12.0%.
During 2011, the Group reduced the long-term growth rate for the purposes of the 2011 impairment test.
As a result of the change in the growth rate assumptions and the reduction in near term client cash flows experienced at the time, an impairment charge has been recognised to reflect the reduction in value-in-use for USAM with a charge of 264 million being recognised during the year-ended 31 December 2011.
No such impairment was raised during 2012.

There are no restrictions on property, plant and equipment title as a result of security pledges.
The revaluation of land and buildings relates to Long-Term Savings and to Nedbank.
In 2012 Long-Term Savings made revaluation gains of 3 million on land 2011: 3 million and 13 million 2011: 6 million on buildings, while Nedbank made revaluation gains of nil on land 2011: 5 million and 5 million on buildings 2011: 25 million.
For Long-Term Savings, land and buildings are valued as at 31 December each year by internal professional valuers and external valuations are obtained once every three years.
External professional valuers are used for Nedbank.
For both businesses the valuation methodology adopted is dependent upon the nature of the property.

This reflects the legal ownership of this business following the implementation for Black Economic Empowerment BEE schemes in 2005.
In accordance with IFRS accounting rules the shares issued for BEE purposes are deemed to be, in substance, options.
Therefore the effective ownership interest of the minorities reflected in arriving at profit after tax in the consolidated income statement is lower than that applied in arriving at adjusted operating profit after tax.
In 2012 the increase in adjusted operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests as a result of this was 25 million 2011: 22 million.

These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.

b Measurements and assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of share options granted is measured using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Share options are granted under a service and non-market based performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the share options granted.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.
The grant date for the UK and South African Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plan annual awards is deemed to be 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue.
As such the Group is required to estimate, at the reporting date, the number and fair value of the options that will be granted in the following year.
The fair value of awards expected to be granted in 2013 which will have an IFRS 2 grant date of 1 January 2012, is shown separately below.
The grant date for all other awards is the award issue date.
c Share-based payment arrangements relating to US Asset Management During the year ended 31 December 2012, US Asset Management had the following share based payment arrangements: Acadian Asset Management AAM Class B equity interests in AAM acquired by employees during 2007 entitled the participating employees to 28.57% of the earnings of AAM in excess of $120 million, and to a liquidation preference proportionate to their shareholding.
In consideration for the equity acquired, the participating employees agreed to forego a portion of existing long-term incentive payments owed.
The difference between the carrying amount of this consideration and the fair value of the interest acquired was treated as share-based compensation expense in 2007.
Fair value was determined based on the discounted projected future cash flows of AAM.
During 2011, the AAM plan was modified such that the threshold above which key employees participate in earnings was reduced to $75 million, and a feature was added such that participating employees may sell their equity back to Old Mutual at a fixed multiple of prior year earnings, subject to certain restrictions.
Participants are required to remain employed until 31 March 2013 to benefit from these amendments.
The difference in fair value between the modified AAM plan and the original AAM plan was $21 million at the time of modification, and the vested portion of $11 million is recognised as compensation expense during 2012.
As the AAM plan conforms to the form and operation of the OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans described below, new purchases and grants are classified to that category of arrangement from 2011 onwards.
201 Group financial statements notes to tHe consoliDateD financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2012 G: Other notes continued G2: Share-based payments continued c Share-based payment arrangements relating to US Asset Management continued IPO Incentive Plan During 2011, a stock-based compensation plan was implemented for certain key employees of US Asset Management in connection with the stated intention of exploring a potential initial public offering IPO of the business.
The plan is designed to reward participants for achievement of strategic objectives and metrics and value creation over the period leading up to an initial public offering, should one proceed.
The awards consist of a mix of cash, payable at completion of an IPO, and restricted shares in the newly-listed US entity, which would be granted upon completion of an IPO and vest rateably over 3 years from that date.
Should an IPO not proceed during the maximum term of the plan, the awards will be paid out in cash.
The value and quantity of the cash and share portions of the awards will vary until an IPO is completed or the plan is terminated, depending on the achievement of performance objectives, financial targets and potential IPO proceeds.
Accordingly, the awards are currently accounted for as a share-based payment liability, recognized over the vesting period and revalued at each period end for projected results of the performance conditions, with fair value-measured using a monte-carlo simulation.
The expense recognised during 2012 in relation to this plan was $2.3 million 2011: $1.3 million.
OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans Equity granted during the year to employees of firms participating in the OMAM Affiliate Equity Plan vests 3 to 5 years from the date of grant, conditional upon continued employment over this period.
Fair value was determined based on a multiple of prior year earnings.
Under the terms of the arrangements, participating employees may sell their equity back to Old Mutual which acts as a buyer of last resort at a fixed multiple of prior year earnings, subject to certain restrictions.
Accordingly, the schemes are accounted for as cash-settled share-based payments, despite the fact the initial purchase and or grants of equity are settled in equity instruments.
The following summarises the fair value of instruments purchased from and granted by US Asset Management during the year: Affiliate shares Total Affiliate share Affiliate share forfeited non-controlling Instruments granted and purchased during the year purchases grants bought back interest in affiliate Percentage of affiliate equity 2012 0.01% 1.97% 0.23 % 1.75% 2011 0.07% 3.88% 0.11 % 3.84% 1 Fair value of instruments 2012 $11.5m $11.5m 2011 $31m $31m 1 Represents fair value in excess of consideration granted for affiliate share purchases.
US Asset Management annual bonus awards The OMAM Affiliate Equity Plans are incorporated into annual bonus awards of employees at participating firms, which are to be settled partly in cash, and partly in equity.
The level of bonus is contingent upon current year financial and individual performance, therefore the vesting period for bonus equity to be granted during 2013 in respect of the 2012 financial year has been determined to commence from 1 January 2012.
It is anticipated that instruments with a fair value of US$11.1 million 2011: US$15.8 million and 2010: US$7.9 million will be granted during 2013 to firms participating in the OMAM Affiliate Equity Plan based on 2012 financial performance.
d Restricted share grants The following summarises the fair value of restricted shares granted by the Group during the year: Weighted average Instruments granted and purchased during the year Number granted fair value Shares in Old Mutual plc London Stock Exchange 2012 12,351,453 1.57 2011 13,429,616 1.44 Shares in Old Mutual plc Johannesburg Stock Exchange 2012 22,703,982 R19.35 2011 24,108,524 R15.16 Shares in Nedbank Ltd 2012 4,467,742 R158.11 2011 4,806,015 R134.64 The share price at measurement date was used to determine the fair value of the restricted shares.
Expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value where the holder of the restricted share is entitled to dividends throughout the vesting period.
e Annual bonus awards The UK and South Africa Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plans give rise to annual bonus awards.
The level of annual bonus awards is contingent upon the satisfactory completion of individual and company performance targets, measured over the financial year prior to the date the employees receive the award.
The accounting grant date for the South African and UK annual bonus plans other than the new joiner and newly qualified grants has therefore been determined as 1 January in the year prior to the date of issue of the grants.
202 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business The Group anticipates awards under the South African scheme of nil options 2011: nil and 9,337,461 restricted shares 2011: 15,983,524.
The options have been valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, using an at the money option assumption.
The restricted shares have been valued using a share price of R24.49 2011: R17.04.
The Group estimate of the total fair value of the annual bonus expected to be paid in the form of options and restricted shares under the UK Share Option and Deferred Delivery Plan is outlined below.
The fair value is determined by making an estimate of the level of bonus to be paid out following the attainment of personal and company performance conditions.

206 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financials How we What Where we have Our risks Financials we do are going performed How we govern our business Nedbank structured financing Historically the Groups South African banking business entered into structured-finance transactions with third parties using their tax bases.
In the majority of these transactions, the underlying third-party has contractually agreed to accept the risk of any tax being imposed by the South African Revenue Service SARS, although the obligation to pay rested in the first instance with the Group.
It would only be in limited cases, for example, where the credit quality of a client became doubtful, or where the client specifically contracted out of the repricing of additional taxes, that the recovery from a client could be less than the liability arising on assessment, in which case provisions would be raised.
Nedbank litigation There are a number of legal or potential claims against Nedbank and its subsidiary companies, the outcome of which cannot at present be foreseen.
The largest of these potential actions is a claim in the High Court for R1.3 billion against Nedbank by certain shareholders in Pinnacle Point Group Limited, alleging that Nedbank had a legal duty of care to them arising from a share swap transaction.
During 2011 further actions were instituted against Nedbank by other stakeholders relating to this same issue.
In early 2013 one of the claims by one of the shareholders, Property Promotions and Management Pty Ltd, for an amount of R147 million was dismissed by the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria.
Nedbank and its legal advisers remain of the opinion that the remaining claims are ambitious, and that the remaining claimants will have great difficulty succeeding.
Nedbank Securitisations The Group through Nedbank uses securitisation primarily as a funding diversification tool and to add flexibility in mitigating structural liquidity risk.
Nedbank currently has two active traditional securitisation transactions: Synthesis Funding Limited Synthesis, an asset-backed commercial paper ABCP programme launched in 2004: and GreenHouse Funding Pty Limited, Series 1 GreenHouse, a residential mortgage-backed securitisation programme launched in December 2007 restructured in November 2012.
Synthesis primarily invests in long-term rated bonds and offers capital market funding to South African corporates.
These assets are funded through the issuance of short-dated investment-grade commercial paper to institutional investors.
All the commercial paper issued by Synthesis is assigned the highest short-term RSA local-currency credit rating by Fitch, and is listed on JSE Limited.
Within GreenHouse Series 1, R2.0 billion of home loans originated by Nedbank, was securitised in 2007.
The notes issued to finance the purchase of the home loan portfolio were assigned credit ratings by both Fitch and Moodys and listed on JSE Limited.
During 2010 Fitch placed the GreenHouse notes on rating watch negative as a result of changes in its rating criteria for SA RMBS transactions.
On 22 May 2012 Fitch affirmed the rating of the notes, with a stable outlook, and withdrew the rating of the subordinated loan.
GreenHouse was restructured and refinanced on 19 November 2012 as a static amortising structure.
The proceeds from the refinance of this transaction, through the issuance of new notes and subordinated loans, was utilised to repay the R1.3 billion existing notes and subordinated loans upon their scheduled maturity, and to acquire additional home loans of approximately R795 million.
The newly issued senior notes, which have been rated by Fitch and listed on the JSE Limited, were placed with third-party investors and the junior notes and subordinated loans retained by the Group.
The home loans transferred to GreenHouse have continued to be recognised as financial assets.
GreenHouse will direct all capital repayments received on the home loan portfolio to the noteholders.
The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets, stated at the amount of the Groups continuing involvement where 1 appropriate, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset in the statement of financial position: Carrying amount of assets Associated liabilities At 31 December 2012 2011 2012 2011 Loans and advances to customers 2 Residential mortgage loans 96 116 161 132 Other financial assets Corporate and bank paper 155 116 Other securities 189 199 Commercial paper 345 320 Total 440 431 506 452 This table presents the gross balances within the securitisation schemes and does not reflect any eliminations of intercompany and cash balances held by the various securitisation vehicles.

At 31 December 2011 the assets and liabilities of the Groups Finnish branch were also shown as held for sale in the financial statements, being 1,156 million and 1,119 million respectively.
The disposals of both of these businesses were completed during the year and therefore no assets or liabilities are shown as held for sale at 31 December 2012.
In addition to the disposal groups held for sale, the Group also had additional non-current assets for sale of 42 million 2011: 22 million and non-current liabilities of 3 million 2011: 9 million.
H3: Contingent liabilities in respect of the disposal of US Life Following its disposal in April 2011 of US Life to the Harbinger group Harbinger, the Group has retained certain residual commitments and contingent liabilities relating to that business.
These arise from sale warranties and indemnities that are typical in transactions of this nature, including in respect of certain litigation including class actions and regulatory enforcement actions arising from events that occurred before completion of the sale.
The residual commitments are in effect for varying periods of time.
The sale agreement contemplated that Harbinger would establish certain internal reinsurance arrangements after completion, which were subject to regulatory approval.
If such regulatory approval was not forthcoming, there was potential for a reduction in the purchase price of US Life of up to a maximum of US$50 million.
In July 2012, Harbinger filed a lawsuit against the Group, claiming payment of a purchase price adjustment of US$50 million.
The Group has filed its defence and is vigorously defending this claim.
In view of the ongoing uncertainty and the Groups current assessment of this claim, the Group has not raised a provision against this exposure.
