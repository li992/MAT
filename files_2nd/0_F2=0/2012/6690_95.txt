The LTIP provides for Executive Directors and certain other senior employees to be awarded nil cost shares in the Company conditional on specified performance conditions being met over a period of three years.
Refer to the Directors Remuneration Report for further details of the LTIP.
The expense recognised for the LTIP during the year to 30 June 2012 was 0.5m 2011: 0.4m.
The fair value of LTIP options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The inputs to the model used for the options granted in the year to 30 June 2012 were: 2012 2011 % per annum % per annum The Go-Ahead Group Future share price volatility 33.0 38.0 Transport sector comparator Future share price volatility n a 35.0 52.0 Correlation between companies n a 55.0 FTSE Mid-250 index comparator Future share price volatility 35.0 40.0 Correlation between companies 30.0 20.0 The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 11.72 2011: 11.83.
Awards made before July 2011 were subject to performance conditions based on the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance measured against two comparator groups the transport sector comparator group and a group comprising the FTSE 250 excluding investment trusts.
Following the acquisition of Arriva plc on 31 August 2010, the transport sector now comprises only three companies.
Accordingly the previous policy of having a relative TSR versus a transport peer group is no longer feasible.
Therefore new financial and strategic performance conditions have been introduced, in addition to the continued use of a revised relative TSR comparator group for awards made after July 2011.
The following table shows the number of share options for the LTIP: 2012 2011 No.
