Distribution Distribution publisher distribution contracts are not amortised due to the very long-term nature of the business in theUK.
The Group distributes to approximately 45% of the UK retail market and has only one major competitor.
In such circumstances the Board considers that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the contracts are expected to generate cash flows and have been determined to have an indefinite life.
These contracts are, however, tested annually for impairment using similar criteria to the goodwill test.
Value in use calculations are based on Board approved three year plans extrapolated to a 5-year period and keeping the growth rates flat.
This reflects managements specific business expectations for 2016 and 2017.
Net margin assumptions are based on historic experience.
Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each CGU.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonably possible change in key assumptions.
There is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
