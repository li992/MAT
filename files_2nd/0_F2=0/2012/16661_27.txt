Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Vesuvius plc Vesuvius or the Company formerly Vesuvius Technologies plc is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group is set out in the Business Review referenced on page 93 and its registered address is shown on page 160.
Basis of preparation 2.1 Basis of accounting The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and, with the exception of defined benefits pension plans and derivative financial instruments, under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2.2 Group reorganisation and demerger On 14 December 2012, Cookson Group plc Cookson effected a group reorganisation and Vesuvius plc became the new holding company for Cookson via a Scheme of Arrangement.
Vesuvius, which had been incorporated as Vesuvius Technologies plc on 17 September 2012, replaced Cookson renamed Cookson Group Limited as the parent company of the Cookson group from this date.
On 14 December 2012 shareholders were given one ordinary share of Vesuvius for every share of Cookson held on that date.
Application was made to the UK Listing Authority and to the London Stock Exchange for the issued share capital of Vesuvius to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges market for listed securities as from 17 December 2012.
Also on 17 December 2012, Vesuvius effected a court approved capital reduction to create distributable reserves.
The Scheme of Arrangement was accounted for using the principles of reverse acquisition accounting contained within IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
In these consolidated financial statements, the transaction to interpose the new holding company, Vesuvius, has been presented as though Cookson acquired Vesuvius.
On 19 December 2012, the businesses of Cooksons former Performance Materials division were demerged from Vesuvius and thereafter became the Alent group.
This was achieved by the reduction of capital and repayment of capital to the shareholders of Vesuvius, the latter being satisfied by the transfer of the former Performance Materials division to Alent plc, in consideration for which Alent plc issued the entirety of its shares to Vesuvius shareholders.
In these financial statements, the effect of adopting the principles of reverse acquisition accounting for the Scheme of Arrangement results in a continuation of the consolidated financial statements of Cookson, now renamed Vesuvius.
As a consequence of this, the financial statements of Vesuvius include the full results of the Alent group of companies up to the date of the demerger becoming effective.
In preparing the segmental disclosure of the total results of Vesuvius for 2012, the following approach has been applied: i The costs incurred by Vesuvius within its central headquarters in London have been allocated in full between the underlying trading results of Cooksons three divisions and therefore between continuing and discontinued operations in arriving at the results for Vesuvius as a whole.
ii As Cookson Group Limited remained with Vesuvius after the demerger, all of the borrowings entered into by Cookson in the period up to the date of demerger have been treated as belonging to Vesuvius in these consolidated financial statements, with the consequence that all of the finance costs relating to those Cookson borrowings have been reported as finance costs of Vesuvius.
Borrowings and borrowing costs relating to local debt arrangements established by individual Cookson Group companies other than Cookson Group plc have been reported according to whether they are now part of the Alent or Vesuvius group structure.
This approach has also been applied to financial assets net cash and the related finance income.
iii Vesuvius has established similar policies to those of Cookson for managing the financial risks to which its Group activities are exposed, including the market risk resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates: and liquidity risk, being the risk that Vesuvius has insufficient debt facilities to finance its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities.
In managing these risks, Vesuvius uses derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps.
As the borrowings entered into by Cookson in the period up to the date of demerger have been treated as belonging to Vesuvius in these consolidated financial statements, any hedging activity relating to those borrowings is similarly reported within these financial statements.

Basis of preparation continued 2.2 Group reorganisation and demerger continued iv Tax charges in the consolidated financial statements have been determined based on the tax charges recorded by Vesuvius companies in local statutory accounts, together with certain adjustments relating to those entities made for Group consolidation purposes.
The tax charges recorded in the Group income statement have been affected by the tax arrangements within the former Cookson Group and are not necessarily representative of the tax charges that would have been reported had Vesuvius been an independent group throughout the period covered by these financial statements, nor of tax charges that may arise in the future.
2.3 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups interest therein.
Noncontrolling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the noncontrolling interests share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
2.4 Going concern The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts for the Group for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of the 2012 financial statements.
These forecasts reflect an assessment of current and future end-market conditions and their impact on the Groups future trading performance.
The forecasts show that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the Companys financial covenants.
On the basis of the exercise described above and the Groups available committed debt facilities, the Directors consider that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt a going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
2.5 Functional and presentation currency The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 30.1.
2.6 Disclosure of exceptional items as Separately reported items IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed.
It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entitys financial performance.
In accordance with IAS 1, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement, within the column entitled Separately reported items, the effect of any components of financial performance for which the Directors consider separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation.
Such items may include, inter alia, amortisation charges relating to intangible assets, the financial effect of major restructuring activity, profits or losses relating to non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, finance costs, profits or losses arising on business disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Groups results either due to their size or nature.

Basis of preparation continued 2.7 New and revised IFRS During the year a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
A number of other new and amended IFRS were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2013, none of which are likely to have a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 Goodwill and other intangible assets The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 2012, further details of which are given in note 19, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2 Employee benefits The Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to current and former employees.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
These assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used could affect the Groups profit and financial position.
3.3 Liability reserves Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.

Critical judgements in applying accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued 3.4 Taxation a Current tax Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based upon the Directors interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
Non-GAAP financial measures The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
4.1 Headline Headline performance is from continuing operations excluding Alent and the Precious Metals Processing division and before items reported separately on the face of the income statement.
4.2 Underlying Underlying performance is adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates and business acquisitions, disposals and closures.
4.3 Return on sales Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue.
4.4 Trading profit Trading profit is defined as profit from operations before exceptional items.
The Directors believe that trading profit is an important measure of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
4.5 Headline profit before tax Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Groups share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net finance costs associated with ordinary activities.
4.6 Headline earnings per share Headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with ordinary activities and profit attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

Non-GAAP financial measures continued 4.7 Free cash flow Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
4.8 Average working capital to sales ratio The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the year.
Average working capital comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months.
4.9 EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges.
4.10 Net interest Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be exceptional.
4.11 Interest cover Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
4.12 Net debt Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
4.13 Net debt to EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
4.14 Return on net assets Return on net assets RONA is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.

Segment information The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which can be found in note 4.
5.1 Accounting policy a Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
b Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
5.2 Business segments Operating segments for continuing operations For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into two main business segments: Steel and Foundry and the senior executive management of each of these business segments reports to the Chief Executive of the Group.
It is the Vesuvius Board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments.
The information used by the Vesuvius Board to review performance and determine resource allocation between the business segments is presented with the Groups activities segmented between the two business segments, Steel and Foundry.
Taking into account the basis on which the Groups activities are reported to the Vesuvius Board, the Directors believe that these two business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Groups results.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 17 to 27.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material.
Trading profit includes items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations in 2012 include the results of the Alent group of companies for the period up to 19 December 2012, when they were demerged from Vesuvius, together with the results of the US Precious Metals Processing business for the period up to 1 May 2012 when it was sold and the European Precious Metals Processing business, which was held for sale as at 31 December 2012, for the whole of the year.
Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.

Restructuring charges The restructuring charge for the year from continuing operations was 57.0m 2011: 7.0m and arose in connection with initiatives that included redundancy programmes, the downsizing or closure of facilities, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the rationalisation of product lines.
Of the total charge, 46.3m arose in connection with the actions taken during 2012 to downsize the Solar Crucibles operations of the Foundry division.
Of the total charges of 57.0m, 40.8m represented non-cash asset write-offs, with the remaining 16.2m of total charges comprising cash-related costs in respect of redundancy and other cost-reduction initiatives.
The net tax credit attributable to these restructuring charges was 4.6m 2011: 1.4m.
Cash costs of 11.4m 2011: 9.3m were incurred in the year in respect of the restructuring initiatives commenced both in 2012 and in prior years, leaving provisions made but unspent of 17.1m note 35 as at 31 December 2012 2011: 12.0m, of which 5.6m relates to future costs in respect of leases expiring between one and ten years.
Demerger costs The cash costs associated with the preparation and execution of the demerger of the Alent group of businesses from Cookson Group plc, to the extent that they were allocated to Vesuvius, have been separately reported in the income statement.
Costs totalling 15.7m have been charged in the year, primarily relating to professional adviser fees for financial, audit, accounting, legal and pensions advice.
Fees in connection with the negotiated changes to the former Cookson debt arrangements in order to provide Vesuvius with ongoing borrowing facilities were 2.0m and have, as required by IFRS, been capitalised against the associated borrowings and are being amortised over the expected life of those debt arrangements.
Tax-related costs of 11.4m were incurred in connection with the transactions necessary to reorganise the legal entity structure of the former Cookson group of companies so as to facilitate the demerger.
In addition to the costs charged to the income statement noted above, a cash injection of 38.0m was agreed with the UK pension plan Trustee to be paid into the UK defined benefit plan in mitigation for the loss of strength in the employer covenant which resulted from the demerger as a consequence of the two UK Alent participating employers leaving the plan.
The mitigation payment did not represent a charge to the income statement under IFRS, but is reported as an additional employer funding contribution to the UK pension plan.
Of the total 38.0m, 34.0m was paid in December 2012, with the remaining 4.0m paid in January 2013.

The costs written off related to the old facility that had been due to expire in 2012.
Income tax 12.1 Accounting policy Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
com Stock Code: VSVS 117 21796-04 2 April 2013 5:52 PM Proof 3 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.
Income tax continued 12.1 Accounting policy continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Income tax continued 12.2 Income tax costs continued Tax credited in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to 14.8m 2011: 11.9m charge, all of which related to net actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits plans.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2012, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.
Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 12.1.

Income tax continued 12.4 Deferred tax continued Tax loss carry-forwards and other temporary differences of 7.0m 2011: 1.6m were recognised by subsidiaries reporting a loss in 2011 or 2012.
On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries, the Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2012 was 336.6m 2011: 483.7m, as analysed below.
In accordance with the accounting policy in note 12.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable.

From 1 April 2012, the UK corporation tax rate reduced to 24% from 25%.
A further UK corporation tax rate reduction to 23% was substantially enacted on 3 July 2012 and will have effect from 1 April 2013.
It is the UK Governments intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 22% by 2014, although this has not yet been substantively enacted under IFRS.
Accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 23%.
The impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets from 4.7m to 6.7m.

Therefore the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding has been calculated using the number of ordinary shares issued by Vesuvius plc at the date of reorganisation, 17 December 2012, and adjusted for movements in the number of ordinary shares of Cookson Group plc from the beginning of each period prior to the reorganisation and movements in the number of ordinary shares outstanding from the reorganisation date to 31 December 2012 using the actual number of ordinary shares in Vesuvius plc outstanding during that period.
For the purposes of calculating diluted and diluted headline EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted to include the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to the Companys share-based payment plans.
Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease EPS, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
In addition to the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had no 2011: 0.2m outstanding options and share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted and diluted headline EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented.

Property, plant and equipment 17.1 Accounting policy Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between 10 and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years other between 5 and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year-end.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
As described in note 19.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement.

Intangible assets Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
18.1 Accounting policy a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

Intangible assets continued 18.3 Analysis of goodwill by cash-generating unit CGU Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has three CGUs: the Steel division, the Foundry division and the Precious Metals Processing division.
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.
The goodwill attributable to the Precious Metals Processing CGU has been fully impaired and consequently the amount recognised in the Group balance sheet is nil 2011: nil.

The assets acquired and their remaining useful lives are shown below.
Net book value as at Remaining 31 December useful life 2012 years m Foseco customer relationships useful life: 20 years 15.3 86.7 trade name useful life: 20 years 15.3 55.3 intellectual property rights useful life: 10 years 5.3 42.1 Total 184.1 19.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets 19.1 Accounting policy At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of each CGU, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of the associated goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period.
The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.

Impairment of tangible and intangible assets continued 19.2 Key assumptions The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, growth rates and discount rates.
Return on sales assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key endmarkets of steel production and foundry castings: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2011: 2.5% has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Groups end-markets and external forecasts.
The Groups projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used for the Steel CGU was 12.2% and for the Foundry CGU was 15.4%.
In the prior year, the Steel and Foundry CGUs were reported as a combined Engineered Ceramics CGU, for which the pre-tax discount rate was 14.9%.
19.3 Goodwill impairment In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2012, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2012.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.
Trade and other receivables 20.1 Accounting policy Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.

Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

Inventories 21.1 Accounting policy Inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in, first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.

Derivative financial instruments 22.1 Accounting policy The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, forward commodity contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in note 30.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments continued 22.1 Accounting policy continued Cash flow hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Net investment hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity, and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the Group income statement.

Financial risk management 30.1 Accounting policy a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement: and ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pounds sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used: and iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
30.2 Financial risk factors The Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Groups financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency profile of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the FX swaps, is shown in the table below.

Financial risk management continued 30.2 Financial risk factors continued Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings.
Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had $250.0m 153.8m of US Private Placement Loan Notes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate of interest, representing just over a third of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.
The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings and net debt is detailed in the tables below.

Financial risk management continued 30.2 Financial risk factors continued Based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 1.4m 2011: 0.1m and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 1.4m 2011: 0.1m.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 9.2m 2011: 10.9m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 9.8m 2011: 11.7m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
The level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 578.8m 2011: 883.7m, of which 157.7m 2011: 339.5m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in April 2016.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan Notes USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 425.0m 2011: 600.0m.
The USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 December 2012 and amounted to 153.8m $250.0m, of which $110.0m is repayable in 2017 and $140.0m in 2020.
The syndicated bank facility was renegotiated at the time of the Cookson demerger and the Vesuvius facility was reduced to a 425.0m revolving credit facility from the 600.0m in place at December 2011.
The facility is repayable in April 2016.
The maturity analysis of the Groups gross borrowings is shown in the tables below.

Financial risk management continued 30.3 Capital management The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios and RONA note 4.
The Groups objectives when managing its capital are: to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities: to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt: to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to investors: and to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial Review on page 55.
Employee benefits 31.1 Accounting policy The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The expense for the Groups defined benefit plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 31.7.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of profit from operations.
31.2 Group post-retirement plans The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefit and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS19.
The Groups principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and the US, the benefits of which are based upon the final pensionable salaries of plan members.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefits pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
a Defined benefit pension plans UK The Groups main defined benefit pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual.
Following the demerger of Cookson Group plc, the UK Plan remains with Vesuvius and the Alent employees who participated in the UK Plan ceased to participate with effect from the demerger.
In order to ensure there was a clean break for Alent companies, the pension liabilities held in respect of their employees in the UK Plan were discharged in full by apportioning the pension liabilities of the Alent participating employers to Vesuvius, combined with a mitigation payment into the UK Plan to compensate for the loss of support from the Alent participating employers, which reduced the financial covenant of the employers supporting the UK Plan.
The mitigation payment agreed with the UK Plan Trustee was equal to approximately 25% of the UK Plans Section 75 deficit calculated as at completion of the demerger and amounted to 38.0m, of which 34.0m was paid in December 2012 and 4.0m in January 2013. www.

Employee benefits continued 31.2 Group post-retirement plans continued A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2009.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 401.9m and this represented a funding level of 88% of the accrued plan benefits at the time of 456.4m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 589.0m, representing a funding level of 68%.
Under the rules of the UK Plan, the Trustee has the power to set the funding contributions, having consulted with the Company.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a schedule of contributions under which the Company is making top-up payments of 7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at eliminating the 2009 full actuarial valuation deficit in the UK Plan by that date.
The level of top-up payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plans next triennial valuation as at 31 December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013.
The Directors expect that the valuation will show further improvement to the funding position of the UK Plan.
As at 31 December 2012, the funding ratio calculated on an IAS19 basis was 105%, i. e. a funding surplus.
During 2011, the deferred members of the UK Plan were offered the opportunity to transfer their benefits out of the UK Plan to another arrangement of their choice at an enhanced value.
The offer of enhanced transfer values closed during the first half of 2012.
In total some 550 members took up the offer and this has eliminated the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of the 50m of liabilities transferred out of the UK Plan representing around 10% of total UK Plan liabilities.
The impact on the IAS19 valuation of UK pension liabilities of the transfers agreed up to 31 December 2011, were reflected in the results for 2011 as an exceptional charge of 5.9m.
The impact of transfers agreed after 1 January 2012 was a charge of 0.5m and, not being material, has been reported in 2012 in arriving at trading profit.
On 19 July 2012, the UK Plan Trustee announced that it had entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement with Pension Insurance Corporation PIC to insure approximately 60% of the UK Plans total liabilities.
Under this arrangement, the UK Plan Trustee paid an insurance premium of 318.8m to PIC, wholly from the assets of the UK Plan, which will secure a stream of income exactly matching future ongoing pension payments.
The insured liabilities cover the UK Plans pensioner members as at 30 June 2012, who comprise some 3,350 members out of a total UK Plan membership of 5,900.
This arrangement eliminates the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of these liabilities.
For plan funding purposes, the UK Plans pensioner liabilities are valued using more prudent assumptions than those required under IAS19 for accounting purposes.
On a funding basis sometimes called the economic or ongoing basis the insurance premium paid to PIC represented some 10m less than the amount reserved in the UK Plan against these liabilities.
This means that the funding level of the UK Plan the measure which determines the level of additional contributions required to be made by Vesuvius improved by some 10m as a result of the buy-in.
On an accounting basis, the pensioner liabilities are valued using a higher discount rate as required by IAS19, which produces a much lower valuation of those liabilities.
As a consequence, the accounting valuation of the insurance contract compared with the actual premium paid to PIC results in a reduction in the asset portfolio valuation of some 50m.
IAS19 requires this loss to be reported in the Group statement of comprehensive income, not the income statement.
Post buy-in, the UK Plan now carries an asset in the form of the insurance contract, which is valued in both the funding and IAS19 valuations at an amount which matches exactly that of the liabilities which it covers thereby removing any funding or balance sheet volatility relating to this part of the UK Plans liabilities.
Therefore, the only risks remaining in the UK Plan relate to deferred members.
The Group continues to fund the UK Plan on the basis of the funding valuation.
In December 2012, an extension to the PIC buy-in agreement was signed, under which the UK Plan Trustee agrees to transfer to PIC all new pensioner liabilities arising from July 2012 to December 2015 for a premium payment by the UK Plan which is calculated to be consistent with the pricing terms of the original buy-in agreement, but reflecting changes in market conditions and differences in the duration of the liabilities transferred.
The agreement covers up to 30m of liabilities, with the future premium payments to be met from the existing assets of the UK Plan.

Employee benefits continued 31.2 Group post-retirement plans continued b Defined benefit pension plans US The Group has a number of defined benefit pension plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
The Groups principal US defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members.
Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2011.
At that date the market value of the plan assets was 81.3m, representing a funding level of 71% of funded accrued plan benefits at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 114.5m.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
Following an offer to Vesuvius US deferred members which closed in August 2012, 1,070 members 67% accepted a lump sum payment in full and final settlement of the Groups pension liability to them.
This has therefore eliminated the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk for Vesuvius in respect of the $36m 22m of liabilities involved, for a payment out of the pension plan assets of $28m 17m.
c Defined benefit pension plans Germany The Group has a number of defined benefit pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
d Defined contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 17.0m 2011: 17.7m and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.
31.3 Post-retirement liability valuation The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German defined benefit pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS All table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2011 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The latter CMI tables are expected to replace the use of the Cohort improvement factors widely used since 2002.
For the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected 64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA.
The Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the Heubeck-Richttafein 2005G mortality tables.

The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the Aon Hewitt AA-rated corporate bond yield in conjunction with the most recent projected cash flow data relating to the UK Plan liabilities: the US discount rate is based on the Citigroup pension discount curve: and the German discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 10 year euro corporates AA index.
The assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 0.7pts lower than RPI-based inflation.
The expected asset return is the Companys expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns: based on the risk-free yield available by following a buy-and-hold investment strategy in government bonds: with returns for other bonds and equities estimated based on observed historic long-term strategic risk premia.
These assumptions do not take account of the relative valuation of markets or of market momentum.
c Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
As stated above, during 2012 the UK Plan entered into a pension insurance buy-in agreement which eliminates the inflation, interest rate, investment and longevity risk in respect of the pensioner liabilities covered by the agreement.
Therefore, for the liabilities covered by this buyin agreement, which represent some 60% of the total liabilities of the UK Plan, any changes in the valuation assumptions which impact the value of those liabilities, also impacts on the associated annuity assets in an equal and opposite way, thereby fully mitigating the valuation risk.
This is also reflected in the following table.

Employee benefits continued 31.4 Defined benefit obligation The liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans for IAS19 accounting purposes are measured by discounting the best estimate of the future cash flows to be paid out by the plans using the projected unit method, in which the calculation of plan liabilities makes allowance, where appropriate, for projected increases in benefit-related earnings.
The average duration of the obligations to which the liabilities of the Groups principal pension plans relate is 17 years for the UK and Germany and 13 years for the US.

In addition, the UK Plan holds a liability driven investment portfolio of financial derivative contracts which reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall materially relative to the value of its economic liabilities.

Administration costs charged within ordinary finance costs in 2012 were 1.6m.
In accordance with IAS19 Revised, which takes effect from 1 January 2013, these costs would have instead been charged within trading profit and the net finance charge relating to the Groups post-retirement benefit plans would have been increased by 1.2m, resulting in an overall reduction of the net finance charge by 0.4m.

Leases 34.1 Accounting policy Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
34.2 Operating lease commitments 2012 2011 m m The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: Not later than one year 9.5 17.1 Later than one year and not later than five years 18.8 41.4 Later than five years 10.1 44.7 Total operating lease commitments 38.4 103.2 The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 was not material.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted to 24.2m 2011: 25.6m.
Provisions 35.1 Accounting policy Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

Provisions continued 35.2 Analysis of provisions continued Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2012 of 61.3m 2011: 80.6m, 31.8m 2011: 55.7m is recognised in the Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and 29.5m 2011: 24.9m within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
The balance of 17.1m as at 31 December 2012 comprises 5.6m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between one and ten years, and 11.5m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its realisation is virtually certain.
As at 31 December 2012, 10.2m 2011: 8.3m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 7.9m 2011: 6.3m is non-current.
The amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions.
Other components of the charge, such as asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item.
Acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures, net of cash acquired During the year, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries for a total consideration of 32.3m, of which 29.5m was paid in cash and 2.8m is contingent upon future performance, 0.8m of which was paid in the current period.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 18.3m of which 4.6m was cash.
Goodwill arising on these acquisitions amounted to 14.0m note 18.
The 26.1m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, comprised: 29.5m paid for current year acquisitions, 0.4m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions, 0.8m of deferred consideration paid in respect of current year acquisitions less 4.6m of cash acquired with current year acquisitions.
Off-balance sheet arrangements In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors include: inventory held either under precious metal consignment arrangements or on behalf of customers for processing note 21 : future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases note 34 : and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group balance sheet included 18.6m 2011: 41.7m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2012, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 0.5m 2011: 1.8m.

Contingent liabilities Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 3.4m 2011: 4.1m.
Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 11 to the Company financial statements.
Vesuvius has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of Vesuvius subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and the Directors are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Certain of Vesuvius subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by Vesuvius.
These suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
To date, Vesuvius is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or results of operations.
Cookson Precious Metals Ltd, a subsidiary of Vesuvius, was engaged in transactions involving the purchase of scrap platinum between August 2007 and October 2009.
Vesuvius has been informed by HMRC that, in HMRCs view, certain external third-parties within the supply chain for those transactions deliberately failed to account to HMRC for VAT.
Such fraud is commonly known as Missing Trader Intra-Community Fraud.
As a consequence of any fraudulent actions of those third-parties, HMRC may argue that the ability of Vesuvius to retain VAT recovered on the relevant transactions should be limited.
HMRCs investigations are ongoing and the Vesuvius subsidiary has to date been notified of VAT loss in the supply chain relating to the trades in the relevant period of approximately 11m.
The VAT relating to these trades has been repaid to Vesuvius pending completion of that investigation.
Should the tax authorities seek to reclaim any part of this amount then, in the light of legal advice received by Vesuvius, the Directors intend to pursue the remedies available to Vesuvius to retain the VAT payment.
If Vesuvius were to fail to retain the entirety of such VAT, this loss, along with any interest and penalties which theoretically could be up to 100% but which, in practice, are expected to be significantly less, could have a material adverse effect on Vesuvius financial position or profitability.
Certain subsidiary companies of Vesuvius plc and Alent plc are defendants in two actions, brought by MacDermid incorporated in the United States, which are pending in the Connecticut Superior Court and arising out of corporate activity involving the parties in the autumn of 2006.
The first action was commenced in 2009 and the second action was commenced in August 2012.
MacDermid claims damages of approximately $62m, plus punitive or exemplary damages, costs and interest which are currently unquantifiable.
Both Vesuvius and Alent believe these claims have no merit and are vigorously defending these actions.
Each of Vesuvius and Alent anticipate filing motions for summary judgement in both cases by mid-2013 and, if any claims remain pending decisions on those motions, a trial in the first action is anticipated in the second half of 2013 or early 2014.
Any liability relating to the MacDermid claim arising following the demerger of Cookson Group will be split equally between Alent plc and Vesuvius plc.
Principal subsidiaries and joint ventures Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Vesuvius plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in note 5 to the Company financial statements.
Related parties All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
Events after the balance sheet date On 27 March 2013, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Heimerle Meule GmbH, a subsidiary of L. Possehl & Co, mbH Possehl to sell the European Precious Metals Processing business for a consideration of 56.8m.
The cash consideration will be subject to closing balance sheet adjustments.
Completion, which is expected by the end of the first half of 2013, will be subject to conditions including approval by the European Commission and by the Supervisory Board of Possehl.
As at 31 December 2012, the net assets of the European Precious Metals Processing business of 19.4m were classified as held for sale in the Group balance sheet note 23. www.
