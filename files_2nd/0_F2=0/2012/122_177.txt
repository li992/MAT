This period has been reviewed at the statement of financial position date and remains appropriate.

Impairment tests for goodwill and brands For impairment testing, goodwill and brands are allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each CGU are: Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 28 January 2012 000 000 000 000 Rubicon operating unit 21,036 42,986 1,689 65,711 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 8,902 Total 22,938 49,986 1,689 74,613 Customer Goodwill Brands relationships Total At 29 January 2011 000 000 000 000 Rubicon operating unit 21,036 42,986 1,942 65,964 Strathmore operating unit 1,902 7,000 74 8,976 Total 22,938 49,986 2,016 74,940 82 A. G. BArr p. l. c. Annual report and Accounts 2012 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management which cover a three year period.
Cash flows beyond the three years are extrapolated using the growth rates and other key assumptions as stated below: Key assumptions 2012 2011 Gross Growth Discount Gross Growth Discount margin rate rate margin rate rate % % % % % % Rubicon operating unit 41.34 2.25 9.09 37.18 2.25 9.54 Strathmore operating unit 30.75 2.25 9.09 29.00 2.25 9.54 The Rubicon operating unit can be further allocated across Carbonates and Still drinks and water when determining the CGU required for impairment testing.
No impairment was identified through this allocation.
The budgeted gross margin is based on past performance and managements expectation of market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of pre-tax cost of capital adjusted for the specific risks impacting on each operating unit.
The estimated pre-tax cost of capital is a benchmark for the Group provided by an independent third party.
Advertising and promotional costs are included in the breakdown, using latest annual budgets for the year to 26 January 2013 and projected costs thereafter.
Sensitivity analysis was carried out on the above calculations to review possible levels of impairment after adjusting discount rates.
At 12%, the highest discount rate that could reasonably possibly be thought to apply, neither of the CGUs were impaired.
Whilst cash flow projections used within the impairment reviews are subject to inherent uncertainty, changes within reason to the key assumptions applied in assessing the value in use calculation would not result in a change in the conclusions reached.
