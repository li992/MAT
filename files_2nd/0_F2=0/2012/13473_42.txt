The directors have reviewed the Companys existing accounting policies and consider that they are consistent with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 Accounting Policies and with last year.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
b Deferred tax Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
There are no unprovided amounts relating to deferred tax.
c Currency translation The Companys local or functional currency is the US dollar.
Transactions denominated in other currencies, including the issue of shares, are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Exchange rates used are consistent with the rates used by the Group as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements see note 42.
Exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
e Financial guarantees Obligations for financial guarantees issued by the Company to other Group companies are reflected as liabilities at fair value, in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments Measurement.
Such obligations result in corresponding increases in the carrying value of amounts owed by subsidiaries.
Payments received are set off against the asset recognised which is initially recorded at fair value.
f Share based payments The fair value of the grant is recognised as an addition to the cost of the investment in the subsidiary in which the relevant employees work.
The fair value is recognised over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding adjustment to the profit and loss account reserve.
Payments received from the Companys subsidiaries in respect of these share based payments result in a credit to reduce the cost of the investment.
The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award eg Total Shareholder Return.
When market prices are not available, the Company uses fair values provided by independent actuaries using a lattice-based option valuation model.
Non market vesting conditions eg earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date, at which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued.
No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
g Revenue recognition Interest is accounted for on the accruals basis.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
h Dividends Dividends payable are recognised when they meet the criteria for a present obligation ie when they have been approved.
i Treasury shares The consideration paid for shares repurchased by the Company and held as treasury shares is recognised as a reduction in shareholders funds through the profit and loss account reserve.
j Related party disclosures The Company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related party disclosures from presenting related-party transactions with entities that are part of the Rio Tinto Group or investees of the Rio Tinto plc group.
