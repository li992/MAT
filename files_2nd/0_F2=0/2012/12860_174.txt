Credit risk is limited as a result of the high percentage of revenue derived from UK and US defence and other government agencies.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no credit provision in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts is required.
As at 31 March 2012 the Group carried a provision for doubtful debts of 4.0m 2011: 5.8m.
Other receivables increased significantly from 2011 due to inclusion of a 78m receivable from MOD gross of VAT in respect of the recovery of prior year restructuring costs.
