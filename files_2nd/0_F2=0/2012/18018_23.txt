COM 89 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING Management has determined the operating segments based on reports reviewed by the Chief Executive, who is deemed to be the chief operating decision maker.
The principal performance measures have been identified as net rental income and net asset value.
For management and reporting purposes the Group is organised into five operating divisions being Covent Garden, Earls Court & Olympia, The Great Capital Partnership, China and Other.
The Other segment primarily constitutes the business unit historically known as Opportunities and other head office companies.
Due to actions taken by the fund manager who controls the divestment decisions pertaining to the Groups interests in China, this segment has been presented separately as the segments results in 2011 exceeded the quantitative threshold requiring separate disclosure.
The Earls Court & Olympia segment also includes the Groups interest in The Empress State Limited Partnership which holds the Empress State building adjacent to the Groups property at Earls Court.
The Groups operating segments derive their revenue primarily from rental income from lessees, with the exception of Earls Court & Olympia whose revenue primarily represents exhibition income.
Unallocated expenses consist primarily of costs incurred centrally which are neither directly nor meaningfully attributable to individual segments.

6 PROFIT ON SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES On 9 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in The Brewery by EC&O Limited for a consideration of 2.0 million, resulting in a profit of 1.1 million.
On 29 February 2012, the Group disposed of its shareholding in Covent Garden Restaurants Limited for a consideration of 1.0 million, resulting in a profit of 0.6 million.
7 LOSS OF CONTROL OF FORMER SUBSIDIARY On 30 August 2012, the Group completed a joint venture arrangement with the Kwok Family Interests.
The venture, to develop land interests at Seagrave Road in West London, resulted in the loss of control of the former subsidiary Seagrave Road GP Limited, and the disposal of a 50 per cent limited partnership interest in Seagrave Road LP.
Consideration received of 7.5 million and associated costs resulted in a net loss of 1.0 million.
On the date control was lost, the 50 per cent investment retained was re-measured and reflected at fair value.
The disposal of the net assets of the partnership together with reorganisation of internal funding previously fully provided by the Group and now reorganised to reflect the respective 50:50 partnership interests resulted in a net cash inflow of 65.4 million.
8 WRITE BACK OF IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER RECEIVABLES Following an impairment review of loan notes receivable by the Group, a write back of a previously recognised charge of 0.6 million was recognised in 2012.
The write back was calculated with reference to the market value of certain property assets that the Group would have priority over in the event of default.
There was no impairment adjustment in 2011.

Revaluation surplus not recognised in deferred tax of 43.5 million arises from the Groups decision to early adopt the new IAS 12 provisions which changed the basis on which deferred tax on investment properties is calculated in the accounts.
The amendment introduces a presumption that investment property assets accounted for under IAS 40 Investment Property will normally be recovered through sale rather than use.
Based on the Groups holding structure for a number of its investment properties, the majority of the fair valuation movements in the year are not reflected in the deferred tax calculation and so appear as a permanent timing difference in the tax reconciliation.
Early adoption of the new IAS 12 provisions has resulted in a restatement of the 2011 amount for this item and the removal of Utilisation of losses brought carried forward.
Further amendments to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 Budget which included changes to the main rates of UK corporation tax.
The main rate of corporation tax decreased from 26 per cent to 24 per cent from 1 April 2012.
The Budget will reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24 per cent to 23 per cent from 1 April 2013 with a further 1 per cent reduction in rate from 1 April 2014 resulting in a final corporation tax rate of 22 per cent.

The fair value of the Groups investment and development properties as at 31 December 2012 was determined by independent, appropriately qualified external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court & Olympia excluding Empress State, and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups investment and development property.
The valuation conforms with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Professional Standards.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent or business profitability, likely incentives offered to tenants, construction costs, forecast growth rates, yields and sales prices based on known market transactions for similar properties while taking account of tenure and structural condition.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
When considering the highest and best a valuer will consider, on a property by property basis, the highest valuation which will include its actual and potential uses given current market conditions.
Where the highest and best use differs from the existing use, the valuer will consider the cost and the likelihood of achieving and implementing this change in arriving at its valuation.
There are often restrictions on both freehold and leasehold investment property which could have a material impact on the realisation of these assets.
Most significant of these occur when a credit facility is in place or when planning permission, lease extension or renegotiation of use are required as is the case currently regarding Earls Court.
These restrictions are factored in to the propertys valuation by the external valuer.

COM 105 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed to a variety of risks arising from the Groups operations: market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate paid at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
Interest rate swaptions provide the Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the financial review on pages 36 to 41.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the drawn borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2012 2012 2011 2011 m m m m Borrowings 3.8 344.2 8.9 544.4 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 344.2 344.2 515.1 515.1 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 348.0 524.0 29.3 Interest rate protection 100.0% 94.6% Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 3.6 per cent 2011: 4.5 per cent.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of 9.8 million 2011: 10.0 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of 9.8 million 2011: 10.0 million.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, such a movement would have a very limited effect on Group cash flow overall.
b Foreign exchange risk The Groups largest exposure to foreign exchange movements is in respect of its investments in the Chinese investment fund which is denominated in US dollars.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge foreign currency exposures that are less than 15 per cent of its net assets.
Foreign currency exposures in excess of this amount, as far as practicable, will be hedged by borrowing in foreign currencies and through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2012 by 0.4 million 2011: 1.8 million.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by 0.4 million 2011: 2.0 million.
This represents managements assessment of possible changes in exchange rates.
106 OUR STRATEGIC REPORT HOW WE GOVERN OUR BUSINESS OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED c Market price risk The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment properties, interest rates and economic sentiment.
A one per cent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and development property in the income statement by 15.9 million.
A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and development property would decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the income statement by 15.9 million.
For further information on covenant positions on investment and development property refer to page 126.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entities ability to meet the relevant facilities financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
A detailed analysis of the Groups financial covenant position is set out on page 126.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

COM 107 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result, deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2012 is 3.1 million 2011: 2.0 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Groups policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are fully provided against.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability concerns.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2012 2011 m m Up to 90 days 8.4 15.5 Over 90 days 0.4 Trade receivables 8.8 15.5 Also included within receivables are 4.0 million 2011: 3.4 million of loan notes.
All loan notes have been reviewed for potential impairment and are considered to be receivable as at the year end.
In 2012 there was an impairment write back on trade receivables of 0.1 million 2011: an impairment of 0.3 million.
This is considered to be an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.
Relationships are maintained with a number of Tier 1 institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

COM 109 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Capital structure The Group seeks to enhance shareholder value both by investing in the business so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest cover ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 45 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These are discussed in the financial review on pages 36 to 41.

The minimum interest coverage ratio for the year was 134 per cent and occurred on 1 January 2012.
Fair value estimation The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels are defined as follows: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices.
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

All of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments are unlisted equity investments.
These investments are externally valued quarterly, with valuations performed by examining expected yields of the underlying property and expectations relating to the property market and wider economic factors.
COM 111 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 29 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of investment properties at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time of sale.
For UK properties the relevant tax rate will be 23 per cent 2011: 25 per cent.
The IASB released an amendment to IAS 12, 'Income taxes', on 20 December 2010, which provides an exception to the principles in the existing standard for measuring deferred tax assets or liabilities when investment property is measured at fair value.
The amendment applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 with early adoption permitted.
For the purposes of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 the Group has early adopted the new IAS 12 provision.
Early adoption requires retrospective application of the amendments resulting in deferred tax being recalculated under the new provisions resulting in the restatement of the 2011 deferred tax balance on investment & development properties and Group losses.
Under the new IAS 12 provisions the recognised deferred tax liability on investment properties is 1.8 million at 31 December 2012 2011 restated: 3.3 million.
The calculation is on a disposal basis and includes indexation relief, the Group's holding structure and the application of the REIT provisions to disposals occurring 2 years or more post exit 7 May 2012.
The Group's contingent tax liability is nil 2011: nil.
This is after taking into account the availability of Group losses, indexation relief and the rebasing of properties formerly within the REIT regime to their May 2010 Market Value.
A disposal of the Group's trading properties at their market value as per note 16 would result in a corporation tax charge to the Group of 9.0 million 24 per cent of 37.5 million.

Performance Share Plan Market value options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Performance Share Plan PSP.
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.
All awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: a the Companys total return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of the Company, Intu Properties plc formally Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and b the Companys total shareholder return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
For full vesting of the awards made to date to be achieved, the target is median 2.5 per cent per annum.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
For full vesting of the awards made to date to be achieved, the target is median 4 per cent per annum.
For performance at median, 33 per cent of an award will vest.
For intermediate performance above median, vesting will be on a straight-line basis from 33 per cent to 100 per cent.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance.
Where events occur which cause the Committee to consider that the performance conditions have become inappropriate or impractical, the Committee may amend, relax or waive such conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that the conditions after the changes are not materially tougher or easier to achieve than was intended at the outset.
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
In general, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
A schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme in 2011: therefore the company may now make a proportion of awards as approved options.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2012 were exercisable between nil pence and 176.33 pence and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of eight years and are exercisable between 2013 and 2022.

The standard table used by the Scheme in both the current and comparative periods is S1 PXA, CMI 125%, Year of Birth.
The table makes allowance for future improvements in longevity based on the year of birth of each member.
2012 2011 The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: Life expectancy at age 65 current age 45 Male 89.0 88.8 Female 91.2 91.0 Life expectancy at age 65 current age 65 Male 87.2 86.9 Female 89.3 89.0 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the Scheme, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected annual return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
As a result, a discount rate of 4.1 per cent has been applied as at 31 December 2012 2011: 4.7 per cent.
