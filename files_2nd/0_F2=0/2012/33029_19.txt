The 2012 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $259m arising from a number of tax settlements including settlement of a transfer pricing matter, partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2011 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $520m arising from a number of tax settlements, partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2010 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies and double tax relief partially offset by a benefit of $342m arising from a number of tax settlements and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2012 prior period deferred tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $102m arising from a number of tax settlements including settlement of a transfer pricing matter and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2011 and 2010 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a reclassification from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double tax relief if distributed as dividends.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and branches for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised totalled approximately $8,655m at 31 December 2012 2011: $9,155m: 2010: $16,768m.
Factors affecting future tax charges As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
It is the UK governments intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax to 21% by 2014.
In 2012, the UK government also enacted legislation as part of its programme of corporate tax reforms including the introduction of a patent box regime, under which UK profits arising from certain UK owned patents will be subject to a reduced rate of UK Statutory Corporation Tax effective 1 April 2013.
The Swedish government has enacted legislation to reduce the Sweden Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.
Tax reconciliation to UK statutory rate The table below reconciles the UK statutory tax charge to the Groups total tax charge.
2012 2011 2010 $m $m $m Profit before tax 7,718 12,367 10,977 Notional taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5%: 2010: 28% 1,891 3,277 3,074 Differences in effective overseas tax rates 83 340 333 1 Deferred tax credit relating to reduction in Sweden, UK and other tax rates 271 53 21 Unrecognised deferred tax asset 18 5 Items not deductible for tax purposes 116 71 12 Items not chargeable for tax purposes 29 32 36 Non-taxable gain arising from the Astra Tech disposal 389 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 215 188 200 Total tax charge for the year 1,391 2,351 2,896 1 The 2012 item relates to the reduction in the Sweden Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013 and the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 25% the tax rate which was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2012 as at 31 December 2011 to the tax rate of 23% effective from 1 April 2013.
The 2011 item relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 27% the tax rate which was substantively enacted as effective from 1 April 2011 as at 31 December 2010 to the tax rate of 25% effective from 1 April 2012.
The 2010 item relates to the reduction in the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
The tax rate of 18% for the year ended 31 December 2012 is lower than the UK Statutory Corporation Tax rate of 24.5% mainly as aresult of the $230m adjustment to deferred tax balances following substantive enactment of a reduction in the Sweden Statutory Corporation Tax rate from 26.3% to 22% effective 1 January 2013, the $240m release of a tax provision following the settlement of atransfer pricing matter and the difference in effective overseas tax rates as discussed below.
Excluding the effects of the one-off benefits totalling $470m mentioned above, the tax rate is 24.1%.
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK.
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Groups overall tax charge is shown above.
Profits arising from our manufacturing operation in Puerto Rico are granted special status and are taxed at a reduced rate compared with the normal rate of tax in that territory under a tax incentive grant that expires in 2016.

154 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
Our pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
All of these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
We do not manage these individual functional areas separately.
We consider that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
The SET also includes Finance, HR and Corporate Affairs, Compliance and General Counsel representation.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is at SET level as a whole.
Where necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise a wide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in the form of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Portfolio Investment Board to facilitate a Group-wide single combined discovery and development strategy.
The Groups acquisitions in the biologics area, MedImmune and Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc CAT, have been integrated into the existing management structure of AstraZeneca both for allocation of resources and for assessment and monitoring of performance purposes.
As such, although biologics is a relatively new technological area for the Group, it does not operate as a separate operating segment.
Geographic areas The tables below show information by geographic area and, for revenue and property, plant and equipment, material countries.
The figures show the revenue, operating profit and profit before tax made by companies located in that area country, together with segment assets, segment assets acquired, net operating assets and property, plant and equipment owned by the same companies: export sales and the related profit are included in the area country where the legal entity resides and from which those sales were made.
Intra-Group pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
2 Non-current assets exclude deferred tax assets and derivative financial instruments.
3 Included in Assets acquired are those assets that are expected to be used during more than one period property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets.
4 Net operating assets exclude short-term investments, cash, short-term borrowings, loans, derivative financial instruments, retirement benefit obligations and non-operating receivables and payables.
5 Assets acquired in 2012 include those related to Amylin and Ardea see Notes 9 and 22.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years which is considered by the Board as a reasonable period given the long development and life-cycle of a medicine.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, our knowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2012, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 2011: 10%: 2010: 10%.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2012 and 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The remaining $149m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights includes a charge of $285m following the termination of development of the investigational compound olaparib for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer.
The 2011 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies.
The remaining $117m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The 2010 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the withdrawal of the biological licence application pending at the FDA for motavizumab $445m and the termination of the lesogaberan development $128m and other development projects in the year.
The 2010 impairment of other intangibles chiefly results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of research and development activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected cash flows over aperiod reflecting the patent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2012, 2011 and 2010 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.

160 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 9 Intangible assets continued Collaboration with BMS on Amylin products On 8 August 2012, BMS completed its acquisition of Amylin.
On that date, AstraZeneca and BMS entered into collaboration arrangements, based substantially on the framework of the existing diabetes alliance, regarding the development and commercialisation of Amylins portfolio of products.
Under the terms of the collaboration, the companies will jointly undertake the global selling and marketing activities in relation to the collaboration products.
BMS will undertake all manufacturing activities with AstraZeneca receiving collaboration product at cost.
Profits and losses arising from the collaboration will be shared equally.
The total consideration for AstraZenecas participation in the collaboration is $3.7bn, including an amount of $135m relating to an option of AstraZeneca contained in the collaboration agreement to acquire certain additional governance rights in respect of the collaboration.
The Group notified BMS of its decision to exercise the option in August 2012 and the balance of $135m will be payable once applicable anti-trust and competition approvals are received by AstraZeneca.
The Group expects to make this payment in the first half of 2013.
Upon such payment, the additional governance rights of AstraZeneca granted by the option will become legally effective.
AstraZeneca considers that the key strategic and financial decisions over which the collaboration agreement and the governance rights that are subject to the option grant joint control, represent the activities most relevant in affecting the success of the collaboration.
AstraZeneca accounts for the collaboration as a jointly controlled operation.
The Group has recognised a 50% share of collaboration revenues amounting to $128m, cost of sales of $36m and other costs, excluding amortisation, of $133m, in its income statement from9 August 2012.
An amount of $165m was owed to BMS under this arrangement, recorded within trade and other payables, at31December 2012.
AstraZenecas payment to BMS for its participation in the collaboration primarily results in the purchase of intangible assets, valued at $3,358m, related to the collaboration products: Byetta exenatide injection and Bydureon exenatide extended-release for injectable suspension exenatide 2mg powder and solvent for prolonged release suspension for injection that are approved for use in both the US and Europe, Symlin pramlinitide acetate injection that is approved for use in the US, and metreleptin, a leptin analogue currently under review at the US Food and Drug Administration FDA for the treatment of diabetes and or  in patients with rare forms of inherited or acquired lipodystrophy.
In addition, a prepayment of $0.4bn has been recognised representing payments in advance for collaboration products.
Arrangements with Merck In 1982, Astra set up a joint venture with Merck & Co. Inc. now Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co. Inc. that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough Merck for the purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products in the US.
In 1998, this joint venture was restructured the Restructuring.
Under the agreements relating to the Restructuring the Agreements, a US limited partnership the Partnership was formed, in which Merck is the limited partner and AstraZeneca is the general partner, and AstraZeneca obtained control of the joint ventures business subject to certain limited partner and other rights held by Merck and its affiliates.
These rights provide Merck with safeguards over the activities of the Partnership and place limitations on AstraZenecas commercial freedom to operate.
The Agreements provide, in part, for: Annual contingent payments: and Termination arrangements which cause Merck to relinquish its interests in AstraZenecas products and activities in stages, some of which are mandatory and others optional.
The termination arrangements and payments include: the Advance Payment the Partial Retirement the True-Up the Loan Note Receivable the First Option the Second Option.
AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Mercks interests in the Partnership and Agreement products including Mercks rights to contingent payments.
Once all payments are made, AstraZeneca will have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market.
AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all of the termination arrangements arise from: The substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered after the merger of Astra and Zeneca in 1999: and Enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products that have already been launched for example, Prilosec, Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand and those that are in development.
Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments and other cost efficiencies, together with the strategic advantages of increased freedom to operate.
The intangible assets relating to purchased product rights are subject to impairment testing and would be partially or wholly impaired if a product is withdrawn or if activity in any of the affected therapy areas is significantly curtailed.
Annual Contingent Payments AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales of certain of its products in the US the contingent payments on the Agreement products.
Contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised and consummated as discussed under Second Option below.
Contingent payments on all other agreement products have ceased as discussed under First Option below.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 161 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 9 Intangible assets continued Advance Payment The merger between Astra and Zeneca in 1999 triggered the first step in the termination arrangements.
Merck relinquished all rights, including contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger.
As a result, AstraZeneca now has rights to such products and is relieved of potential obligations to Merck and restrictions in respect of those products including annual contingent payments, affording AstraZeneca substantial freedom to exploit the products as it sees fit.
At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment of $967m was made.
The Advance Payment has been accounted for as an intangible asset and is being amortised over 20 years.
Although the rights obtained apply in perpetuity, the period of amortisation of 20 years is used to reflect the typical timescale of development and marketing of a product.
Partial Retirement, True-Up and Loan Note Receivable On 17 March 2008, AstraZeneca made a net cash payment to Merck of approximately $2.6bn in connection with the Partial Retirement, the True-Up and the Loan Note Receivable.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in certain AstraZeneca products including Pulmicort, Rhinocort, Symbicort and Toprol-XL, AstraZeneca ceasing contingent payments on these products and AstraZeneca obtaining the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Respiratory therapy area.
Intangible assets of $994m were recognised at the time with the balance of the net payment $1,656m representing payments on account for future product rights associated with the First Option and the Second Option as detailed below.
These non-refundable deposits were classified as intangible assets.
First Option On 26 February 2010, AstraZeneca exercised the First Option.
Payment of $647m to Merck was made on 30 April 2010.
This payment resulted in AstraZeneca acquiring Mercks interests in products covered by the First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and certain products in development at the time principally Brilinta and lesogaberan: development of lesogaberan subsequently was discontinued.
Also on 30 April 2010, contingent payments on these products ceased with respect to periods after this date and AstraZeneca obtained the ability to exploit these products and other opportunities in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
These rights were valued at $1,829m and were recognised as intangible assets from 26 February 2010 $1,182m having been transferred from non-refundable deposits to supplement the payment of $647m to Merck.
Of these rights, $689m was allocated to contingent payment relief and $1,140m to intangible assets reflecting the ability to fully exploit the products in the Cardiovascular and Neuroscience Therapy Areas.
The remaining non-refundable deposits of $474m relate to benefits that would be secured upon AstraZeneca exercising the Second Option.
Second Option The Agreements provided that AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Mercks interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the limited partner and other rights referred to above.
Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Mercks interests in Prilosec and Nexium in the US.
This option was exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined annual sales of the two products fell below a minimum amount.
On 26 June 2012, AstraZeneca and Merck agreed to amend certain provisions of the Agreements with respect to the Second Option.
The principal areas covered by the amendments are a change in the timing for AstraZeneca to exercise the Second Option, and agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain aspects of the option exercise price.
Under the amended Agreements, Merck has granted to AstraZeneca a new Second Option exercisable by AstraZeneca between 1 March 2014 and 30 April 2014, with closing on 30 June 2014.
Options exercisable in 2017 or if combined annual sales fall below a minimum amount also remain available to AstraZeneca.
In addition to this revised timing for the Second Option, AstraZeneca and Merck have also reached agreement on the valuation methodology for setting certain components of the option exercise price for a 2014 exercise.
In lieu of third-party appraisals, the valuation for a 2014 exercise is now a fixed sum of $327m, based on a shared view by AstraZeneca and Merck of the forecasts for sales of Nexium and Prilosec in the US market.
The agreed amount that would be payable on 30 June 2014 is subject to a true-up in 2018 that replaces a shared forecast with actual sales for the period from closing in 2014 to June 2018.
In addition, the exercise price for the Second Option also includes a multiple of ten times Mercks average 1% annual profit allocation in the Partnership for the three years prior to exercise.
AstraZeneca currently expects this amount to be around $80m.
The component of the exercise price of the Second Option that includes the net present value of up to 5% of future US sales of Vimovo, with the precise amount dependent on anannual sales threshold that has not yet been achieved and the timing of the option exercise, will continue.
AstraZeneca believes that the amendments provide a greater degree of certainty to the valuation of the Second Option that is preferable to the previous arrangements and, barring unforeseen circumstances, AstraZeneca now intends to exercise the Second Option in 2014.
Under the amendments, if AstraZeneca exercises in 2014, Mercks existing rights to manufacture Nexium and Prilosec would cease upon closing.
In connection with the amendments, Merck also granted AstraZeneca flexibility to exploit certain commercial opportunities with respect to Nexium.
AstraZeneca now considers that exercise of the Second Option is virtually certain.
This judgement is supported by managements view that: AstraZeneca is fully committed to exercising the Second Option in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances: external announcements of that intention constructively oblige AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014, barring unforeseen circumstances: and the Second Option price is highly favourable, giving economic compulsion for AstraZeneca to exercise in 2014.
As such, AstraZeneca has applied an accounting treatment to reflect the Second Option as if the date of exercise were 26 June 2012 the date of amendment of the Agreements, resulting in liabilities to Merck of approximately $1.5bn $1.1bn of which will be paid by way of monthly contingent payments between 1 July 2012 and 30 June 2014 and the balance as a lump sum on 30 June 2014, and a corresponding increase to intangible assets, from that date.
These intangible assets, and the $474m from the First Option detailed above, in aggregate, reflect the value of the ability to exploit opportunities in the Gastrointestinal Therapy Area and relief from contingent payments.

2 Instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss include the US dollar 5.4% callable bond repayable in 2014 and the US dollar 7% guaranteed debentures repayable in 2023.
3 Included within borrowings held at amortised cost are amounts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations of $1,551m 2011: $1,505m: 2010: $1,528m held at amortised cost.
The fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value, this falls within the Level 1 valuation method as defined in Note 10.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
A loss of $10m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss, due to decreased credit risk.
A gain of $34m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Groups Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Loans and borrowings 0.6% to 2.0% 0.9% to 2.3% 0.7% to 4.0% AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 165 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 15 Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate swaps included in instruments designated at fair value if related to debt designated at fair value or instruments in a fair value hedge relationship if formally designated as in a fair value hedge relationship, cross-currency swaps included in instruments designated in net investment hedges and forward foreign exchange contracts included below in otherderivatives.

None of the derivatives have been reclassified in the year.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates at current year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
The majority of forward foreign exchange contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The interest rates used to discount future cash flows for fair value adjustments, where applicable, are based on market swap curves at the reporting date, and were as follows: 2012 2011 2010 Derivatives 0.6% to 2.0% 0.9% to 2.3% 0.7% to 4.0% 16 Trade and other payables 2012 2011 2010 $m $m $m Current liabilities Trade payables 2,449 2,155 2,257 Value added and payroll taxes and social security 231 343 323 Rebates and chargebacks 2,486 3,285 2,839 Accruals 3,200 2,474 2,297 Other payables 855 718 945 9,221 8,975 8,661 Non-current liabilities Accruals 710 113 104 Other payables 291 272 269 1,001 385 373 With the exception of a payable of $nil 2011: $nil: 2010: $50m held within other payables, that arose on the acquisition of Novexel and the subsequent transaction with Forest, and which is held at fair value see Note 22, all other financial liabilities are held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised cost with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The Novexel-related payable falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 10.

18 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which may from time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles 97% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2012 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries, the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general, it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish to amend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 167 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 18 Post-retirement benefits continued AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based on the expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present, this puts a different, lower value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2010.
The next valuation is due at 31 March 2013.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the UK Pension Fund to target a level of assets in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the UK Pension Fund.
The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 3,129m $4,832m equivalent, representing 79% of the funds actuarially assessed liabilities Technical Provisions.
The Company agreed to fund the shortfall by making payments of 72.5m $112m a year until 31 December 2011 and then lump sum payments totalling 715m $1,103m.
The first of these lump sum payments of 180m $278m was paid into the UK Pension Fund inDecember 2011 from existing investments held in escrow for the Pension Fund.
A further 300m $463m was paid into the UK Pension Fund during January 2012 from existing investments held in escrow and the balance will be paid in due course.
This is in addition to the contributions required to meet the ongoing benefits accruing in the region of 24m $37m per annum.
In 2011, 132m $213m was paid into the escrow account and a further 230m $355m was paid in during January 2012.
At31 December 2012, 462m $748m of escrow fund assets are included within other investments see Note 10.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the Technical Provisions, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 are as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum.
During the first half of 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The defined benefit fund remains open to existing members and employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will retain a deferred pension in addition to being offered membership in a new Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
The amendment to the UK defined benefit fund to freeze pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension obligations.
The majority of members opted to remain in the defined benefit fund and continue benefit accrual with frozen pensionable pay.
In accordance with IAS 19, the scheme obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
The resulting credit of $693m was recognised in profit in 2010.
Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2012 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 92% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside of the UK.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations were $1,917m and plan assets were $1,679m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations were estimated toamount to $1,889m and plan assets were $1,125m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2012, when plan obligations amounted to$355mand plan assets were $23m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service cost during the year ending 31 December 2013 to the four main countries will be $537m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2012, some 3,528 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 8,893 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice, these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2012 was $16m 2011: $12m: 2010: $18m.
Plan assets were $301m and plan obligations were $363m at 31 December 2012.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits under IAS 19.
168 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 18 Post-retirement benefits continued Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2012.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2012 2011 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.2% 3.2% 2.3% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9% 1.1% 3.1% 0.9% Discount rate 4.5% 3.6% 4.8% 4.1% Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 7.5% 7.4% 7.5% 7.4% Bonds 4.2% 3.3% 4.5% 3.8% Others 2.8% 4.0% 2.8% 3.8% Rate of increase in medical costs initial rate 10.0% 8.2% 10.0% 9.0% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax payable by the plan.
The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2012 and members expected to retire in 2032 2011: 2011 and 2031 respectively.
Life expectancy assumption for a male member retiring at age 65 Country 2012 2032 2011 2031 UK 23.1 24.8 22.9 24.7 US 20.1 21.5 20.0 21.4 Sweden 20.4 22.4 20.4 22.4 Germany 18.6 21.3 18.3 21.0 Post-retirement scheme deficit The assets and obligations of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group at 31 December 2012, as calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits, are shown below.
The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

22 Acquisitions and disposals 2012 acquisitions Ardea On 19 June 2012, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Ardea.
Ardea is a US San Diego, California based biotechnology company focused on the development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of serious diseases.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Ardeas shares for cash consideration of $1,268m.
The acquisition strengthens our research and development capabilities in the respiratory and inflammation therapy area.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill.
In the case of the acquisition of Ardea, this goodwill is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant among these is the premium attributable to a highlyskilled workforce and established experience in the field of gout.
Ardeas results have been consolidated into the Groups results from 20 June 2012.
For the period from acquisition to 31 December 2012, Ardeas revenues were immaterial, in the context of the Groups revenue, and its loss after tax was $43m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period 1 January 2012, on a pro forma basis, the revenue of the combined Group for 2012 would have been unchanged and the profit after tax would have been $6,245m.
This pro forma information has been prepared taking into account any amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2012 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.

On the loss of control, the Group derecognised the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary.
The surplus arising on the loss of control is recognised in profit.
Astra Techs results were consolidated for the period until disposal and contributed $386m in 2011 2010: $535m in revenue and $16m in 2011 2010: $55m in profit after tax.

2010 acquisitions Novexel On 3 March 2010, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Novexel.
Novexel is a research company focused on the infection therapy area and is based in France.
This acquisition strengthens our research capabilities in the infection therapy area.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Novexels shares for an upfront consideration of $427m: with additional consideration of up to $75m becoming payable to Novexel shareholders on the completion of certain development milestones.
At both the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2010, the fair value of this contingent consideration was $50m.
For the ten month period post-acquisition to the end of 2010 and the full 2010 year, Novexel had no revenues and its loss was immaterial.

These antibiotic combinations utilise Novexels novel investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor NXL-104 to overcome antibiotic resistance and treat the increasing number of infections resistant to existing therapies.
In addition, Forest acquired rights to CAZ-104 in North America and bought down payment obligations to Novexel in relation to CEF-104 from previous existing licence arrangements.
In consideration for these rights, Forest paid Novexel, then an AstraZeneca Group company, a sum of $210m on 3 March 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by AstraZeneca.
This consideration is equivalent to the fair value attributed on acquisition to those assets and hence there was no profit impact from this divestment.
In 2011, the contingent consideration of $50m became fully payable.
The fair value of the remaining contingent consideration arising on the Novexel acquisition is $nil.
174 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, finance leases, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only to offset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 20, debt Note 14 and cash Note 13.
For the foreseeable future, the Board will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
The Boards distribution policy comprises a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
The Board regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy and in 2012 decided to suspend share repurchases in order to retain strategic flexibility.
In addition, we are restating our dividend cover target in terms of reported earnings adjusted for restructuring costs, intangible asset amortisation and impairments and other items as determined by the Group, and are targeting two times cover on this measure.
The Groups net funds position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has decreased from $2,849m at the beginning of the year to a net debt position of $1,369m at 31 December 2012 as a result of reduced operating cash inflows, substantial investment activities and share repurchases in 2012, offset by reduced tax cash outflows and fixed deposits maturing in the year.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding, taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Group is assigned short-term credit ratings of P-1 by Moodys and A-1 by Standard and Poors.
The Groups long-term credit rating is A1 negative outlook by Moodys and AAstable outlook by Standard and Poors.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $7,701m, fixed deposits of $46m, less overdrafts of $105m at 31 December 2012, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3.0bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2012, the Group has issued $1,551m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $7,796m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of $3.0bn mature in April 2017 and were undrawn at 31 December 2012.

It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2012, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.8bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014, and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2012 or 2011.
At 31 December 2012, swaps with a notional value of $0.75bn were designated in fair value hedge relationships and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated as fair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 146.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US dollar liquidity funds earning floating rates of interest.
176 AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 Overview Strategy Performance Corporate Governance Financial Statements Additional Information 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 62% of Group external sales in 2012 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally, based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of Swedish krona SEK, pounds sterling GBP, euro EUR, Australian dollar AUD, Canadian dollar CAD, Japanese yen JPY, Romanian leu RON and Russian ruble RUB.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2012, 5.4% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 9.6% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to profit.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
During 2012, the Group entered into a cross-currency swap to convert $750m of the 1.95% 2019 maturing bond into fixed Japanese yen debt.
This instrument was designated in a net investment hedge against the foreign currency risk of the Groups Japanese yen net assets.
Fair value movements on the revaluation of the cross-currency swap are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness would be taken to profit.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
The table below sets out the principal foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2012, 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 along with the underlying gross exposure as defined above.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 177 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
For long-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2012, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2012, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $30m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2012, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the 2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.

Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2012 was $6,589m invested in five US dollar AAA-rated liquidity funds.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2012 was $230m 2011: $21m: 2010: $13m.

AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2012 179 Financial Statements |Notes to the Group Financial Statements 24 Employee costs and share plans for employees continued The Directors believe that, together with the basic salary system, the Groups employee incentive schemes provide competitive and market-related packages to motivate employees.
They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.
Bonus plans The AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan Employees of participating AstraZeneca UK companies are invited to participate in this bonus plan, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses in respect of performance during 2012 will be paid in cash, as they were in 2011 and 2010.
The Company also offers UK employees the opportunity to buy Partnership Shares Ordinary Shares.
Employees may invest up to 1,500 over a 12 month accumulation period and purchase Partnership Shares in the Company with the total proceeds at the end of the period.
The purchase price for the shares is the lower of the price at the beginning or the end of the 12 month period.
In 2010, the Company introduced a Matching Share element in respect of Partnership Shares, the first award of which was made in 2011.
Partnership Shares and Matching Shares are held in the HM Revenue & Customs HMRCapproved All-Employee Share Plan.
At the Companys AGM in 2002, shareholders approved the issue of new shares for the purposes of the All-Employee Share Plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme This scheme is a performance bonus scheme for Directors and senior employees who do not participate in the AstraZeneca UK Performance Bonus Plan.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash and reflect both corporate and individual performance measures.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to reduce or withhold bonuses if business performance falls sufficiently short of expectations in any year such as to make the payment of bonuses inappropriate.
The AstraZeneca Deferred Bonus Plan This plan was introduced in 2006 and is used to defer a portion of the bonus earned under the AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme into Ordinary Shares in the Company for a period of three years.
The plan currently operates only in respect of Executive Directors and members of the SET.
Awards of shares under this plan are typically made in February each year, the first award having been made in February 2006.
Sweden In Sweden, an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid 50% into a fund investing in AstraZeneca equities and 50% in cash.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme, the AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan all operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee short-term or annual performance bonus plans in operation to differentiate and reward strong individual performance.
Annual bonuses are paid in cash.
There is also one senior staff long-term incentive scheme, under which 76 participants may be eligible for awards granted as AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market or funded via a share trust.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan and the AstraZeneca Global Restricted Stock Plan operate in respect of relevant employees in the US.
Share plans The charge for share-based payments in respect of share plans is $139m 2011: $153m: 2010: $120m.
The plans are equity settled.
The AstraZeneca Performance Share Plan This plan was approved by shareholders in 2005 for a period of 10 years.
Generally, awards can be granted at any time, but not during a close period of the Company.
The first grant of awards was made in June 2005.
The main grant of awards in 2012 under the plan was in March, with a further smaller grant in August.

For awards to all participants in 2012, except employees of MedImmune, 50% of the award will vest subject to the performance of the Companys total shareholder return TSR compared with that of a selected peer group of other pharmaceutical companies, and 50% will vest subject to the achievement of a net cash flow target.
A separate performance condition applies to employees of MedImmune.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
Further details of this plan can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report from page 122.

At 31 December 2012, the only significant options outstanding were under the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
AstraZeneca Share Option Plan This is a share option plan for employees of participating AstraZeneca Group companies which was approved by shareholders at the Companys AGM in 2000 for a period of 10 years.
The first grant of options occurred in August 2000.
The final grant of options under the plan was in August 2009, since when no further grants have been or will be made.
Options were granted over AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
The price per Ordinary Share payable upon the exercise of an option is not less than an amount equal to the average of the middle-market closing price for an Ordinary Share or ADS of the Company on the London or New York Stock Exchange on the three consecutive dealing days immediately before the date of grant or as otherwise agreed with HM Revenue & Customs.
Where the option is an option to subscribe, the price payable upon exercise cannot be less than the nominal value of an Ordinary Share of the Company.
An option will normally be exercisable between three and 10 years following its grant provided any relevant performance condition has been satisfied.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary Shares or by existing Ordinary Shares purchased in the market.
The Remuneration Committee sets the policy for the Companys operation of the plan including as regards whether any performance target s will apply to the grant and or exercise of each eligible employees option.
Options normally lapse on cessation of employment.
Exercise is, however, permitted for a limited period following cessation of employment either for reasons of injury or disability, redundancy or retirement, or at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, and on an amalgamation, take-over or winding-up of the Company.

The fair value of options was estimated at the date of grant, being prior to 1 January 2010, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on weighted average exercise price, expected volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rates and expected lives.
Expectations of early exercise were incorporated into the model.
The expected volatility was based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones, although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are expensed as the associated sale is recognised.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 75, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Environmental costs and liabilities The Groups expenditure on environmental protection, including AstraZeneca has made provisions for the estimated costs of future both capital and revenue items, relates to costs which are necessary environmental investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance for implementing internal systems and programmes, and meeting activity beyond normal ongoing expenditure for maintaining the legal and regulatory requirements for processes and products.
