22 Financial Instruments As an Investment Trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to achieve its investment objective of maximising total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to various types of risk that are associated with the financial instruments and markets in which it invests.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent loss of capital rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
Risk provides the potential for both loss and gains and in assessing risk, the Board encourages the Managers to exploit the opportunities that risk affords.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value of future cash ows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may uctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Managers both assess the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitor the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on a continuing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9 and on pages 15 to 18.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and report to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Managers assess the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the country in which a company is listed is not necessarily where it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings can limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
SCOTTISH MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 45 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 31 March 2012, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2011.

The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash ows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and xed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, oating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company nances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the market value of the Companys xed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value at fair value.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 March 2012 would have increased the net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 0.43p 2011 decreased by 0.75p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Managers.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objectives and investment policies.
The portfolio does not seek to reproduce the index, investments are selected based upon the merit of individual companies and therefore performance may well diverge from the short term uctuations of the benchmark.
48 ANNUAL REPORT 2012 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued Other Price Risk Sensitivity Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 18.

111.0% 2011 110.0% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
A 3% increase in quoted companies equity valuations at 31 March 2012 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 67,031,000 2011 70,308,000.
A decrease of 3% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is potentially significant but the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are believed to be readily realisable.
The Board provides guidance to the Investment Managers as to the maximum exposure to any one holding and to the maximum aggregate exposure to substantial holdings.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: s 7HERE THE NVESTMENTANAGERS MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN A BOND OR OTHER SECURITY WITH CREDIT RISK THAT CREDIT RISK IS ASSESSED AND THEN compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question.

Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Managers monitor the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board.
s NVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF BROKERS WHOSE CREDITWORTHINESS IS REVIEWED BY THE NVESTMENT Managers.
Transactions are ordinarily undertaken on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations at the same time as any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed.

SCOTTISH MORTGAGE INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 49 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22 Financial Instruments continued Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The Directors are of the opinion that the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are stated at fair value in the balance sheet with the exception of long term borrowing.
Long term borrowings in relation to debentures are included in the accounts at the amortised amount of net proceeds after issue, plus accrued finance costs in accordance with FRS26.
The fair value of bank loans is calculated with reference to government bonds of comparable maturity and yield.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 795.6p to 768.7p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2012 of 708.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 7.9% as against 11.0% on a debt at par basis.
At 31 March 2011 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 833.5p to 816.5p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2011 of 742.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 9.1% as against 11.0% on a debt at par basis.
Capital Management The capital of the Company is its share capital and reserves as set out in notes 13 and 14 together with its borrowings see notes 11 and 12.
The objective of the Company is to maximise total return, whilst also generating real dividend growth, from a focused and actively managed global portfolio.
The Companys investment policy is set out on page 20.
In pursuit of the Companys objective, the Board has a responsibility for ensuring the Companys ability to continue as a going concern and details of the related risks and how they are managed are set out on page 24.
The Company has the authority to issue and buy back its shares see pages 26 and 27 and changes to the share capital during the year are set out in notes 13 and 14.
The Company does not have any externally imposed capital requirements other than the covenants on its loans which are detailed in notes 11 and 12.
