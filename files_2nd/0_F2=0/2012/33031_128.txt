Capital disclosures and analysis of changes in net debt The group defines capital as total equity.
The groups approach to managing capital is set out in its financial framework which BP continues to refine to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders, whilst maintaining a secure financial base.
BP intends to maintain a net debt ratio within the 10-20% gearing range, and continue to hold a significant liquidity buffer while uncertainties remain.
The group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, less the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents.
Net debt and net debt ratio are nonGAAP measures.
BP believes these measures provide useful information to investors.
Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total.
The net debt ratio enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to equity from shareholders.
The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings Derivative financial instruments.
All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.
During 2012 and 2011, the company did not repurchase any of its own shares, other than as needed to satisfy the requirements of certain employee share-based payment plans.
