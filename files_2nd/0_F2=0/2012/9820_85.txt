The Group obtains such valuations from counterparties who use a variety of assumptions based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair values of all financial instruments are equal to their book values, with the exception of borrowings note 17.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables, other receivables and trade loans, and the carrying value of trade payables and other payables, are assumed to approximate their fair values.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires fair value measurements to be recognised using a fair value hierarchy that reects the signicance of the inputs used in the measurements, according to the following levels: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The table below shows the level in the fair value hierarchy into which fair value measurements have been categorised: 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Assets as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative financial instruments 13.7 13.7 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Liabilities as per the balance sheet m m m m m m m m Derivative financial instruments 201.4 201.4 152.8 152.8 There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements during the current or prior period.
