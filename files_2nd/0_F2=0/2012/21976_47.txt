Retirement benefit plans continued Other protection of BTPS member benets In the unlikely event that the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and which applies upon the winding up of BT.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that the Crown Guarantee can cover members who joined before and after privatisation.
The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
In a further High Court decision issued in December 2011, it was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT nor does it cover benefit augmentations granted by BT.
The judgments may still be subject to appeal.
the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
Share-based payments The ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, has savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option plans for selected employees and a stock purchase plan for employees in the US.
It also has several share plans for executives.
All share-based payment plans are equity settled in instruments of BT Group plc and details of these plans and an analysis of the total charge by type of award is set out below.

This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Incentive Share Plan Under the Incentive Share Plan, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
In 2012 the corporate performance measures for the ISP were amended: 40% of each share award is linked to a total shareholder return target TSR for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period: 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure, and 20% to growth in underlying revenue excluding transit.
For ISP awards made in 2011 and 2010, 50% of each share award was linked to a TSR target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period and 50% was linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure.
Deferred Bonus Plan Under the Deferred Bonus Plan, awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP and DBP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
