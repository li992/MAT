Accordingly, the 2011 comparative results and related notes have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the change as if the new accounting policy had always applied, as described in note A5.
Notes i This measure is the formal profi t before tax measure under IFRS but it is not the result attributable to shareholders.
ii Other non-cash items consist of the adjustment of non-cash items to profi t before tax together with other net items, net purchases of treasury shares and other net movements in equity.
iii The acquisition of REALIC in 2012, as explained further in note I1, resulted in a net cash outfl ow of 224 million.
The acquisition of subsidiaries in 2011 related to the PAC with-profi ts funds purchase of Earth & Wind and Alticom venture investments with an outfl ow of 53 million.
iv Structural borrowings of shareholder-fi nanced operations comprise the core debt of the parent company, a PruCap bank loan and Jackson surplus notes.
Core debt excludes borrowings to support short-term fi xed income securities programmes, non-recourse borrowings of investment subsidiaries of shareholder-fi nanced operations and other borrowings of shareholder-fi nanced operations.
Cash fl ows in respect of these borrowings are included within cash fl ows from operating activities.
v Interest paid on structural borrowings of with-profi ts operations relate solely to the 100 million 8.5 per cent undated subordinated guaranteed bonds, which contribute to the solvency base of the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF, a ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC with-profi ts fund.
Cash fl ows in respect of other borrowings of with-profi ts funds, which principally relate to consolidated investment funds, are included within cash fl ows from operating activities.
