Summary The EPRA Best Practice Recommendations identify five key performance measures.

The adjustment in respect of the non-controlling interest recoverable balance not recognised is due to historic accounting practices and is required, in our view, to give a more appropriate value of net assets attributable to equity owners of the Group.
