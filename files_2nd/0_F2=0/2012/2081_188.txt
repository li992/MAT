The recoverable amounts of the Fayetteville CGU and the Onshore US group of CGUs were determined based on fair value less costs to sell FVLCS.
FVLCS was determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expressed in real terms expected to arise from the continued use of the assets life of asset, including any expansion prospects, and its eventual disposal, using assumptions that an independent market participant may take into account.
These cash flows were discounted using a real after-tax discount rate that reflected current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU.
The determination of FVLCS was most sensitive to the following assumptions: Production volumes Crude oil prices Natural gas prices Discount rate Production volumes estimated production volumes were based on detailed data for the fields and took into account development plans for the fields established by management as part of the long-term planning process.
Production volumes are dependent on variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production leases and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of the fields were computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions established by management.
The production profiles used were consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of the Groups process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Crude oil and natural gas prices key assumptions for oil and gas prices were derived from forward price curves and long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
The crude oil prices used in the Onshore US FVLCS were within the range of prices published by market commentators of US$75.82 boe US$101.93 boe.
The natural gas prices used in the Fayetteville Shale FVLCS and the Onshore US FVLCS were within the range of prices published by market commentators of US$2.74 MMBtu US$6.21 MMBtu.
Discount rate in arriving at the FVLCS, a real post-tax discount rate of 5.9 per cent was applied to the post-tax cash flows expressed in real terms.
This discount rate was derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC, with appropriate adjustments made to reflect the risks specific to the CGU.
Fayetteville The goodwill of US$552 million that arose from the acquisition of the Fayetteville gas business in March 2011 has been allocated to the Fayetteville CGU.
The Fayetteville CGU comprises the Fayetteville natural gas reserves and resource: gas production wells and associated facilities: and the gas gathering system located in Arkansas, US.
For the interim period ended 31 December 2011, impairment testing indicated that the Fayetteville CGU was not impaired.
However, since December 2011 there has been a significant fall in US domestic gas prices which prompted the Group to adjust its development plans.
Consequently, a further impairment test was performed as at 30 June 2012 and resulted in a total impairment charge of US$2,835 million being recognised for the year ended 30 June 2012, including impairment of the Fayetteville goodwill of US$552 million and property, plant and equipment of US$2,283 million.
The total impairment charge is included in Expenses excluding net finance costs in the Consolidated Income Statement refer to note 5.
Onshore US The goodwill of US$3,591 million that arose from the acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation has been allocated to the Onshore US group of CGUs which comprises the Fayetteville CGU as well as the Eagleford, Haynesville and Permian Basin CGUs.
The Onshore US group of CGUs comprises the natural gas and liquid reserves and resources, gas production wells and associated facilities, and gas gathering systems in the Eagleford, Haynesville and Permian fields in Texas and Louisiana, US, in addition to the Fayetteville CGU.
The Onshore US group of CGUs is part of the Petroleum reportable segment.
The Onshore US group of CGUs was tested for impairment after testing each of the individual CGUs that it comprises.
The impairment tests for the Eagleford, Haynesville and Permian Basin CGUs indicated that no impairments were required.
As indicated above, an impairment was recognised in relation to the Fayetteville CGU.
The impairment test of the Onshore US group of CGUs was therefore performed after the Fayetteville assets were written down to their recoverable amount.
The result indicated that the recoverable amount of the Onshore US group of CGUs exceeded its carrying amount and no further impairment was required.
With regard to the assessment of FVLCS for the Onshore US group of CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the group of CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.
Other Goodwill held by other CGUs is US$514 million 2011: US$370 million, representing less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2012 2011: less than one per cent.
The goodwill has been allocated across a number of CGUs in different reportable segments, with no CGU accounting for more than US$200 million of total goodwill.
