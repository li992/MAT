112 Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 26.
Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
At 31 December 2012 the groups UK defined benefit pension scheme, which is closed to new members was valued at an accounting surplus of 96.9 million on the groups balance sheet.
The trustees value the scheme on a different basis and a deficit at 31 March 2010 of 80 million was agreed.
Annual contributions of 12.5 million for eight years were agreed to fund the deficit and the group made its first annual contribution of 12.5 million in January 2012 and second contribution in January 2013.
The group has put in place a guarantee in favour of the trustees of the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme which provides that the group willmake payments to the Scheme up to a maximum amount equal to the lowest non-negative amount which, when added to the assets of the Scheme, would result in the Scheme being at least105% funded on the date on which any liability arises, calculated on the basis set out in section 179 of the Pensions Act 2004.
This amount will vary and is in any event capped at 219 million, the amount assessed at 31 March 2009.
The provision of the guarantee is reviewed on an annual basis.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised bi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2012 2011 Weighted average % Discount rate 4.4% 4.8% Expected return on plan assets 5.0% 5.2% Future salary increases 3.9% 4.0% Future pension increases 3.1% 3.2% RPI inflation 3.2% 3.3% CPI inflation 2.5% 2.4% The expected return on plan assets in the above table is a long-term rate of return.
Assets with higher historic volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2012, less an appropriate allowance for the cost of maintaining the swap portfolio.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on 90% of the SAPS Heavy tables for staff members, and 100% of the SAPS Light tables for management members.
In both instances the post-retirement mortality used allows for future mortality improvements in line with CMI 2009 Core Projections with a long-term rate of future improvement of 1.0% per annum.
This equates to an assumption that a man currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 20.8 years if he is a staff member and for a further 23.9 years if he is a management member.
The corresponding figures for a woman are 23.9 and 24.7 years respectively.
The same assumptions were adopted at 31 December 2011.
