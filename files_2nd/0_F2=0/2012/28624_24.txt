Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc the Company is a public company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.
1.1 Developments in reporting standards and interpretations Standards affecting the reported results or the financial position In the current year, there have been no new or revised standards and interpretations that have been adopted and which have had a significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards not affecting the reported results or the financial position The following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted in the current year.
Their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements but may impact the accounting for future transactions and arrangements: amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of items in other comprehensive income this amendment has been adopted earlier than its mandatory date : amendments to IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures.
New standards and interpretations A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2012 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group except for IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, which is not expected to become mandatory for periods commencing before 1 January 2015, and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which is mandatory for periods that commenced on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments could change the classification and measurement of financial assets.
The Group does not plan to adopt this standard early and the extent of the impact has not been determined.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments has not yet been adopted by the EU.
IAS 19 Employee Benefits is mandatory for the Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2013.
The amendments to IAS 19, if applied for the year ended 31 December 2012, would reduce profit after tax by approximately 230,000 and reduce the actuarial gain in other comprehensive income by the same amount.
There would be no effect on total comprehensive income or total equity.
1.2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and special purpose entities, together the Group, made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether an entity is a subsidiary of the Company.
Special purpose entities are consolidated where the substance of the Groups relationship with the entity indicates control by the Group.
Subsidiaries and special purpose entities are fully consolidated from the date on which control is obtained and deconsolidated from the date that control ceases: their results are included in the consolidated financial statements up to the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates are companies over which the Group has significant influence, either by holding 20% or more of the voting rights of the associate and or through other means note 1.4.
For associates with non-coterminous year ends, financial statements are drawn up to 31 December for the purposes of equity accounting.
72 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued 1.3 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they arise within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Later changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are charged to profit or loss or other comprehensive income, except for obligations that are classified as equity, which are not remeasured.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for deferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements which are measured in accordance with applicable accounting policies described in this note.
1.4 Investments in associates Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
1.5 Basis of preparation The consolidated and Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Company financial statements are presented on pages 122 to 141.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments that are measured at fair value notes 1.13 and 1.17.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below and, unless otherwise stated, have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.
1.6 Going concern The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Further detail is contained in the directors report on page 48.
1.7 Foreign currencies The Companys functional and presentational currency is sterling.
The Groups presentational currency is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant Group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in profit or loss for the period.
1.8 Income Net interest income Interest income or expense from interest-bearing financial instruments, except those classified as held for trading, is calculated using the effective interest method and recognised within net interest income.
Dividends received from money market funds are included in net interest income when received.
The effective interest method is the method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or liability or group of assets and liabilities and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument, or when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the instrument.
The application of the method has the effect of recognising income or expense receivable or payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment.
In calculating effective interest, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but excluding future credit losses.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Net fee and commission income Portfolio or asset management fees, trail commissions receivable or payable and fees from advisory services are recognised on a continuous basis over the period that the related service is provided.
Commission charges for executing transactions on behalf of clients are recognised when the transaction is dealt.
Initial charges receivable from the sale of unit holdings in the Groups collective investment schemes and related rebates are recognised at the point of sale.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when received.
1.9 Operating leases Lease agreements which do not transfer substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased assets to the Group are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
The impact of any lease incentives is spread over the term of the lease.
1.10 Share-based payments The Group engages in cash-settled and equity-settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from its employees.
Equity-settled awards For equity-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the award is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the grant date.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the awards or options granted is determined using a binomial pricing model, which takes into account the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option or award, any applicable exercise price and other relevant factors.
Only those vesting conditions that include terms related to market conditions are taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in profit or loss reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market-related vesting condition is met, provided that any non-market vesting conditions are also met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Cash-settled awards For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received to the balance sheet date, measured at the fair value of the liability.
At each subsequent balance sheet date and at the date on which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
1.11 Taxation Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on net taxable income for the year.
Current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.
74 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised, except where the temporary difference arises: from the initial recognition of goodwill: from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit, other than in a business combination: or in relation to investments in subsidiaries and associates, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is the Groups intention not to reverse the temporary difference in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
1.12 Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand.
Cash equivalents comprise money market funds which are realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
1.13 Financial assets Initial recognition Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value.
Classification and subsequent valuation Financial assets are classified in the following categories: At fair value through profit or loss Financial instruments are classified in this category if they are held for trading, or if they are designated in this category by the Group.
Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to profit or loss.
Derivatives are categorised as held for trading.
Fair values of derivatives are determined using valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models and option pricing models as appropriate.
All derivatives are included in assets when their fair value is positive, and liabilities when their fair value is negative, unless the Company has the legal ability and intention to settle net.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan or other debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
If the fair value of the loan on initial recognition is lower than the amount advanced, the shortfall is charged to profit or loss.
Held to maturity Held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss that the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method note 1.8, less any impairment.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Available for sale Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available for sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, and which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available for sale financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the available for sale reserve in equity.
When the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to profit or loss.
Trade date accounting Financial assets, excluding loans and receivables, are recognised on trade date, being the date on which the Group commits to purchase the asset.
Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Fair value measurement The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If an active market for a financial asset does not exist, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that a financial asset carried at amortised cost, or a group of such financial assets, has suffered an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset, or group of assets, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
The Group measures the amount of the impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset, or group of assets, and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset, or group of assets, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset, or group of assets, at initial recognition.
The present value of estimated future cash flows excludes future credit losses that have not been incurred.
Any impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
Financial assets carried at fair value When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised in other comprehensive income and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss.
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value.
Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through profit or loss, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event.
1.14 Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost, which includes directly attributable acquisition costs, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: leasehold property: over the lease term plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to 10 years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount and these are included in profit or loss.
76 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued 1.15 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arises through business combinations and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a business at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is allocated to groups of cash generating units.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2004, being the date of the Groups transition to IFRS, has been retained at the previous UK GAAP carrying amounts and is tested for impairment annually.
Client relationships Individually purchased client relationships are initially recognised at cost.
Client relationships acquired as part of a business combination are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortisation, which is calculated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives normally 10 to 15 years, but not more than 15 years.
When client relationships are lost, the full amount of unamortised cost is recognised immediately in profit or loss and the intangible asset is derecognised.
Computer software and software development costs Costs incurred to acquire and bring to use computer software licences are capitalised and amortised through profit or loss over their expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised as intangible assets when the Group is expected to benefit from future use of the software and the costs are reliably measurable.
Other costs of producing software are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
1.16 Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets At each balance sheet date the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units.
The carrying amount of each cash generating unit is compared to its value-in-use, calculated using a discounted cash flow method.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Client relationship intangibles are tested for impairment on a portfolio basis by comparing the fair value of funds under management for each acquired portfolio of clients with their associated amortised value.
If the recoverable amount of any asset other than client relationships or goodwill is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued 1.17 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and classified as fair value through profit or loss if designated as such or if held for trading or at amortised cost.
The Group has not designated any liabilities as fair value through profit or loss and holds no liabilities as held for trading.
Deposits and borrowings After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method through net interest income note 1.8.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premiums on settlement.
1.18 Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated will occur.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations that depend on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless the likelihood of crystallisation is judged to be remote.
1.19 Retirement benefit obligations The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the associated changes to benefits are already vested.
Where changes to benefits do not vest immediately, past service cost is amortised on a straight line basis over the average vesting period until the amended benefits become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet for death in service benefits represents the present value of the estimated obligation, reduced by the extent to which any future liabilities will be met by insurance policies.
Contributions to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to profit or loss as an expense as they fall due.
1.20 Segmental reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the executive committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients: a description of the services provided by each segment is given in our services on page 9.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the Groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments: intra-segment income and expenditure is eliminated at Group level.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
1.21 Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
Largely as a result of cash and settlement processing, the Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority FSA or the Jersey Financial Services Commission, as applicable.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled to them.
78 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued 1.22 Financial guarantees The Group provides a limited number of financial guarantees, which are backed by assets in clients portfolios.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the guarantee.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
2.1 Loan notes note 15 The Group holds loan notes Notes with a nominal value of 5,000,000 issued by the acquirer of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008.
The Notes are repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the refinancing of the operations disposed of.
The carrying value of the Notes, net of provision for impairment, was 2,821,000 at 31 December 2012.
The impairment has been calculated using a discounted cash flow model based on the estimated repayment date of the Notes, using a discount rate equal to the initial effective interest rate of the loan.
Changing the estimated repayment date of the Notes by one year would result in an increase or decrease in their carrying value, net of provision for impairment, of approximately 230,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the assumed rate at which interest accrues under the loan would increase decrease the net carrying value, net of provision for impairment, by approximately 110,000, with a consequent equal change in profit before tax.
2.2 Client relationship intangibles note 21 The Group makes estimates as to the expected duration of client relationships to determine the period over which related intangible assets are amortised.
The amortisation period is estimated with reference to historical data on account closure rates and expectations for the future.
During the year client relationship intangible assets were amortised over a 10 to 15 year period.
Amortisation of 6,025,000 was charged during the year.
A reduction in the average amortisation period of one year would increase the amortisation charge by approximately 516,000.
At 31 December 2012, the carrying value of client relationship intangibles was 45,548,000.
In determining whether a client relationship is lost, the Group considers factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the existence of other retained family relationships.
2.3 Retirement benefit obligations note 26 The Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
Long term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 2,130,000, the history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 26.
2.4 Financial Services Compensation Scheme levies note 32 The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions has resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years.
The financial impact of unexpected FSCS levies are largely out of the Groups control as they result from other industry failures.
There is significant uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as they depend on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of industry failures.
The Group contributes to the deposit class, investment fund management class and investment intermediation levy classes and accrues levy costs for future levy years when the obligation arises.
The FSCS announced in its November outlook statement that it expected to face a total deficit on the investment fund management and investment intermediation sub-classes of 36,000,000 as a result of tariff data resubmissions.
This amount is in addition to a potential 25,000,000 levy on the investment intermediation sub-classes arising from the failures of Pritchard Stockbrokers, Worldspreads and MF Global.
A final announcement concerning the levy on deposit takers on the unrecoverable cost of five major depositor failures is expected in early 2013.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued Levies of 1,022,000 have been included within administrative expenses in 2012 2011: 425,000.
It is only possible for the Group to estimate its share of these losses until invoices are received.
In July 2012, the FSA issued a consultation paper following its preliminary review of the funding arrangements for the FSCS.
Feedback on the consultation paper was published on 18 January 2013 but a further consultation was launched at that time into the cross-subsidy arrangements between levy paying classes within the scheme.
The result of this review may have a potentially significant impact on the Groups future share of levies raised.
3 Segmental information For management purposes the Group is currently organised into two operating segments: Investment Management and Unit Trusts.
The products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are described in our services on page 9.
Complementary services, as described in our services, are reported within the Investment Management segment.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its performance to the executive committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.
Staff costs for internal reporting purposes include only those staff directly involved in the provision of the services from which each segments revenue is generated.
The cost of staff providing support services is included in indirect expenses.
The presentation of underlying operating income has been amended to show net interest income separately from other income.
Other income is now presented together with fees from advisory services.
This change follows a change in presentation in the information provided to the executive committee and facilitates easier analysis of the Groups revenue margin on funds under management.
Comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.

Intersegment sales are charged at prevailing market prices.
Centrally incurred indirect expenses are allocated to operating segments on the basis of the cost drivers that generate the expenditure: principally the headcount of staff directly involved in providing those services from which the segment earns revenues, the value of funds under management and the segments total revenue.

The Notes are unsecured and have no fixed maturity, being repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the refinancing of the Jersey trust operations by its existing owner.
The Notes are carried at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
In light of the prevailing economic conditions, at 31 December 2012, the Group revised their estimate of the likely timing of repayment of the Notes, which reduced the estimated present value of future cash flows from the Notes due to the impact of discounting.
In accordance with IAS 36, the carrying value of the Notes was written down to 2,821,000 being the estimated present value of future cash flows, resulting in an impairment loss of 760,000 in the year.
At 31 December 2011, loans and advances to customers repayable within three months included a Swiss franc denominated loan to the acquirer of the Groups former Switzerland-based trust operations with a nominal value equivalent to 406,000.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 19 Net deferred tax asset Deferred income taxes are calculated on all temporary differences under the liability method using an effective tax rate of 23.0% 2011: 25.0%.
The UK Government has proposed that the UK corporation tax rate be reduced to 21.0% over the next two years.
At 31 December 2012 only an element of this reduction, taking the UK tax rate to 23.0% in 2013, had been substantively enacted.
Consequently deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at 23.0%.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 20 Investment in associates and related derivatives On 5 October 2012, the Group purchased 19.9% of the ordinary share capital of Vision Independent Financial Planning Limited and Castle Investment Solutions Limited, as well as certain options over the equity instruments of those companies, for a total consideration of 2,000,000.
The total consideration was constituted as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Investment in associates 1,216 Fair value of associated derivative contracts note 17 784 2,000 Investment in associates Although the Group holds less than 20% of the equity shares of both companies, it exercises significant influence by virtue of its contractual right to appoint one director to the board of directors of both companies.
The movements in the Groups investment in associates are as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 At 1 January Additions 1,216 Share of profit 21 At 31 December 1,237 The results of the associates, and their aggregated assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2012, are as follows: Assets Liabilities Revenues Profit % interest Name Country of incorporation 000 000 000 000 held Vision Independent Financial Planning Limited England and Wales 227 69 167 51 19.9 Castle Investment Solutions Limited England and Wales 175 7 55 52 19.9 402 76 222 103 Groups share of profit 21 Derivative financial instruments As part of the transaction to acquire these holdings, the Group has also entered into certain option contracts over the equity instruments of these companies.
Under these contracts the Group has the right to acquire the remaining 80.1% of the share capital of both associates for a variable exercise price in the third quarter of 2015.
If the Group does not exercise its right to acquire the associates remaining share capital, the founders of the associates have the right to re-purchase the Groups stakes in the associates for 2,000,000 in the fourth quarter of 2015.
The Group also has the right to sell its entire holdings in the associates to the founders for consideration of 1 at any time until 29 February 2016.
The option contracts were initially recognised at their fair value of 784,000.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of the option contracts remained at 784,000.
The fair value of the option contracts is calculated using a probability weighted expected return model note 30.

No impairment was recognised during the year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Investment management 45,287 45,287 Trust and tax 1,954 1,954 47,241 47,241 The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board, covering the forthcoming year.
The key assumptions underlying the budgets are that organic growth rates, revenue margins and profit margins will be in line with recent historical rates and equity markets will be flat for the forthcoming year.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to 10 years based on a medium to long term growth rate of 3% for the investment management CGU and 2% for the trust and tax CGU based on the Groups expectation of future industry growth rates.
A 10 year extrapolation period is chosen based on a prudent assessment by the Group of the likely duration of client relationships.
The Group estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10% for investment management and 12% for trust and tax 2011: 10% and 12% respectively, based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
The Group judges that these discount rates appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.
Sensitivity analysis of the key assumptions did not result in any scenarios which would have resulted in an impairment loss.

During the ordinary course of business the Group may be subject to complaints as well as threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisers where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to the Groups best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property-related and other provisions include 797,000 in relation to dilapidation provisions expected to arise on leasehold premises held by the Group 2011: 950,000.
Dilapidation provisions are calculated using a discounted cash flow model: during the year, the impact of discounting has increased the provisions by 51,000.
Provisions payable after one year are expected to be settled within two years of the balance sheet date, except for propertyrelated provisions of 786,000, which are expected to be settled within 24 years of the balance sheet date, which corresponds to the longest lease for which a dilapidations provision is being held.
26 Long term employee benefits The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 2,223,000 2011: 1,750,000.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 22,000 2011: 21,000.
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
The Group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 614,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2011: 539,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date, based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2010 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2010 96 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 26 Long term employee benefits continued The assumptions used by the actuaries, to estimate the schemes liabilities, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.
Due to the timescale covered by the liability, these assumptions may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2012 2011 2012 2011 Laurence Keen Laurence Keen Rathbone 1987 Rathbone 1987 Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Scheme % Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 4.10 4.00 4.10 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.40 3.40 3.00 3.10 Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.00 3.10 3.00 3.10 Discount rate 4.50 4.70 4.50 4.70 Expected return on scheme assets 4.50 4.60 4.80 5.00 3.10 Inflation 3.00 3.10 3.00 Inflation assumptions are based on the Retail Prices Index The assumed duration of the liabilities for the Laurence Keen Scheme is 18 years 2011: 18 years and the assumed duration for the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 24 years 2011: 24 years.
The overall expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the returns expected on each class of asset held by the scheme, as disclosed below.
The normal retirement age for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme is 65 60 for certain former directors.
The normal retirement age for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme is 60 for service prior to 1 July 2009 and 65 thereafter, following the introduction of pension benefits based on Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE from that date.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the S1NA actuarial tables.

During the year, the trustees switched the funds holdings into inflation-linked interest rate swaps.
The swaps are long-dated and their duration is intended to broadly align with the duration of the schemes liabilities.
The expected return on equities is assumed to be 3.25% above the return on long-dated gilts 2011: 3.25% above.
The expected rate of return on debt instruments is based on long term yields at the start of the year.
Cash has been assumed to generate a similar return to the Bank of England base rate.
The statements of investment principles set by the trustees require that the assets of the schemes are invested in a balanced portfolio in the following asset classes and proportions: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme UK equities 35% 55% 43% 57% Overseas equities 0% 20% 21% 35% Fixed interest stocks 45% 65% 14% 28% Cash deposits 45% 65% 0% 8% The total allocation of assets in the Laurence Keen Scheme to fixed interest stocks and cash deposits is expressed as a combined percentage of the two asset classes in the statement of investment principles In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, not more than 80% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 5% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 5% of the total portfolio can be invested in hedge funds.
The trustees have initiated a programme of reducing the equity exposure of the portfolio over the next 10 years as the scheme matures by switching a proportion of the schemes assets into fixed income and index-linked securities on the occurrence of a series of time-based and or market-based trigger events.
At 31 December 2012, 19,657,000 2011: 17,277,000 of the schemes assets had been switched under the programme.
In the Laurence Keen Scheme, not more than 55% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 15% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 15% of the assets may be held in alternative assets.

Additional lump sum contributions of 2,874,000 were paid in 2012 2011: 2,750,000.
From 2013, the Groups regular contributions will fall to 14.8% of pensionable salaries and the Group has committed to make additional annual contributions to the scheme of 1,750,000 in 2013 and 2,750,000 per annum thereafter until 30 June 2017.
With effect from 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the Group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 756,000 2011: 756,000.
Additional lump sum contributions of 17,000 were paid in 2012 2011: nil.
Annual contributions of 756,000 will continue to be made to the Laurence Keen Scheme until April 2013.
Thereafter, annual contributions of 336,000 will be made until December 2017.
As the scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 October 1999, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time, and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.

29 Share-based payments Share Incentive Plan The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP, which is available to all employees.
Employees can contribute up to 125 per month to acquire partnership shares which are purchased or allotted twice a year at the end of six-month accumulation periods.
The Group currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares.
The Group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of 100 per 1% real increase in EPS up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum.
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase dividend shares up to 1,500 in any tax year, whilst for Jersey employees dividends are paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2012, the trustees of the SIP held 1,428,214 2011: 1,394,076 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 18,553,000 2011: 14,777,000.

Long Term Incentive Plan Details of the general terms of this plan are set out in the remuneration report on page 56.
The total shareholder return-based performance criteria have been treated as market-based vesting conditions.
Historically, the Group has settled substantially all of the LTIP awards in cash as an alternative to shares.
As a consequence of this, the Group treats awards under the LTIP as cash-settled rather than equity-settled.
At the year end, a liability of 2,278,000 2011: 1,175,000 has been recognised for the estimated fair value of future awards.
At 31 December 2012, the trustees held 106,604 2011: 106,604 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 1,385,000 2011: 1,130,000.
Dividends on these shares have been waived by the trustees.
Executive profit share Details of the terms of the executive profit share scheme are set out in the remuneration report on page 55.

The Group recognised total expenses of 3,232,000 in relation to share-based payment transactions in 2012 2011: 2,604,000.
30 Financial risk management The Group has identified the financial, business and operational risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the group risk committee report on pages 27 to 31.
The Group categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The Groups exposures to pension risk are set out in note 26.
The Groups financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the Group faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The Group regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group treasury manual and policy documents prescribe the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued Eurozone credit crisis Following the escalation of the eurozone credit crisis in 2011, the second half of 2012 saw concerted action within Europe to address the crisis.
This reduced volatility in the credit markets towards the end of the year.
The banking committee has continued to be vigilant during the year in assessing the risks of exposure to the eurozone and the exposures that had been placed with Spanish and Italian counterparties was reduced to zero in the first half of 2012.
In response to the ongoing issues within the eurozone, the analysis of geographical concentration of credit exposures has been amended to show separately the total exposure to counterparties based in the UK, the eurozone and the rest of the world.
The Groups treasury portfolio remains well diversified and includes 276,500,000 of certificates of deposit and holdings in money market funds issued or managed by a number of banks based in the eurozone 2011: 444,500,000.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had no direct exposure to eurozone sovereign entities 2011: none.
The controls around the treasury portfolio are set out below.
i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds in the money market and holding interest-bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan book, guarantees given on clients behalf and loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey operations in 2008 note 15.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions, including the Bank of England.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd. Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
The Groups financial assets are categorised as follows: Cash and balances with central banks The Group has exposure to central banks through its deposits held with the Bank of England.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-settlement is borne by clients.
104 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued Loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit and money market funds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of clients cash, where it is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations the investment management loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and pensions advisory businesses trust and pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans are provided as a service to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
The banking committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where possible, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December 2012, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 85,000,000 2011: 60,000,000, of which 65,067,000 had been advanced 2011: 36,434,000 and a further 3,002,000 had been committed 2011: 6,925,000. c Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the Groups trust and pension advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers are principally constituted by loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008 note 15.
Such debts do not usually arise within the course of the Groups day to day operations and therefore they are not subject to formalised standard lending criteria.
Derivative financial instruments At 31 December 2012, the only derivative financial instruments held by the Group were the option contracts over shares in the Groups associates note 20.
These options expose the Group to credit risk from the potential for non-delivery by the associate companies founders, who are private individuals.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually, or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors and other debtors, are set out in note 15.

All loans initially made subject to standard lending criteria remained within those criteria at 31 December 2012 2011: all loans.
An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and pension debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 days is expected.

The banking committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements.
In addition to setting the treasury policy, Rathbone Investment Management the Bank performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the regulatory requirements of the FSA our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are monitored by daily cash mismatch analyses and Basel Committee ratios using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments that are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the Board at least annually in addition to an amount being prescribed by the FSA.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is expected to rise and shortens it when the yield curve is expected to fall.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest-bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2012, the Bank had 792.2 million 2011: 876.2 million of sterling interest-bearing liabilities averaging two days 2011: two days to repricing, which were matched by sterling assets averaging 51 days 2011: 65 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 49 days 2011: 63 days.
The total potential impact on profit after tax and equity was 2,126,000 2011: 2,211,000 at the balance sheet date for a 2% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The Group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2012 2011: none.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time to time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Group has no structural foreign currency exposure.
114 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translational risk at 31 December 2012.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
A 10% weakening of the euro against sterling, occurring on 31 December 2012, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 55,000 2011: reduced by 50,000.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar or euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 115 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 16.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 4,198,000 2011: 2,953,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 420,000 2011: 295,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 16.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 3,584 614 4,198 money market funds 51,551 51,551 Derivative financial instruments 784 784 Total financial assets 3,584 51,551 1,398 56,533 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2011 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 2,384 569 2,953 money market funds 65,610 65,610 Total financial assets 2,384 65,610 569 68,563 There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
The fair value of listed equity securities is their quoted price.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
Level 3 financial instruments Available for sale equity securities The fair value of unlisted equity securities is calculated by reference to net asset values with a liquidity discount applied.
A 5 percentage point increase in the liquidity discount applied to the calculation of the fair value of the unlisted equity securities would, in isolation, result in a decrease in fair value of 41,000 2011: 38,000.
A 5 percentage point decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
Derivative financial instruments The fair value of the option contracts is calculated using a probability weighted expected return model, based on potential valuation outcomes under a range of business growth forecast scenarios.
The key assumptions underlying the forecast growth in profitability of the associates in the model are the growth of funds under management, revenue margins and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the cash flows.
The key assumptions are flexed in each scenario to generate a potential valuation for the options.
The probability of each scenario occurring is estimated, based on the Groups judgement in light of the economic conditions prevailing at the time.
The fair value of the options is calculated as the weighted average of the valuations derived under each scenario, taking account of the associated probabilities of occurrence.

From time to time, the Group runs small overnight overdraft balances as part of working capital.
The Group has no other external borrowings at 31 December 2012 2011: nil.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain a strong capital base to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across Group companies reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the Group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified under the Capital Requirements Directive CRD as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the FSA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with CRD rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the CRDs Pillar I and Pillar II methodology.
The Group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar I credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both Group and entity level.
At 31 December 2012 the Groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2012, were 118,378,000 2011: 89,770,000.
Resources increased during 2012 following the share placing on 6 November 2012 note 27.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecasted on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
Regulatory capital requirements have been met throughout the financial years ended 31 December 2011 and 2012.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 117 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees directors of client companies and providing other services.
A claim relating to the management of a Jersey trust has been filed against a former employee and director of Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited.
Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited was a subsidiary of the Company from March 2000 until October 2008.
Although the Board believe this claim will be unsuccessful, a possible obligation may exist which is contingent on whether the claim or any parts of it is upheld.
The Group has sought to confirm the position of the Companys civil liability professional indemnity insurers in relation to the claim.
Based on information currently available, the Companys primary layer insurer has confirmed cover including its share of the excess layer subject to policy terms and conditions and unless the proceedings referred to below rule there is no liability.
The remaining excess insurers have to date refused to confirm cover.
On 25 July 2012, the Company issued proceedings to confirm insurance cover against the excess insurers.
Due to the complexity of the claim, the number of parties involved and the impact of insurance cover available to the trustees, it is not practicable to estimate reliably the value of any possible obligation for the Company.
The Board considers that it is unlikely that a material liability to the Group will arise from this claim, and accordingly no provision has been made.
b Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2012 but not provided in the financial statements amounted to 470,000 2011: 2,223,000. c The contractual amounts of the Groups commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Guarantees 578 578 Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 3,002 6,925 3,580 7,503 The fair value of the guarantees is nil 2011: nil.
d The Group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
The Companys agreement to lease space at 1 Curzon Street, London, under which total payments over the lease term at 31 December 2012 were 34,616,000, provides for an upward only reset to market rents in 2018.
