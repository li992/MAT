Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies General Imagination Technologies Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 81 to 84.
Basis of preparation The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The following new standards and amendments to standards as adopted by the European Union at 30 April 2012 are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2011: Revised IAS 24 Related party disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayment of a minimum funding requirement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendments to disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Presentation of statement of changes in equity effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 IFRS 3 now requires that acquisition expenses are charged to the Group income statement note 24 and that adjustments to contingent consideration are recognized in the Group income statement.
With this exception, these accounting standards, amendments and interpretations have had no material effect on the results or financial position of the Group disclosed within these financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below under Significant accounting judgements and estimates.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the investments have been stated at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The Group has adequate financial resources together with long term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across a range of consumer market segments and geographic areas.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executives Review on pages 3 to 9.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in notes 12 and 14.
In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes: the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
55 Business Combinations The Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control passes.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration paid or payable less the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities acquired, all measured as of the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognized in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
See note 24 for the application of the policy to the business combinations that occurred during the period.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement.
When share-based payment awards replacement awards are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquirees employees acquirees awards and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
The determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and or future services.
Revenue Revenue comprises of: the value of consideration received for sales of licenses to the Groups technology, royalties arising from the resulting sale of licensees products embedded with the Groups technology, development income, support, maintenance, training, and the sale of goods.
The Group follows the principles of IAS 18 Revenue recognition.
Revenue associated with the sales of goods is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: The Group has transferred the significant risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer The Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold: The amount of revenue can be measured reliably: It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group: and The costs incurred and or to be incurred can be measured reliably.
Revenue associated with the provision of services is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: The amount of revenue can be measured reliably It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group: The stage of completion of the transaction as at the end of the reporting period can be measured reliably: and The costs incurred, or to be incurred for the transaction can be measured reliably.
Therefore, revenue from standard licenses is recognized on delivery to the customer, which is when it is considered the above conditions are met.
Revenue on licence agreements for products which are either not finished or which need to be modified to meet specific customer requirements is recognized on a  basis over the period from starting development of the product to delivery.
The  is measured by monitoring progress compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Progress is measured by an assessment of performance against key development milestones.
Revenue associated with rights in license agreements to unspecified current and future products as opposed to unspecified upgrades and enhancements is recognized under a subscription accounting basis, on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
Revenue on development work is recognized on a  basis over the period from the start of the development to delivery.
Development work is normally invoiced as milestones are achieved.
Where invoicing milestones on licence or development arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance to date, the right to the un-invoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognized.
In particular it considers whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice milestones will be achieved in the expected timeframe, that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled and that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will be incurred.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not recognized until there is sufficient 56 evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Where an agreement involves several components, the total fee is allocated to individual components based on the fair value of the components.
The fair value is assessed by reference to prices regularly charged for the components when sold separately, or if this cannot be used, then other factors may be considered, such as the excess of similar agreements over the charges of separately identifiable components.
If the fair value of a component is not determinable, then the total fee is deferred until the fair value is determinable, or the component has been delivered to the customer.
Where, in effect, two or more components of an agreement are linked and fair values cannot be allocated to the individual components, the revenue recognition criteria are applied to the components as if they were a single component.
Revenue for maintenance is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which maintenance is contractually agreed with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees, development income and maintenance invoiced over revenue recognized is recorded as deferred income.
Royalty revenues are earned on the sale by licensees of products containing the Groups technology.
Revenues are recognized as they are earned to the extent that the Group has sufficient evidence of sales of products containing the Groups technology by licensees.
Notification is generally received in the quarter following the shipment of the customers products.
Revenues from the sale of goods are recognized upon delivery.
Revenue is accounted for net of VAT, discounts and returns.
Returns are recognized at the point at which the Group has adequate knowledge that products are likely to be returned by a customer.
As disclosed above, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors, the Group makes significant estimates in applying its revenue recognition policies.
Estimates are made in particular, in regards to the  accounting method, which requires that the extent of progress towards completion of contracts may be anticipated with reasonable certainty.
The use of this method is based on the assumption that, at the outset of licence agreements, there is an insignificant risk that customer acceptance will not be obtained.
The Group also makes assessments, based on prior experience, of the extent to which future milestone receipts represent a probable future economic benefit to the Group.
The complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the revenue recognition policies affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.
If different assumptions were used, it is possible that different amounts would be reported in the financial statements.
Research and development costs Costs of basic and applied research are written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalized where it relates to a specific project where technical and commercial feasibility has been established, adequate technical, financial and other resources exist to complete the project, the expenditure attributable to the project can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are probable.
In this case, it is recognized as an intangible asset and amortized over its useful economic life.
All other development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred after the establishment of technical feasibility and overall project and commercial profitability have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalized to date.
Operating leases Rental charges in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension plan.
Payments are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Share-based payment transactions The share option programmes and the Share Incentive arrangements allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of Share Incentives is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the Share Incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives granted is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of Share Incentives that vest except where forfeiture is due only to market-based performance conditions not meeting the threshold for vesting.
For the Share Appreciation Rights, cash bonuses are calculated by reference to the value of shares.
The fair value of these bonuses is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as personnel expense in the income statement.
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company is debited directly in equity to retained earnings.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.
57 Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Temporary differences on goodwill are not provided for as are not deductible for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer possible that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are taken to the income statement.
On consolidation, results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.
The assets and liabilities are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation have been recognized directly in the translation reserve within equity.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the board of directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Intangible assets Software, trademarks and patents are capitalized as intangible assets at cost of acquisition and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, between 3 and 5 years.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
Useful economic lives are reviewed on an annual basis.
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill.
Fair value of the intangible assets is assessed assuming a hypothetical market.
The Group utilizes the income based approach when reliable future cash flows are available.
Alternatively, the cost approach or market approach are utilized.
Trade investments Trade investments are classed as available for sale and are stated on the balance sheet at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognized directly in equity in the revaluation reserve, except for impairment losses.
When these investments are derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized directly in equity is recognized in profit or loss.
The fair value of unquoted investments is made by reference to recent funding rounds or, in the absence of the former, to a discounted cash-flow forecast.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid or payable over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions is capitalized.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition and is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognized immediately in the income statement and may not be subsequently reversed.
Impairment testing is based on assets grouped at the lowest possible level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
On disposal of a subsidiary or business, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is stated on the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations that took place prior to 1 April 2004 have not been re-stated and goodwill represents the amount recognized under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to write down their cost using the straight line method to their estimated residual values over the period of their estimated useful economic lives.
Periodic reviews are made of estimated remaining useful economic lives and residual values, and the depreciation rates applied are: Freehold land No depreciation Freehold buildings 2 per cent on cost Leasehold improvements Equally over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10 per cent to 33 per cent on cost Motor vehicles 25 per cent on cost 58 Impairment Non-financial assets Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such condition exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, estimates are made of the cashflows of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate appropriate to the specific asset or cash generating unit.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying value of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Financial assets A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its current fair value.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
Any cumulative gain or loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognized previously in equity is transferred to the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized directly in equity.
Derivative financial instruments Currency exchange contracts are utilised to manage the exchange risk on actual transactions related to accounts receivable, denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business.
These currency exchange contracts do not subject the Group to risk from exchange rate movements because the gains and losses on such contracts offset losses and gains, respectively, on the transactions being hedged.
The currency exchange contracts and related accounts receivable are recorded at fair value at each period end.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of foreign currency options is based upon valuations performed by management and the respective banks holding the currency instruments.
All recognised gains and losses resulting from the settlement of the contracts are recorded within general and administrative expenses in the income statement.
The Group does not enter into currency exchange contracts for the purpose of hedging anticipated transactions.
Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventory is calculated using the FIFO method.
Finished goods include direct costs and attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Cash and equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of less than or equal to three months.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Long Term Borrowing Long term borrowings are recognized initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, long term borrowings are stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
59 Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In applying the Groups accounting policies described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the financial statements: Revenue Recognition The Group has made estimates on the  for licensing and development work which affect the amount of revenue recognized in the period.
These estimates involve the Group assessing the estimated resource and time required to complete development projects.
Share based payments The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models which take into account the terms and conditions upon which the award was made.
In determining the appropriate expense, the Group has made estimates on the likelihood that internal performance targets will be achieved and on the number of employees that will be employed on vesting.
Details of share-based payments and the assumptions applied are disclosed in note 23.
Taxation A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilize the temporary difference.
The Group has made estimates on the likelihood that future taxable profit will utilize these tax losses.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a minimum on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill at a determined discount rate and an appropriate growth rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Details of assumptions used are set out in note 9. Business Combinations The Group measures contingent consideration at fair value at the acquisition date and assesses any changes in fair value on an annual basis.
This requires the Group to make an estimate of the future payables in respect of the contingent consideration.
Details of the assessment performed in the current year are set out in note 24.
Valuation of acquired Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill.
If such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over the estimated life of the asset, or where future cashflows are less certain, by discounting the cost of replicating such intangible asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Investments The Group has stated trade investments at fair value.
Further details of these investments and the valuation basis are detailed in note 9 and note 19.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations had been issued but they are not yet effective for the Group and have not been early adopted.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS 1 effective for annual periods being on or after 1 July 2012 2 Segment Reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Board of Directors, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The Group is organized into two operating divisions which offer different services to different industries and are managed separately: the Technology business and the Pure business.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions.
These divisions are the operating segments that are reported to the chief operating decision maker and are the Groups reportable segments.
There is no inter-segment trading and no significant seasonality in the Groups operations although there is an increase in trading in the period leading up to Christmas.
60 Principal activities are as follows: Technology business the development of embedded graphics, video, display and multi-threaded processor and multi-standard broadcast receiver and connectivity technologies for licensing to semiconductor companies for incorporation into silicon devices.
Pure business the development and marketing of consumer products to showcase the technologies of the Technology business and to develop new and emerging markets for such technologies.
Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on operating profit.
Costs within the technology business do not relate to one or other of the income streams and have not been allocated to either the licensing or royalty streams.

Management consider the utilisation of the 18,829,000 2011: 24,868,000 cumulative tax losses to be probable based on assessment of forecasts of future taxable profits.
The element of the deferred tax charge recorded against equity relates to the reversal of previously recognised deferred tax assets which were credited to equity.
The reversal of the asset occurs upon the exercise of share based incentives.
In 2011 a deferred tax liability of 4,651,000 arose on intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of Caustic Graphics, Inc. and HelloSoft Inc.

During the period the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets.
The test was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Technology business.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the Directors have projected cashflows a four year forecast period is used which is based on management forecasts of future profits, with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2016 of 2.5% per annum 2011: 2.5%.
The terminal growth rate is assessed taking into account general economic conditions.
Forecast revenue growth the revenue projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Forecast operating margins the operating margin projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Discount rate future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 15% which represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the Technology business 2011: 15%.
The Directors do not believe that any reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.
The 820,000 adjustment made to Goodwill in the current year represents a correction of the Goodwill balance recorded in the previous year in relation to the HelloSoft acquisition.
Goodwill was increased in the current year to reflect HelloSofts pre-acquisition deferred income balance which was inadvertently excluded from the fair value of net assets at acquisition date and hence from the calculation of Goodwill.
The Directors do not consider this to be a material adjustment and therefore have not restated comparative balances.
Toumaz Holdings Toumaz During the year the Group increased its holding in Toumaz, a company listed on AIM.
The fair value of the shares acquired on the date of acquisition was 6,069,000, which generated a gain on investment of 822,000 due to the difference in the fair value of the shares received and the consideration given.
This gain on investment was recognised in the income statement during the year.
At the balance sheet date, the Groups investment in Toumaz was valued at 9,338,000 2011: 2,459,000 by reference to the quoted share price of Toumaz Holdings at the reporting date.

19 Financial Instruments Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Categories of financial instruments Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the Financial Statements.
2012 2011 Notes 000 000 Financial assets Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables 11 27,430 13,287 Cash and cash equivalents 12 66,262 49,374 Available for sale investments 9 12,985 5,717 Total financial assets 106,677 68,378 71 2012 2011 Notes 000 000 Financial liabilities Bank loan 14 5,527 5,587 Trade and other payables 13 8,626 5,239 Total financial liabilities 14,153 10,826 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimizing the return on risk.
a Foreign currency risk The Group transacts licence and development agreements with customers and purchases of products for Pure primarily in US dollars and, therefore, the Groups earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis and, if there is a material exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and the Board considers it appropriate, the Group will reduce the risk by currency hedging on net receivable payable balances.
Forward contracts will be entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with currency receipt.
During the period currency contracts amounted to 6,182,000 2011:0.
As at 30 April 2012 the outstanding currency contract amounted to 7,993,000 2011: nil.
The most important foreign currency to the Group is the US Dollar.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group transacts a large proportion of its revenues and costs in US Dollars.
Taking all income and expenditure in US Dollars into account, management have appraised that for the financial year to 30 April 2011, each additional one cent increase or decrease in the US Dollar exchange rate against Sterling would have decreased or increased revenues by circa 615,000 2011: 446,000 and profit by circa 395,000 2011: 262,000. b Interest rate risk The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
The Group aims to maximize returns from funds held on deposit and uses market deposits with major clearing banks accordingly.
With the current level of bank deposits, the impact of a change in interest rates is not considered material.
72 In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their average effective interest rate at the reporting date and the periods in which they mature or, if earlier, reprice.
The fixed rate cash deposits were placed with banks throughout the year and earned interest of between 0.06% and 1.08%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on LIBID equivalents.
Short term receivables and payables are not interest bearing with the exception of the short term element of the long term loan.
The Group has two long term loans.
The loan with a balance of 313,000 is repayable over 8 years and incurs interest at a rate of 2.0% over base rate.
A loan for 5,215,000 was taken out during the prior year.
The loan floats at 1.6% above LIBOR and the unexpired term is 5 years.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis In the financial year to 30 April 2012, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been increased by circa 466,000 2011: 364,000.
Similarly, if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been decreased by circa 247,000 2011: 126,000. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment of liquid funds.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counter parties that have a high credit rating.
Capital Risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issued new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial year.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 14, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 16.
The CFO regularly monitors the capital risk on behalf of the board.
73 Trade Receivables The exposure to credit risk is mitigated by selling to a diverse range of customers.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers prior to sales taking place.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk either by customer or by geography.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2012 2012 2011 2011 Ageing of trade receivables: 000 000 000 000 Not past due 19,565 10,072 Past due 0-90 days 3,939 2,216 Past due greater than 90 days 1,578 125 902 125 25,082 125 13,190 125 Trade receivables that are less than three months overdue are generally not considered impaired.
Receivables more than three months overdue are considered on a line by line basis and a provision is made where recovery is considered doubtful.
No other financial assets are past due.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
To minimize this risk the Group only invests funds in liquid securities.
As a contingency, the Group maintains a 3 million overdraft facility.
The following table is drawn up based on undiscounted contractual maturities including both interest and principal cashflows.

2012 2011 Carrying amount Carrying amount and fair value and fair value Notes 000 000 Financial assets: Trade and other receivables 11 27,430 13,287 Cash and cash equivalents 12 66,262 49,374 Available for sale investments 9 12,985 5,717 Financial liabilities: Long term borrowings 14 5,527 5,587 Trade and other payables 13 8,626 5,239 Assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above: 74 Cash and cash equivalents The fair value approximates to book value due to the short term maturity of these instruments.
Available for sale investments Fair Value Hierarchy The Group measures the fair value of available for sale investments using the following hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical financial instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, such as market prices for similar financial instruments.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using unobservable inputs which can have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
The Group has applied the above hierarchy to its investments as follows: Toumaz the valuation is based on the quoted share price for Toumaz Holdings on AIM.
This investment is categorised as Level 1.
Frontier the valuation of the equity holding in Frontier is based on a discounted cashflow with assumptions made on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
The fair value of the loan note in Frontier is assessed to approximate to book value.
This investment is categorised as Level 3.
GreenPlug the valuation of the equity holding in GreenPlug is based on a discounted cashflow with assumptions made on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
Audioboo the valuation of the equity holding in Audioboo is based on the most recent funding round which is estimated to approximate to the fair value as at the reporting date.
The fair value of the convertible loan note in Audioboo is assessed to approximate to book value This investment is categorised as Level 3.
Orca the valuation is based on the purchase price of the investment which was acquired during the year.
The following table analyses investments, measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised: 2012 2011 000 000 Level 1 9,338 2,459 Level 2 Level 3 3,647 3,258 12,985 5,717 The following table shows a reconciliation from opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: 000 At 30 April 2011 3,258 Investment in the year 477 Total gains and losses: In income statement 145 In other comprehensive income 57 At 30 April 2012 3,647 Although the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
With respect to fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of Frontier and GreenPlug would not be impacted by making reasonable changes to the assumptions on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
The valuation of the Audioboo is based on a funding round carried out in December 2011 and in the short intervening period the value is not viewed to be materially different.
Any change in the valuation of Audioboo would have a commensurate change in the value of the Groups holding.
The valuation of Orca is based on the purchase price of the investment which was acquired during the year and in the short intervening period the value is not viewed to be materially different.
75 Loan Note The Loan Note in Frontier is non-interest bearing.
The time period for redemption of the Loan Note is subject to the discretion of Frontier, Loan Note holders or a sale or listing and therefore is undetermined.
Fair value is therefore assessed to approximate to book value.
The Convertible Loan Note in Audioboo is non-interest bearing.
The time period for conversion of the Convertible Loan Note is subject to the discretion of the Group.
Fair value is assessed to approximate to book value.
Long term borrowings The fair value approximates to book value as this instrument is at a variable interest rate.
20 Contingent Liabilities The Group had no contingent liabilities at 30 April 2012 or 30 April 2011.
21 Employee Benefits Pension The Group participates in a number of defined contribution pension plans in the UK.
The assets of the schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
There were no outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options are as follows: Weighted average Number Weighted average Number exercise price of options exercise price of options 2012 2012 2011 2011 Outstanding at the beginning of the period 82p 4,991,729 65p 7,100,745 Exercised during the period 53p 2,411,932 60p 1,673,440 Granted during the period 355p 413,982 305p 358,381 Lapsed during the period 191p 76,804 79p 793,957 Outstanding at the end of the period 143p 2,916,975 82p 4,991,729 Exercisable at the end of the period 53p 1,591,793 46p 2,473,230 The weighted average share price during the period was 488.94p 2011: 364.8p.
The options outstanding at the year end have an exercise price in the range of 0p to 366.2p and a weighted average contractual life of 2.0 years.
The Company has share option schemes and an employee share plan scheme, details of which are contained in the Remuneration Report.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the fair value of services received in return for share options and employee share plan awards granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of share options and employee share plan awards granted.

The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
There are no new accounting policies which would have a significant impact in the current year.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK Accounting Standards and under the historical accounting rules.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the period and preceding year in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated accounts which it has prepared.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with its subsidiaries.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the contracted rate or rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Details of the Companys subsidiary undertakings are included in note 23 of the Group financial statements.
Share based payment The fair value of options granted is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the fair value of the amount payable to the employee is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The fair value is measured based on an option pricing model taking in to account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is revalued at each balance sheet date and settlement date with any changes to fair value being recognized in the profit and loss account.
As the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries, in accordance with UITF 44, it recognizes an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment charge recognized in its subsidiarys financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognized directly in equity.
Transactions of the Companys Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Companys financial statements.
In particular, the Trusts purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited directly to equity.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
