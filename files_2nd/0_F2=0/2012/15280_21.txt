Foreign operations are included categories: those measured as at fair value and those measured in accordance with the policies set out in note 2. at amortised cost.
The determination is made at initial recognition.
The classication depends on the entitys business New and amended standards adopted by the group model for managing its financial liabilities, the standard retains There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective most of the IAS39 requirements.

The amendments do not address which items are presented in OCI.

IFRSs and US GAAP, do not extend the use of fair value accounting but provide guidance on how it should be applied There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not where its use is already required or permitted by other yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact standards within IFRSs or US GAAP.
IAS19, Employee benets, was amended in June 2011.
The most significant impact on the Group in its 2013 financial statements will be to replace interest cost and expected return on plan assets with a net interest amount that is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net dened benefit liability asset.
This change is expected to reduce the Groups reported profit by 3.2 million.
This net interest charge will be reported as part of finance costs rather than as a charge to operating profit.
The additional amount to be reclassied is estimated to be 1.9 million to yield a total net interest charge of 5.1 million.

The key assumptions for those discounted cash ow calculations are the discount rate, profitability and growth rate.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted, where appropriate, for the risk premium attributable to the particular CGUs activities and geography of operation.
profitability and growth rates are based on past experience combined with managements expectations for future business performance, which is informed by a number of factors including economic growth, internal plans and competitor and customer activity.
Discount rates of 11% 2011 11% and 12% 2011 12% have been used in the above calculations for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively.
The profit used in the cash ows for the first year is derived from management forecasts: for years 2 to 10 a growth rate is applied.
The profit for year 10 is then assumed to apply without further growth into perpetuity.
Growth rates of between 2% 2011 2% and 5% 2011 5% have been used for Europe & North America and Asia & Rest of World respectively, representing managements best estimate of each CGUs circumstances, and these do not exceed the long term growth rates for the markets concerned.

Part of the consideration agreed with the buyer, totalling $10.0m, was in the form of a deferred payment to the Group which will be made by the buyer on or before 30 September 2014.
In the event that the buyer is unable to full his obligation, this deferred consideration is secured by an irrevocable bank guarantee held in favour of Synthomer plc by HSBC Bank plc.
In view of the security held, the Directors consider this deferred consideration virtually certain to be received and have therefore included it in these financial statements as a Non-Current Financial Asset, and within the Groups denition of Net Borrowings.
The amount of 5.6 million 2011 5.6 million included in Non-current assets represents the agreed amount of $10.0 million discounted at the rate of 5% per annum from 30 September 2014 to date of completion, plus an appropriate amount unwound on this discounting in the period up to 31 December 2012.

Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with financial institutions with a credit rating of A or higher.
22 Financial instruments The Groups treasury function operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the cash and borrowings disclosed in note 21, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in Derivative Financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Set out below is a breakdown of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: 2012 2011 Fair value Fair value through through Loans and profit Loans and profit receivables and loss receivables and loss m m m m Financial assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 137.3 145.7 Cash and cash equivalents 53.7 85.9 Financial asset 5.6 5.6 Derivatives at fair value 8.7 17.4 191.014.3 231.623.0 Derivative Derivative instruments in instruments in designated designated Amortised hedge Amortised hedge cost accounting cost accounting m m m m Financial liabilities Loan notes 56.9 87.3 Bank loans and overdrafts 143.9 160.3 Derivatives at fair value 4.3 5.6 Trade and other payables excluding accruals 145.1 146.3 345.94.3 393.95.6 68 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Carrying values Fair values at 31 December at 31 December 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Fair value of financial assets Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments 137.3 145.7 137.3 145.7 53.7 53.7 Cash and cash equivalents 85.9 85.9 Financial asset 5.6 5.6 5.6 5.6 Derivatives at fair value 8.7 17.4 8.7 17.4 205.3 254.6 205.3 254.6 Fair value of financial liabilities Loan notes 56.9 87.2 59.6 91.8 143.9 143.5 Bank loans and overdrafts 160.4 160.4 Derivatives at fair value 4.3 5.6 4.3 5.6 Trade and other payables excluding accruals 145.1 146.3 145.1 146.3 350.2 399.5 352.5 404.1 Fair values have been obtained from the relevant institutions where appropriate.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ow at prevailing interest rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximates to book value.
The fair value of the Groups financial instruments are measured using inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below, together with related disclosure required by IFRS.
Market risk The Groups main exposure to market risk is in the form of interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The policies adopted to address these risks are as follows: Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, loan notes and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows at both xed and oating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest prole in order to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
Foreign currency risk The Group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The Group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2011 none.
Impact on income statement Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts amounting to 1.7 million have been debited to the income statement in the year 2011 debit of 3.3 million.
These changes are shown separately as a special item in the consolidated income statement.
Group financial statements Synthomer plc Annual report 2012 69 22 Financial instruments continued Hedge accounting The Group has a number of cross currency swaps that are used to reduce the exposure to interest rate and currency risk.
These swaps are fully effective at eliminating the risks they address.
The Group has reviewed the requirements necessary to permit the application of hedge accounting under IAS39.
It has concluded that the costs involved in meeting these requirements cannot be justied and therefore IAS39 hedge accounting will not be applied.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments to which hedge accounting is not applied are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group has designated a number of Interest Rate Swap agreements, acquired as part of the acquisition of PolymerLatex Group, which in combination represent a oating to xed interest rate swap on a principal euro amount of 156 million, as an effective hedge against the interest rate exposure associated with a substantial portion of the Groups euro denominated, oating rate, 150 million term loan.
As such these contracts are now accounted for as Cashow Hedges as permitted by IAS39.
In addition, the Group has taken out forward foreign exchange contracts to x the sterling value of its net investments in certain foreign operations, which have a euro functional currency.
These contracts, together with 177.8 million drawn on the multicurrency term loan facility have been accounted for as net investment hedges as permitted by IAS39.
Interest rate risk prole Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Group as at 31 December 2012 was: 2012 2011 Floating rate Fixed rate Total Floating rate Fixed rate Total borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings m m m m m m Sterling 19.3 30.0 49.3 32.1 40.0 72.1 Euro 17.9 127.5 145.4 18.3 130.7 149.0 US dollar Other 13.7 13.7 37.2 157.5 194.7 64.1 170.7 234.8 Cash and cash equivalents 53.7 85.9 Financial asset see note 17 5.6 5.6 Add: special item non-recourse factoring 20.4 21.0 Net borrowings underlying performance 155.8 164.3 The effective interest rate for the year was 4.7% 2011 4.4%.

For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
The foreign currency sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the functional currency of the lender or borrower.
Liquidity risk The objective of the Group is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Synthomer plc had the following principal facilities: A committed syndicated bank facility of 210 million comprising a 150 million term loan which was drawndown in euros on completion of the PolymerLatex acquisition, and a 60 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at 31 December 2012.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 51 million raised from the US private placement market in 2004.
With maturity between 2014 and 2016, these loan notes provide the Groups long-term requirements.
