Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life as follows: leasehold improvements over the shorter of the life of the lease and the improvement: and equipment over 310 years.
Assets in the course of construction, included within leasehold improvements, were nil at year end 31 December 2011: $35 million.
The additions during the year primarily relate to the fit out of the New York office.
Reclassifications relate to the completion and capitalisation of Mans new data centre facility during the year.
From a capital perspective, leasehold improvements and equipment are supported by a combination of shareholders equity and subordinated debt for both economic and regulatory capital purposes.
Deferred compensation arrangements Man operates cash and equity settled share-based schemes as well as fund product based compensation arrangements.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Remuneration report on pages 40 to 61.
During the year, $101 million nine months to 31 December 2011: $94 million was included in compensation and distribution costs for share-based payment and deferred fund product plans, split between equity settled share-based payments of $74 million nine months to 31 December 2011: $56 million, cash-settled share-based payments totalling $4 million nine months to 31 December 2011: $7 million, and deferred fund product plans of $23 million nine months to 31 December 2011: $31 million.
In respect of equity settled share-based schemes, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense, with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
The fair value of the share awards and options granted in exchange for employee services is calculated using a binomial model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of performance conditions.
Forfeiture and early vesting are based upon historical observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the period to employees, and the assumptions used in the calculations are presented below.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted.
Changes to the original estimates, if any, are included in the Income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
For cash-settled sharebased compensation schemes, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the fair value of the liability is re-measured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the Income statement for the period, taking into account the period of vesting to date.
Man also operates compensation plans in which deferred compensation is invested in fund products managed by Man.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the fund units is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding liability.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, re-measured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying fund products at the settlement date.
