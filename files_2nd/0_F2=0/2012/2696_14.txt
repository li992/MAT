Cable&Wireless Worldwide Annual Report 2011 12 75 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 1 Statement of accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom and the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared on a going concern basis and on the historical cost basis where appropriate.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group the Group which it heads.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group consolidated financial statements contain a consolidated statement of cash flows.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 1 Cash flow statements not to present its own cash flow.
Under FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, the Company is exempt from the requirement to provide its own financial instruments disclosures on the grounds that they are included in publicly available consolidated financial statements which include disclosures that comply with the IFRS equivalent standard.
1.2 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting Policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the change has a material impact on the reported results for the period.
1.3 Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at historical cost less any impairments recognised.
Impairment reviews arecarried out whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the subsidiary may not be fully recoverable.
Impairments are determined by comparing the carrying value of the subsidiary to its recoverable amount, being the higher ofthe subsidiarys fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Fair value represents market value in an active market.
Value in use isdetermined by discounting future cash flows arising from the subsidiary with reference to the Groups own projections using pre-tax discount rates which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the Company.
Impairments are recognised in the profit and loss account.
1.4 Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The Company currently does not have any financial assets classified as held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets or assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The basis of determining fair values is set out in note 1.5.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through profit or loss.
Recognition and measurement Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets isimpaired.
Loans Loans are recognised initially at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs incurred.
Loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in profit and loss over the period of the loans using the effective interest method.
Loans are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12months after the reporting date.
Convertible bonds issued by the Company are initially recognised at fair value.
These bonds are separated into a liability and equity component.
The liability component is recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The equity component represents the residual of the fair value of the bond less the liability component.
The liability component is subsequently measured onanamortised cost basis.
76 Notes to the Company Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 1.5 Fair value estimation The nominal value less estimated impairments of receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar financial instruments.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.
1.6 Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the period and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.7 Dividends Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Companys shareholders or their payment.
1.8 Share-based payments No charges are incurred by the Company for share-based payments.
Instead, options and share awards granted to employees of itsGroup undertakings represent capital contributions to those undertakings.
An addition to the Companys investments in Group undertakings is recognised with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders funds.
The capital contribution is determined based on the fair value of the options and share awards at the date of grant and is recognised overthe vesting period.
