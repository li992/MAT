Section 5 Results for the Year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group, with disclosures including segmental information, components of the operating loss, results from discontinued operations, taxation and earnings per share.
Significant accounting judgements in this section: Deferred taxation The deferred tax liability relating to the Groups investment in Cairn India Limited, classified as an available-for-sale financial asset, is provided on the assumption that any future disposal will result in a tax liability.
Details of the impairment of intangible exploration appraisal assets can be found in section 2.2.
Key estimates and assumptions in this section: Deferred taxation Deferred tax liabilities relating to North Sea assets are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to the period when the assets are realised, based on the conditions that existed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are not adjusted for Field Allowances that certain assets in the UK may qualify for in future periods, but which are subject to Government approval of respective field development plans which did not exist at the Balance Sheet date.
Details of impairment of Goodwill and Share-based Payments can be found in sections 4.1 and 6.4 respectively.
5.1 Segmental Analysis Operating Segments For management purposes, the operations of the Cairn Group are organised based on geographical regions.
The Cairn Groups operations currently focus on new exploration activities in four key operating segments: North West Europe North Sea, Atlantic Margin Greenland, Atlantic Margin Morocco and the Mediterranean.
Geographical regions may be combined into regional business units.
Each business unit is headed by its own regional director and management monitors the results of each separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
North West Europe North Sea The corporate acquisitions in the year, with primary interests in the UK and Norwegian North Sea, provide Cairn with a core platform for growth from organic, near-term exploration, appraisal and development activities, ultimately leading to sustainable cash flow.
Atlantic Margin Greenland Cairns Greenland assets have been the focus of much of the Groups exploration activity in recent years.
Further exploration drilling is planned in 2014 subject to the necessary approvals being received.
Other The Atlantic Margin Morocco and Mediterranean operating segments results have been combined into the Other Cairn Energy reportable segment together with the Groups remaining exploration and corporate assets.
New exploration opportunities in Morocco have been added through corporate acquisitions and farm-in agreements during the year.
Cairns presence in the Atlantic Margin has increased post year end with the Senegal farm-in.
The discontinued operations of the Cairn India Group were a separate business unit up to the point of disposal in 2011.

The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.

In previous years, the reconciliation was based on the weighted average rate of corporate taxation applying to the group based on its worldwide activities for the year concerned.
The change has been adopted to facilitate comparison between the tax expenses or credits applying to different years.
The 2011 reconciliation shown above has been restated as a result of this change.
The UK main rate of corporation tax was 26% prior to 1 April 2012, and 24% from that date onwards.
The reduction in the tax rate from 26% to 24% has resulted in an average rate of corporation tax of 24.5% for the year ended 31 December 2012, as shown above.
The rate will reduce to 23% on 1 April 2013 and to 21% on 1 April 2014. c Factors that may affect future corporation tax charges At 31 December 2012, Cairn had losses of approximately $64.8m 2011: $nil available for offset against future Ring Fence trading profits chargeable to UK Corporation Tax.
In addition there are surplus management expenses of $319.6m 2011: $324.1m and non-trade deficits of $0.7m 2011: $66.5m available for offset against future investment income.
Under UK tax law, tax losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely.
At 31 December 2012, Cairn had Norwegian tax losses carried forward of $7.3m 2011: $nil, all of which is relievable at the ordinary Norwegian corporate tax rate of 28%, and $3.2m 2011: $nil is also relievable at the additional special Norwegian tax rate of 50% applicable to certain profits from oil and gas activities.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely for use against future profits.
Section 5.5 d provides further information in connection with losses recognised for deferred tax purposes.
As at 31 December 2012, it is anticipated that the Group will be eligible for Field Allowances in the UK which will reduce the Ring Fence profits chargeable to Supplementary Charge.
Field Allowances will only be granted when DECC approves a field development plan and claimed when production commences.
