Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements 59 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 Accounting policies continued Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a rm commitment fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash ow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ows of the hedged items.
The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash ow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses or finance income expense in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash ow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
d Derivatives that are not designated as hedges Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash ows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are obtained from valuations provided by financial institutions.
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Operating leases As lessee Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a dened benefit scheme and a number of dened contribution schemes.
The liability recognised in respect of the dened benefit scheme represents the present value of the dened benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The assets of this scheme are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The dened benefit schemes assets are measured using fair values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups dened benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit schemes net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Groups contributions to dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012 60 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience.
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where amounts provided are payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Share-based charges relating to employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes: i Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS are granted at market value.
A charge is booked to the income statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings.
The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
ii Share options granted under the Long Term Retention Plan LTRP are granted at par value.
The charge to the income statement for LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
iii The Group has a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and certain senior executives.
Participants are awarded shares dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period.
For those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
iv The Group has a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP for senior management.
Participants are paid a cash bonus dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards and is linked to movements in the Groups share price.
The charge is spread over the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in liabilities.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classied as equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
Segmental reporting The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, the Groups CEO.
The Groups reportable segments are Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS.
The CODM measures the operating performance of these segments using EBITA earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reports provided to the CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.

Under IFRS 11, proportional consolidation will not be permitted and therefore from 1 January 2014 the Group will account for its interests in joint ventures using equity accounting.
The use of equity accounting will have no impact on Group profit for the year or earnings per share, but will impact the presentation of the Groups interests in joint ventures in the income statement and in the balance sheet.
The revision to IAS 19 will not have a material impact on the financial statements although it is expected that the net finance cost in the income statement will increase in future periods see note 29 for further details.
The Group has yet to assess the full impact of the other new standards and amendments but does not expect them to have a material impact on the financial statements.

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to owners of the parent divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held by the Groups employee share trusts.
For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012 70 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 8 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Value-in-use calculations have been prepared for each CGU using the cash ow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management for 2013 2014.
Cash ows beyond this period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% per annum for a further three-year period.
A terminal value is applied thereafter in order to calculate long-term estimated cash ows using the same anticipated long-term growth rate of 3% across all CGUs.
The growth rate used does not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The cash ows have been discounted using pre-tax discount rates appropriate for each CGU.

The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU.
$1.9m of goodwill, which relates to a market from which the Group is exiting, has been written off during the year.
$46.2m of goodwill was impaired during 2011.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the discount rates are 1% higher than those above in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
This analysis did not identify any further impairment.
In 2011, the goodwill impairment test was performed using budgeted and extrapolated cash ows for a 20-year period.
In addition, the 2011 impairment test utilised a single discount rate of 10% for all CGUs.
Intangibles arising on acquisition include the valuation of customer contracts and customer relationships recognised on business combinations.
Development costs with a net book value of $20.8m 2011: $22.9m are internally generated intangible assets.

John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012 78 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash ow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specic areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geo-political uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Where practical, the Group hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Other strategies, including the payment of dividends, are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the revenues of the Groups businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2012 2011:10%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $10.6m higher or lower 2011: $10.6m.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2012 2011:10%, exchange differences in equity would have been $48.0m 2011: $28.8m higher or lower respectively.
10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
ii Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at oating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into xed rates to generate the desired interest prole and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate uctuations.
At 31 December 2012, 19% 2011: 47% of the Groups borrowings were at xed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2012 2011: 1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $1.9m higher or lower respectively 2011: $1.3m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups operations comprise three divisions, Wood Group Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS each made up of a number of businesses.
Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency.
Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufciently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements 79 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 17 Financial instruments continued Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
There is significant management focus on receivables that are overdue.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
100% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2012 2011: 74% was held with such institutions.
c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2012, 96% 2011: 91% of the Groups borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
In February 2013, the Group increased its bilateral facilities from $800m to $950m, with the maturity date being extended to February 2018. d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing EBITA from continuing operations by net finance expense from continuing operations before exceptional items.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2012 was 35.7 times 2011: 38.8 times.
The ratio of net debt to continuing EBITDA at 31 December 2012 was 0.31 2011: 0.01.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows.
Draw-downs under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and are not therefore discounted and loan interest payable is excluded from the amounts below.

Draw-downs under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $192.7m 2011: $147.6m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the LongTerm Retention Plan LTRP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Long Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP.
Further details of these schemes is provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The charge to operating profit in 2012 for these schemes amounted to $26.2m 2011: $19.2m.
$19.6m 2011: $16.0m of the total charge is credited to retained earnings and $6.6m 2011: $3.2m, relating to the LTCIP, is included in other non-current liabilities as the LTCIP is a cash settled scheme.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below: ESOS and LTRP Around 1,200 employees participate in these schemes.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%- 40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk-free rate of return is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
The rate used ranges from 0.5% to 4.4%.
A dividend yield of between 1.0% and 2.0% has been used in the calculations.
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year was 2.09 2011: 1.62.
The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the year was 6.43 2011: 4.94 to 6.38.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2012 is 5.6 years 2011: 5.7 years.
LTIP The share-based charge for the LTIP was calculated using a fair value of 4.12 for the first cycle, 1.81 for the second cycle, 3.01 for the third cycle, 5.10 for the fourth cycle and 6.18 for the fifth cycle.
The charge for market-related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk-free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2012 82 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 20 Share-based charges continued LTCIP The share-based charge for the LTCIP was calculated using a fair value of 7.01 2011: 6.18.
The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above.
Payments under the LTCIP are linked to movements in the Groups share price.
Share options are granted at an exercise price equal to the average mid-market price of the shares on the three days prior to the date of grant.
1,964,000 options were granted during the year, 1,438,477 options were exercised during the year and 588,451 options lapsed during the year.
The weighted average share price for ESOS options exercised during the year was 7.59 2011: 6.49.
Options granted to directors under the executive share option scheme are subject to performance criteria as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report.
No options have been granted to executive directors since 2009.
There are no performance criteria under this scheme for options granted to employees.
The basis of the scheme is that an overall bonus pool is calculated annually based on performance criteria that consider the growth in the Groups adjusted earnings per share in the prior year.
There are no performance criteria attached to the exercise of options under the LTRP.
928,500 LTRP options were granted during the year, 1,279,681 LTRP options were exercised during the year and 325,604 LTRP options lapsed during the year.
The weighted average share price for LTRP options exercised during the year was 7.51 2011: 6.52.
Further details on the LTRP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP has been in place since 2008.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors and certain senior executives are awarded shares dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the LTIP are EBITA, OCER ratio of operating capital employed to revenue, total shareholder return and adjusted diluted earnings per share.
The LTIP awards are in the form of shares and forfeitable restricted shares.
20% of any award earned over the three year performance cycle are deferred for a further two years in the form of forfeitable restricted shares.
At 31 December 2012, 4,448,914 shares were potentially issuable under this scheme.
Further details of the LTIP are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

During the year the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Mitchells Oileld Services Inc Mitchells and 100% of the share capital of Duval.
The acquisitions are not considered to be material to the Group on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
The acquisitions of Mitchells and Duval provide the Group with access to the oil-rich Eagle Ford and Bakken shale regions in the USA, strengthening the Groups capabilities in the US onshore market.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups resources to further grow and develop their businesses.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
Provisional fair value adjustments of $57.6m, representing the fair value of customer contracts, have been recorded in relation to the acquisitions made in the year.
Adjustments of $7.6m have been made in respect of the provisional fair value adjustments recorded in 2011 and consequently goodwill has increased by this amount.
These adjustments made are not considered material to the financial statements and the comparative balance sheet has therefore not been restated.

Divestments On 4 April 2012, the Group divested its aero engine overhaul business and in May 2012, the Group completed the disposal of a Well Support business in the Middle East, the sale of which was agreed at the time of the Well Support divestment in April 2011.
In total, proceeds of $43.0m were received for these two businesses.
The assets and liabilities disposed of were reclassied as gross assets and liabilities held for sale in the Group balance sheet at 31 December 2011.
Property, plant and equipment with a book value of $1.3m that was part of one of these divestments was not reclassied as held for sale at that time as it was anticipated that the Group would retain ownership of those assets.

29 Retirement benefit liabilities One of the Groups pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benets Scheme, is a dened benefit scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2010 by a professionally qualied actuary.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2012 2011 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 5.00 4.90 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.00 2.90 Discount rate 4.50 4.80 Expected return on scheme assets 6.27 7.00 The expected return on scheme assets for 2012 is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
From 1 January 2013, the expected return on scheme assets will be set at a rate equivalent to the discount rate.
The impact of this change will be to reduce the expected return and thus increase the net finance cost in the income statement in future periods.
The impact in 2013 is estimated to be $2.4m.
At 31 December 2012 the actuary has determined pension liabilities by reference to a standard actuarial mortality table which considered UK-wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
Those observed mortality rates have been projected to improve at a specic rate into the future to allow for established trends and expectations in line with normal actuarial practice.
Specically, the actuarial table used was PXA00 and improvements were in line with the long cohort approach with an annual underpin of 1% p. a.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: 2012 2011 $m $m Present value of funded obligations 246.1 206.7 Fair value of scheme assets 191.1 160.9 Net liabilities 55.0 45.8 Our business Operational review Governance Financial statements 91 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2012 29 Retirement benefit liabilities continued The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2012 2011 % % Equity securities 82.9 83.4 Corporate bonds 8.4 7.7 Gilts 8.3 8.6 Cash 0.4 0.3 The amounts recognised in the income statement are as follows: 2012 2011 $m $m Current service cost included within employee benets expense 7.4 7.8 Interest cost 10.4 10.8 Expected return on scheme assets 10.5 11.3 Total included within finance income 0.1 0.5 The employee benets expense is included within administrative expenses in the income statement.
