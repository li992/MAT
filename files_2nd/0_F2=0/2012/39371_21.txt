These are designed to reflect solely the costs associated with the operation of the Company as a collective investment fund.
The Group's total expenses include the cost of the profitable Spencer House banqueting subsidiary as well as other costs which are recharged to third parties.
In accordance with the AIC methodology we have adjusted for these as well as one-off items or other items that do not directly relate to the investment activity.
We have treated the cost of our compensation schemes as analogous to performance fees.
As a result of the change in year end, the Ongoing Charges % has been estimated using the nine month expenses of 20.2 million, adjusted to remove those costs which do not meet the AIC definition and to reflect an estimate of a full-year total.
The adjusted total costs are 18.8 million as set out below: Period ended Year ended 31 December 31 March 2012 2012 million million Total expenses 20.2 24.6 Adjustment to remove costs in accordance with the AIC methodology 4.1 5.7 Ongoing charges in period 16.1 18.9 1 Adjustment to estimate annualised costs 2.7 Ongoing charges 18.8 18.9 Average net assets 1,838.1 1,952.0 Ongoing charges 1.02% 0.97% 2 Performance fees 0.17% 0.13% Ongoing charges including performance fees 1.19% 1.10% 1 The estimate of annual costs takes into account non-recurring items.
