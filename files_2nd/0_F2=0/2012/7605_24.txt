Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 62 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and those International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC Interpretations.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and those financial assets and financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss.
As permitted under IFRS 3, the balance sheet at 31 December 2011 has been restated to recognise additional goodwill of 1.4m and a reduction in inventories of 1.4m on the acquisition of Hunting Titan on 16 September 2011.
The balance sheet at 1January 2011 has not been presented, as there was no impact on the previous years numbers from this adjustment.
The 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities have been restated to offset balances where there is a legally enforceable right to offset.
The balance sheet at 1 January 2011 has not been presented as the figures previously reported for deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities do not require adjustment.
In addition, the current tax assets and current tax liabilities have been restated in the 2011 Consolidated Balance Sheet to reflect the underlying position within each tax jurisdiction.
The balance sheet at 1 January 2011 has not been presented, as the figures previously reported for the current tax assets and current tax liabilities do not require adjustment.
Where a change in the presentational format between the prior year and current year financial statements has been made during the period, comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out in note 45.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
Adoption of New Standards, Amendments and Interpretations There are no new IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 January 2012 that have a material impact on the Groups financial performance or position.
The Group has early adopted the amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income, issued June 2011.
The presentation of items in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been altered to show items which will or might potentially be reclassified from other comprehensive income into profit or loss separately from those for which reclassification is not permitted.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective Subsequent to the Year End IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendment to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Improvements to IFRSs 2009-2011 May 2012 Not yet endorsed by the European Union.
New requirements contained within International Reporting Standards, referred to above, are not expected to significantly impact the Groups results or financial position.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements and assumptions about the future, resulting in the use of accounting estimates.
These will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results and adjustments will consequently be necessary.
Estimates are continually evaluated, based on experience, consultation with experts and reasonable expectations of future events.
Accounting estimates are applied in determining the carrying amounts of the following significant assets and liabilities: Asset liability Nature of Estimates Goodwill The Group has capitalised goodwill of 304.5m at 31 December 2012 2011 317.9m, as shown in note 16.
The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine value in use.
In calculating the value in use, significant management judgement is required in forecasting relevant cash flows considering factors such as long-term growth rates, future margins, timing and quantum of future replacement capital expenditure, future tax rates and the selection of discount rates to reflect the risks involved.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets include the Groups aggregate amounts spent on the acquisition of customer relationships, patented and unpatented technology, trademarks and other intangibles.
At 31 December 2012, intangible assets amounted to 185.2m 2011 220.8m, as shown in note 17, and represented 23% 2011 30% of the Groups net assets.
These assets have principally arisen from the Groups acquisitions.
The relative size of the Groups other intangible assets makes the judgements regarding the initial recognition, useful economic lives and potential impairments significant to the Groups financial position and performance.
The fair value of these assets is determined by discounting estimated future net cash flows generated by the asset.
The use of different assumptions for the expectations of future cash flows and the discount rate could change the valuation of the intangible assets.
Management also utilises judgement in estimating the lives of these assets and in considering whether any indicators of impairment have arisen.
Provisions The main components of the provisions relate to warranties, tax indemnities and onerous contracts, as shown in note 27.
On the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, accounting estimates and judgements were applied in determining the amount of provisions held for tax indemnities.
Following the favourable settlement of a legacy tax dispute by the relevant judicial and tax authorities in Canada, these provisions have significantly reduced during the year.
The timing and amounts payable in respect of retained provisions remains uncertain.
The Group has commitments in respect of leasehold properties, some of which are not used for Group trading purposes and are vacant or sub-let to third parties.
The provision for onerous contracts reflects the uncertainty of future conditions in the sub-letting market.
The Group uses the present value of future cash flows to determine the carrying value of provisions.
Judgement is used in forecasting relevant cash flows.
Deferred tax Deferred tax balances are derived from assumptions, which include the future utilisation of trading losses and provisions at assumed tax rates.
Share-based payments A number of assumptions are made in determining the fair value of awards at the grant date and at each subsequent reporting date for LTIPs, as shown in note 38.
In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers.
Post-employment The Groups accounting policy for defined benefit pension schemes requires management to benefits make judgements as to the nature of benefits provided by each scheme and thereby determine the classification of each scheme.
For defined benefit schemes, management is required to make annual estimates and assumptions about future returns on classes of scheme assets, future remuneration changes, administration costs, changes in benefits, inflation rates, exchange rates, life expectancy and expected remaining periods of service of employees.
The assumptions are shown in note 32.
In making these estimates and assumptions, management considers advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
Where actual experience differs to these estimates, actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.

Segmental Reporting Group The Group reports on seven operating segments, two of which are discontinued operations, in its internal management reports, which are used to make strategic decisions.
The Groups segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services to international oil and gas companies and the shipping sector.
The discontinued operations comprise Field Aviation, which was sold on 27 April 2012 and Gibson Energy, which was sold in 2008.
Gibson Energy continues to generate accounting entries due to sale related transactions and is required for reconciliation purposes.
The Well Construction segment provides products and services used by customers for the drilling phase of oil and gas wells, along with associated equipment used by the underground construction industry for telecommunication infrastructure build-out and precision machining services for the energy, aviation and power generation sectors.
The Well Completion segment provides products and services used by customers for the completion phase of oil and gas wells.
The Well Intervention segment provides products and services used by customers for the production, maintenance and restoration of existing oil and gas wells.
The Exploration and Production segment includes the Groups oil and gas exploration and production activities in the Southern US and offshore Gulf of Mexico.
The Board of Hunting has reviewed the strategic rationale of the Exploration and Production division and from 2013 will not be making any new capital investment, beyond where the division has contractual commitments.
The division will in future focus on producing out its remaining reserves, with a view to winding down the operation.
As a result, Exploration and Production is now presented within other operating divisions.
Gibson Shipbrokers is a global energy shipping broker headquartered in London.
Crude oil, fuel oil and bio fuels are shipped along with dry bulk such as coal, iron ore and grain.
Gibson Shipbrokers is also involved in the shipping of liquefied petroleum gas LPG, petrochemicals and liquefied natural gas LNG.
The following tables present the results of the operating segments on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group measures the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and profit from operations, before exceptional items and the amortisation of intangible assets.
Accounting policies used for segment reporting reflect those used for the Group.
Inter-segment sales are priced on an arms length basis.
Costs and overheads incurred centrally are apportioned to the continuing operating segments on the basis of time attributed to those operations by senior executives.

This uplift is charged to the income statement as the inventory is sold, thereby reducing reported operating profits.
In 2012, the charge was 7.6m relating to the four acquisitions completed in the second half of 2011.
The impairment charge of 5.2m 2011 1.0m relates to the write down of oil and gas development expenditure, largely due to sustained low natural gas commodity prices during the year and forecast for the foreseeable future.
The recoverable amount of oil and gas development expenditure is based on value in use.
These calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on estimated oil and gas reserves, future production and income attributable to such reserves.
Cash flows are based on reserve production lives varying from one to fifteen years.
Cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax rate of 10% 2011 10%.
The prices of oil and natural gas are derived from published futures prices, with the long-term average oil price assumed to be US$98.13 bbl.
and the long-term average gas price at US$4.35 mcf 2011 US$4.07 mcf.
Natural declines in well production rates, combined with low forecast product prices, materially decreased the present value of future cash flows and rendered development and production of certain older offshore wells uneconomical, resulting in the impairment charge of 5.2m.
Dry hole costs of 2.0m have been incurred during the year from our Exploration and Production activities.
A 1.1m charge for bonuses for key employee retention, relating to the 2011 acquisitions, has been recognised.
All relevant employees have been paid their bonuses in the period and the liability has been discharged.
A credit of 1.1m has been recognised in the income statement for the Doffing contingent consideration arrangement, as the future payments are not likely to be required.

Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24% to 23% is included in the Finance Act 2012, which received Royal Assent on 17 July 2012.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 2% per annum to 21% by 1 April 2014.

Huntings midstream services operation, was completed on 12 December 2008.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax disputes with the Canadian Tax Authorities CRA.
The CRA have now ended their enquiry into the larger of the two tax disputes and have dropped their challenge resulting in a gain to the income statement of 56.9m, comprising of a release of 30.7m provisions held in respect of the dispute, a refund of approximately 25.9m in cash, for payments which were made in response to corporation tax reassessments issued by the CRA in respect of this tax dispute and other movements on Gibson Energy related provisions in the year giving rise to a net credit of 0.3m.
The refund of cash involves the Federal and Provincial tax authorities in Canada.
Receipt of the Federal portion, amounting to 17.2m was received in December 2012 and receipt of the Provincial portion, approximately 8.7m, was received on 28 February 2013.
On the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, part of the consideration was deferred and held as a warrant until its receipt in full in 2011.
Upon receipt, the proceeds were treated as a taxable revenue item and taxed accordingly.
In 2012, the UK tax authorities agreed that the underlying nature of the transaction is capital.
The company has utilised capital tax losses to offset the capital gain arising on the warrant, resulting in a nil tax charge on the warrant.
The tax charge previously recognised, together with provisions, has been released.
Field Aviation On 27 April 2012, the Group sold its aviation engineering services business, Hunting Canadian Airport Holdings Ltd and its subsidiaries, including Field Aviation Company Inc. together referred to as Field Aviation.
Field Aviation is considered to be a major operation of Hunting and as such the results have been presented as a discontinued operation.
Hunting Energy France On 22December 2009, the Group sold Hunting Energy France SA, its French-based business.

Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to Ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of outstanding Ordinary shares is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary shares.
The dilution in respect of share options applies where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys Ordinary shares during the year and the possible issue of shares under the Groups long-term incentive plans.

The net book amount at 1 January 2011 was 100.6m.
Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs, the individual business operations, as follows: Restated 2012 2011 m m Innova 42.3 44.2 Dearborn 15.7 16.4 Titan 176.6 185.0 Welltonic 11.6 11.6 Hunting Stafford formerly National Coupling Company 20.1 21.0 Other cash generating units 38.2 39.7 At 31 December 304.5 317.9 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates.
The calculations use discounted pre-tax cash flow projections based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management covering a two year period and are based on past experience and order books.
Cash flows beyond the two year period are extrapolated using estimated nominal long-term growth rates of 6.8% and 8.0% and terminal growth rates of 2.7% and 3.0% for 2012 and 2011 respectively.
The growth rate reflects the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU operates and will incorporate, where relevant, projected rig counts and the expected profile of drilling.
Cash flows are discounted using nominal pre-tax rates between 10% and 15% 2011 11% and 15%.
The cash flows for the Titan CGU have been discounted using a nominal pre-tax rate of 11% 2011 11%.
The discount rate best reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, the risks associated with the cash flows and the likely external rate of borrowing of the CGU.
Consideration has also been given to other factors such as currency risk, operational risk and country risk.
The operations of Well Intervention have been combined with the operations of Welltonic and so goodwill relating to Well Intervention, which was previously disclosed separately, has been reallocated to the Welltonic CGU.
Sensitivities Having performed a sensitivity analysis on the value in use calculations, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any CGU to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Trade and Other Receivables continued Group Trade receivables that are not overdue and not impaired are expected to be fully recovered as there is no recent history of default or any indications that the customers will not meet their payment obligations.
At the year-end there are no trade receivables 2011 none whose terms have been renegotiated and would otherwise be past due or impaired.
At 31 December 2012, trade receivables of 61.6m 2011 52.0m were overdue but not impaired.
The ageing of these receivables at the year-end is as follows: Number of days overdue: 2012 2011 m m 130 days 33.9 29.0 3160 days 15.6 12.5 6190 days 6.3 7.0 91120 days 4.6 2.5 more than 120 days 1.2 1.0 Receivables overdue not impaired 61.6 52.0 Receivables not overdue and not impaired 82.1 100.6 Receivables not overdue and impaired 1.1 1.0 Receivables overdue and impaired 1.2 1.2 Impairment 2.3 2.2 Net trade receivables 143.7 152.6 Receivables that are overdue but not impaired relate to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
Impaired receivables mainly relate to debtors in financial difficulty where defaults in payments have occurred or concerns have been raised about the customers liquidity.
Trade receivables are impaired when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of sale.
During the year, a provision of 1.4m 2011 1.3m for the impairment of receivables was recognised, 0.6m 2011 0.3m receivables were written off and 0.6m 2011 0.4m unused provisions were released.
After recognising foreign exchange gains of 0.1m 2011 0.1m gains, the provision for the impairment of trade receivables at the year end was 2.3m 2011 2.2m.
The other classes of financial assets within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups wide and unrelated customer base.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is the fair value of each class of receivable, as shown in note 29.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security and no assets have been acquired through the exercise of any collateral previously held.
Company None 2011 none of the Companys trade and other receivables were past due at the year end and the Company does not consider it necessary to provide for any impairments.

Provision is made on a discounted basis, at a risk-free rate of between 0.25% and 1.8% pa, for the net rental deficit on these properties to the end of the lease term.
Asset decommissioning and remediation obligations relate to the Groups obligation to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant and equipment.
The provision reflects uncertainty in the timing and amounts of the costs expected to arise in meeting this obligation.
Provision is made on a discounted basis and is expected to be utilised over a period of one to eighteen years.
Following the sale of Gibson Energy in 2008, Hunting established provisions for tax indemnities given in respect of two tax disputes with the Canadian Tax Authorities CRA.
The CRA have now ended their enquiry into the larger of the two tax disputes and have dropped their challenge resulting in the release of 30.7m provisions held in respect of the dispute.
Other tax warranty provisions of 2.2m have also been released.
This has been shown as part of discontinued operations note 13.
Provisions of 7.7m continue to be retained in respect of the smaller tax dispute and are expected to be utilised in 2013.
Derivatives and Hedging Group a Currency Derivatives The Group has used spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements during the year.
At 31 December 2012, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is 3.7m 2011 15.9m.
Gains and losses on contracts that are not designated in a hedge relationship are taken directly to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a 0.2m loss 2011 0.1m have been recognised in the income statement during the year for continuing operations.
Certain highly probable forecast transactions have been designated in a cash flow hedge relationship and hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
These forecast transactions are expected to occur at various dates during the next six months.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve on forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2012 will be recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Losses of 0.5m 2011 5.4m gain were recognised in the hedging reserve note 34 during the year.
No gains or losses 2011 6.3m gains were removed from equity during the year, with no gains or losses 2011 0.8m gains included in revenue included in the income statement.

Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk and cash flow interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to mitigate potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge certain risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign Exchange Risk The Groups international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly in respect of US dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
The Groups material foreign exchange rates are: US dollar Canadian dollar 2012 2011 2012 2011 Average exchange rate to sterling 1.59 1.60 1.58 1.59 Year-end exchange rate to sterling 1.63 1.55 1.62 1.58 Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 92 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial Risk Management continued i Transactional Risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts have been designated as hedging instruments of highly probable forecast transactions.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Currency exposures arise where the cash flows are not in the functional currency of the entity.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are committed foreign currency transactions greater than 250,000 equivalent per month and or currency flows that in aggregate exceed 500,000 equivalent per annum.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes available for sale financial assets, derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge, borrowings designated in a hedge of the net investment in its US subsidiaries and loans to subsidiaries that are considered to be part of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Financial Risk Management continued ii Translational Risk Foreign exchange risk also arises from the Groups investments in foreign operations.
Average rate options are used to reduce translation risk on the Groups consolidated profit before tax by hedging the translation of approximately 50% of budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
These derivatives are not designated as a hedge.
The foreign exposure to net investments in foreign operations is managed using borrowings denominated in the same functional currency as that of the hedged assets.
The borrowings are designated as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations.
The foreign exchange exposure primarily arises from US dollar denominated net investments.
b Interest Rate Risk Variable interest rates on cash at bank, deposits, overdrafts and borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest risk and fixed interest rates on loans and deposits expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The treasury function manages the Groups exposure to interest rate risk and has used interest rate swaps and caps, when considered appropriate.
c Credit Risk The Groups credit risk arises from its available for sale financial assets, pension assets, cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivative financial instruments and outstanding receivables.
At the year end, the Group had credit risk exposures to a wide range of counterparties.
Credit risk exposure is continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered to be significant in the context of the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Exposure limits are set for each approved counterparty, as well as the types of transactions that may be entered into.
Approved institutions that the treasury function can invest surplus cash with all must have a minimum of an A1, P1 or F1 short-term rating from Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch rating agencies and AAA rating for Money Market Funds.
The majority of cash and cash equivalents, which total 101.7m 2011 68.8m at the year end, and investments of 3.2m 20112.4m have been deposited with banks with Fitch short-term ratings of F1 to F1.
All cash and cash equivalents and investments are expected to be fully recovered.
The credit risk of foreign exchange contracts is calculated before the contract is acquired and compared to the credit risk limit set for each counterparty.
Credit risk is calculated as a fixed percentage of the nominal value of the instrument.
Trade and other receivables are continuously monitored.
Credit account limits are primarily based on the credit quality of the customer and past experience through trading relationships.
To reduce credit risk exposure from outstanding receivables, the Group has taken out credit insurance with an external insurer, subject to certain conditions.
The Company operates a pension scheme in the UK, which includes a funded defined benefit section with pension plan net assets of 6.0m 2011 4.8m.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are now covered by insurance company annuity policies, meaning the pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
The pension buy-in has been effected by using three insurers, so as to spread its credit risk.
The credit rating of these insurers is monitored.
The Company also operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the US, which is unfunded.
Contributions are paid into a separate investment vehicle and invested in a wide portfolio of US mutual funds that are recognised by the Company as noncurrent investments.
Investments at the year end amounted to 3.5m 2011 2.9m and are expected to be fully recovered.
d Liquidity Risk The Group needs to ensure that it has sufficient liquid funds available to support its working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
All subsidiaries submit weekly and bi-monthly treasury reports to the treasury function to enable them to monitor the Groups requirements.
The Group has sufficient credit facilities to meet both its long and short-term requirements.
The Groups credit facilities are provided by a variety of funding sources and total 416.2m 2011 423.6m at the year end.
The facilities comprise 375.0m 2011 375.0m of committed facilities and 41.2m 2011 48.6m of uncommitted facilities.
Of the uncommitted facilities, 0.2m 2011 0.4m is secured on the machinery that the loan was used to purchase and 41.0m 201148.2m is unsecured.
The 375.0m committed facility is unsecured.
The committed facilities comprise the 375.0m multi-currency loan facility from a syndicate of ten banks.
This facility expires on 5 August 2016.
A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn amount.
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 94 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial Risk Management continued The Groups treasury function maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit facilities.
The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at the year-end: 2012 2011 m m Floating rate: Expiring between two and five years 187.2 128.5 Surplus funds are placed in short-term deposits with approved banks and with AAA rated Money Market Funds.
The Group also has a letter of credit facility for 1.3m, which is secured by funds held on deposit of 0.8m.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis The following sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Groups and Companys financial instruments and show the impact on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at 31 December 2012.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the cash and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies remain unchanged from the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2012.
The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
The following assumptions have been made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Foreign exchange rate and interest rate sensitivities have an asymmetric impact on the Groups results, that is, an increase in rates does not result in the same amount of movement as a decrease in rates.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is assumed to be outstanding for the whole year.
Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the purpose of this analysis.
The carrying values of financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost do not change as interest rates change.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Financial Instruments: Sensitivity Analysis continued i Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 0.25% 2011 0.5% for US interest rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future interest rates.
Group The table below shows the post-tax impact for the year on the Groups profit for an increase and decrease in interest rates, with all other variables unchanged, at 31 December.

There is no impact on equity for a change in interest rates.
Company The post-tax impact on the income statement, with all other variables held constant, at 31 December, for an increase of 0.25% 2011 0.25% in the UK interest rate, is to reduce profits by 0.1m 2011 0.1m.
If the UK interest rate were to decrease by 0.25% 2011 0.25%, then the post-tax impact would be to increase profits by 0.1m 2011 0.1m.
The movements arise on sterling loans from subsidiaries.
ii Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity rate of 10% 2011 10% for US dollar and Canadian dollar exchange rates represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historical volatility and a review of analysts research and banks expectations of future foreign exchange rates.

There is no impact on equity from a change in the US dollar exchange rate.
Post-Employment Benefits Pensions Within the UK, the Group operates a funded pension scheme, which includes a defined benefit section with benefits linked to final salary and a defined contribution section with benefits dependent on future investment returns.
With effect from 31December 2002, the defined benefit section was closed to new UK employees who are offered membership of the defined contribution section.
The majority of UK employees are members of one of these arrangements.
The majority of the Schemes defined benefits are covered by insurance policies, meaning that pensions-related risks have largely been eliminated.
This is demonstrated by the stability of the pension asset from year to year.
However, the obligation ultimately rests with the Group.
During the year, the Trustees paid additional funds into the existing insurance policies to secure further benefits for members.
A valuation of the defined benefit section of the Scheme was produced and updated to 31 December 2012 by independent qualified actuaries.
The main assumptions used for IAS 19 purposes at 31 December were: 2012 2011 Annual rates Rate of increase in salaries 5.1% 5.2% Rate of increase in pensions 3.1% 3.2% Discount rate 4.3% 4.7% Inflation RPI 3.1% 3.2% The post-employment mortality assumptions allow for future improvements in mortality.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old male currently has an expected future lifetime of 24.5 years 2011 24.3 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.6 years 2011 27.4 years for a male reaching 65 in 20 years time.
The mortality table implies that a 65 year old female currently has an expected future lifetime of 25.9 years 2011 25.8 years and an expected future lifetime of 27.8 years 2011 27.7 years for a female reaching 65 in 20 years time.
Based upon past experience, pension increases have been assumed to be in line with RPIinflation.
The expected rate of return on assets for the year ending 31 December 2012 was 4.6% pa based on financial conditions as at 31 December 2011.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is generally determined as managements best estimate of the long-term return on the major asset classes weighted by the actual allocation of assets at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return on the insurance policies has been set equal to the discount rate.

In accordance with IAS19 and IFRS13, the insurance policy held to meet the obligations in respect of active members of the Scheme has been valued by discounting the expected future payments from the policy using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used to value the obligations for active members.
During the year to 31 December 2012, contributions by the Group of 1.3m 2011 1.1m were also made to the UK defined contribution section of the Scheme.
For 2013, the Group will pay estimated contributions of 3.8m to the defined benefit section of the Scheme.
Contributions to the defined contribution section of the Scheme are in addition.
Surplus in the Plan The following amounts were measured in accordance with IAS 19: 2012 2011 m m Total fair value of plan assets 254.8 238.0 Present value of obligations 248.8 233.2 Asset recognised in the balance sheet 6.0 4.8 Movements in the Present Value of the Defined Benefit Obligation 2012 2011 m m Change in present value of obligation: Present value of obligation at the start of the year 233.2 218.4 Current service cost employer 2.0 2.1 Interest cost 10.8 11.6 Contributions by plan participants 0.4 0.4 Actuarial losses 13.2 11.2 Benefits paid 10.8 10.5 Present value of obligation at the end of the year 248.8 233.2 Movements in the Fair Value of Plan Assets 2012 2011 m m Change in plan assets: Fair value of plan assets at the start of the year 238.0 223.9 Expected return on plan assets 10.8 11.7 Actuarial gain on plan assets 12.4 9.3 Contributions by plan participants 0.4 0.4 Contributions by employer 4.0 3.2 Benefits paid 10.8 10.5 Fair value of plan assets at the end of the year 254.8 238.0 For 2012, the actual return on the plan assets amounted to a gain of 23.2m 2011 21.0m.
The gain arising as a result of the increase in the value placed on the insurance annuity policies is offset by a corresponding increase in the value placed on the corresponding liabilities.
This effect is seen in the actuarial losses on the defined benefit obligations stated above.

Members build up benefits in this arrangement by way of notional contributions and notional investment returns.
Actual contributions are paid into an entirely separate investment vehicle held by the Company, which is used to pay benefits due from the cash balance arrangement when the member retires.
Under IAS 19 the cash balance arrangement is accounted for as an unfunded defined benefit scheme.
At 31 December 2012, total obligations arising from the scheme were 3.5m 2011 2.9m and movements during the year comprised a service cost equal to the notional contributions of 0.1m 2011 0.1m, an interest cost of 0.1m 2011 0.1m, an actuarial loss representing the excess of notional investment returns over the interest cost of 0.5m 2011 0.2m gain, benefits paid of nil 2011 0.1m and a foreign exchange gain of 0.1m 2011 0.1m loss.
Company The Company has no employees and therefore does not participate in any of the above schemes, although it does guarantee the contributions due by the participating employers.

Capital Risk Management The Groups capital consists of equity and net debt.
2012 2011 m m Total equity 813.8 732.0 Net debt 163.8 218.4 Capital employed 977.6 950.4 Gearing 20% 30% Capital employed is managed with the aim of maintaining an appropriate level of financing available for the Groups activities.
The balance of debt and equity, as reflected in the gearing ratio, which is net debt expressed as a percentage of total equity, is managed having due regard to the respective cost of funds and their availability.
The Groups net debt is monitored on a daily basis and is managed by the control of working capital, dividend and capital expenditure payments and the purchase and disposal of assets and businesses.
The level of net debt and related gearing ratio of 20% at 31 December 2012 is considered comfortable, with adequate headroom remaining, giving management ongoing flexibility.
For debt funding, the Group ensures that banking and other borrowing covenants are complied with, and that appropriate forecast headroom exists, to ensure that borrowing facilities remain in place.
The main financial covenants attached to the 375m committed bank facility require EBITDA to cover net finance charges by a minimum of 4 times and net debt to be no more than 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA permitted will reduce to 3 times in June 2013 and will remain at that level until the facility expires in 2016.
For bank covenant testing purposes, the Groups EBITDA is adjusted to include the share of associates post-tax results and exclude the fair value charge for share awards.
EBITDA, for covenant test purposes, is based on the previous rolling twelve month period, measured twice yearly at 30 June and 31 December.
The covenants are monitored on a monthly basis and all external covenant requirements were met during the year.
Both key bank covenant metrics at year end were well covered.
Return on average capital employed is a KPI management uses to assess business unit performance.
The Group return on capital employed has fallen from 15% during 2011 to 14% in 2012 primarily due to the higher level of capital employed following the acquisition programme.
Changes in equity arise from the retention of earnings and, from time to time, issues of share capital.
The Board considers each ordinary dividend proposed based on the merits of the information available to it at the time.
Consideration is given to the financial projections of business performance and capital investment needs, together with feedback from shareholder discussions.
Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 103 36.
Capital Risk Management continued The Group operates a centralised treasury function with policies and procedures approved by the Board.
These cover funding, banking relationships, foreign currency, interest rate exposures, cash management and the investment of surplus cash.
Further detail on financial risks is provided within note 30.
The Group has significant foreign operations and hence results originate in a number of currencies, particularly in US dollars.
As a result, the Groups financial statements, which are reported in sterling, are subject to the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to currency conversions.
Currency options are used to reduce currency risk movements on the Groups results, by hedging approximately 50% of each years budgeted US dollar earnings into sterling.
Currency exposure on the balance sheet is, where practical, reduced by financing assets with borrowings in the same currency.
Spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to cover the net exposure of purchases and sales in non-domestic currencies.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 April 2013 and has not been provided for in these financial statements.
Share-based Payments Group and Company a Executive Share Options The Company used to operate an executive share option scheme, which granted options to eligible employees.
Under this scheme, the final granting of options occurred on 4 March 2008 and the subsequent final vesting of options ocurred on 4 March 2011.
Vesting of options was subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year period.
Thereafter the employee, subject to continued employment, has seven years in which to exercise the option.
Options were valued using an option pricing model based on the binomial model, but adjusted for the particular features of the options.
The assumptions used in calculating the charge to the income statement, which only related to options granted after November 2002 as permitted by IFRS 2, were as follows: Date of grant 04.03.2008 Exercise price p 784.5 Share price at grant p 784.5 Expected volatility % pa 32 Dividend yield % pa 1.1 Risk-free interest rate % pa 4.3 Turnover rates % pa 5 Fair value at grant p 294.9 The expected volatility was calculated as the historic volatility of the Hunting PLC share return over the five years prior to each grantdate.
The charge to the income statement attributable to Executive Share Options is nil 2011 0.2m, recognised as part of operating expenses.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise was 904.0p 2011 755.0p.
Under the PSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to executive Directors and senior employees.
Awards and options are subject to performance conditions and continued employment during the vesting period.
The PSP is a share award scheme and as such there is no exercise price.
The PSP awards made in the year will vest subject to total shareholder return TSR performance over a three year period from the date of grant, relative to comparator companies from the Dow Jones US Oil Equipment and Services sector index and the DJ STOXX TM Oil Equipment and Services sector index.
Details of the PSP awards and options movements during the year are set out below: 2012 2011 Number Number of awards of awards Outstanding at beginning of the year 635,571 450,112 Granted during the year 309,924 249,323 Lapsed during the year 233,439 63,864 Outstanding at the end of the year 712,056 635,571 Details of PSP awards and options outstanding at 31 December 2012 are as follows: Number Number of shares of shares Normal 2012 2011 vesting date Date of grant: 29 April 2009 155,541 28.04.12 26 February 2010 248,453 264,717 26.02.13 25 February 2011 202,214 215,313 25.02.14 17 April 2012 261,389 17.04.15 Outstanding at the end of the year 712,056 635,571 Company Overview Business Review Governance Financial Statements Other Information Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 105 38.
Share-based Payments continued The fair value of the PSP awards and options granted in 2012 was calculated using the Stochastic pricing model also known as the Monte Carlo model, which incorporates the effect of the TSR performance condition.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price at grant 906.0p 774.5p Expected volatility Hunting PLC 35.3% 50.7% Expected volatility Comparator group average 44.2% 71.4% Risk free rate 0.5% 1.9% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 604.97p 525.89p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years prior to grant, equal in length to the performance period at the date of grant.
The expected volatilities of each constituent of the comparator group are calculated on the same basis and input into the model individually and the average of these figures is shown in the table above.
The expected life of the award has been calculated as three years, commensurate with the vesting period.
The risk free rate is based on the UK gilt rate commensurate with the vesting period prevailing at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares that make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the achievement of the performance condition.
This is factored into the fair value calculation and as a result the dividend yield assumption is set to zero.
The initial accounting charge of the PSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.
The estimate of the expected forfeiture rate is 2.5% per annum.
The subsequent accounting charge for 2012 includes an adjustment to the initial accounting charge to allow for actual lapses rather than estimated lapses.
The charge to the income statement attributable to the PSP is 1.0m 2011 0.8m, which is recognised in operating expenses.
c Restricted Share Plan RSP The Company continues to operate and grant share awards and options under its restricted share plan.
Under the RSP, annual conditional awards of shares and options may be made to employees subject to continued employment during the vesting period.
There are no performance conditions attached to these awards and options.
The RSP is a share award scheme and as such there is no exercise price.

Share-based Payments continued The fair value of the RSP award granted in 2012 was calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price at grant 906.0p 774.5p Expected volatility 35.3% 50.7% Risk free rate 0.5% 1.9% Expected life 3 years 3 years Fair value 906.0p 774.5p The expected volatility was calculated using historic weekly volatility over three years to grant, equal in length to the remaining portion of the performance period at the date of grant.
Participants are entitled to a dividend equivalent over the number of shares which make up their award.
It is accumulated over the vesting period and released subject to the employee remaining in employment.
The initial accounting charge of the RSP incorporates an estimate of the number of shares that are expected to lapse for those participants who cease employment during the vesting period.

Principal Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies are described below.
1 Consolidation The Group accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiaries, together with its share of associates.
Uniform accounting policies have been adopted across the Group.
2 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies irrespective of the percentage of voting rights owned.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and are fide-consolidated from the date control ceases.
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.
Consequently the consideration is determined as the fair value of the net assets transferred to the vendor and includes an estimate of any contingent consideration.
The net assets acquired are also measured at their respective fair values for initial recognition purposes on the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
3 Discontinued Operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Group that has either been disposed of or that is classified as held-for-sale, which represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.
Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and are shown net of tax.
4 Revenue Revenue is measured as the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods or services in the ordinary course of business, taking into account trade discounts and volume rebates, and is stated net of sales taxes.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, which is normally on delivery of the products.
Revenue from the sale of services is recognised when the services are rendered.
Revenue from the rental of plant and equipment is recognised as the income is earned.
5 Exceptional Items Exceptional items are regarded as items of income and expense, which should be separately disclosed by virtue of their significant size, incidence or nature to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Exceptional items principally comprise profits or losses on the disposal of subsidiaries, the impairment of assets, dry hole costs, movements on provisions for warranties on the disposal of subsidiaries, refund from Canadian tax authorities, retention bonuses for management of acquired businesses, acquisition costs, unamortised loan facility fees written off on early termination of the facility, the charge to the income statement for the value uplift to inventories, provisions for onerous leases and the release of contingent consideration liabilities recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries.
6 Interest Interest income and expense is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
7 Foreign Currencies a Individual Subsidiaries and Associates Accounts The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and associates are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
Transactions denoted in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities, except borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge, denoted in non-functional currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Borrowings designated as a hedging instrument in a net investment hedge are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date and exchange differences are taken direct to equity.
b Group Consolidated Accounts The presentation currency of the Group is sterling.
The net assets of non-sterling denominated subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences are recognised directly in equity in the foreign currency translation reserve, together with exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans used to finance foreign currency net investments.
The foreign currency translation reserve commenced on 1 January 2004.
Amounts arising prior to that date were re-set tozero.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Hunting PLC Annual Report 2012 112 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 45.
Principal Accounting Policies continued 8 Taxation The taxation charge in the income statement comprises current tax and deferred tax arising on the current years profit before tax and adjustments to tax arising on prior years profits.
Current tax is the expected tax payable arising in the current year on the current years profit before tax, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, plus adjustments to tax payable in respect of prior years profits.
Deferred tax is the expected tax payable on the current years profit before tax arising in a future year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised separately on the balance sheet and are reported as non-current assets in line with IAS 1.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that they are expected to be recoverable.
Deferred taxation on unremitted overseas earnings is provided for to the extent a tax charge is foreseeable.
If items of income and expense are recognised in other comprehensive income, then the current and deferred tax relating to those items is also recognised in other comprehensive income.
9 Segmental Reporting Financial information on operating segments that corresponds with information regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker is disclosed in the accounts.
Operating segments are components of the Group that are engaged in providing related products.
Geographical information is based on the location of where the sale originated and where the non-current assets are located.
10 Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation a General Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition and installation of the asset.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their residual value, over their estimated useful lives.
Land, pre-production oil and gas exploration costs and assets under construction are not depreciated.
With the exception of oil and gas exploration and production equipment see 10 b below, assets are depreciated using the straight-line method at the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 10% Leasehold buildings life of lease 1 Plant, machinery and motor vehicles 6% to 33 3% The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any impairment in value and are included in the relevant asset category.
Depreciation of these assets commences when they are ready for their intended use.
In the case of a new manufacturing facility, it is when the facility has been commissioned.
For larger facilities, this may occur in phases.
Computer software integral to an item of machinery is capitalised as part of the hardware.
b Exploration Expenditure Oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised pending determination of the existence of commercial reserves and are included in the asset category oil and gas exploration and development.
Upon determination that commercially viable quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the costs are charged immediately to the income statement.
Depreciation of oil and gas expenditure commences when production commences.
The costs are depreciated using the unit of production method.
11 Goodwill Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration paid for a business exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to the cashgenerating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business that remains on the balance sheet at the date of disposal is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.

Principal Accounting Policies continued 12 Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses where applicable.
These assets have a finite life and are amortised in accordance with the pattern of expected future economic benefits, orwhenthis cannot be reliably estimated, by using the straight-line method.
Intangible assets are amortised over the following periods: Customer relationships eight to ten years Patents ten to twelve years Unpatented technology ten years Trademarks and domain names one to five years 13 Impairments The Group performs goodwill impairment reviews at least annually.
The Group also assesses at least annually whether there have been any events or changes in circumstances that indicate that property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill may be impaired.
An impairment review is carried out whenever the assessment indicates that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
For the purposes of impairment testing, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows.
Where impairment exists, the asset is written down to the higher of a its fair value minus costs to sell: and b its value in use.
Impairments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
An impairment to goodwill is never reversed.
When applicable, an impairment of any other asset is reversed, but only to the extent that the consequent carrying value does not exceed what would have been the carrying value had the impairment not originally been made.
14 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in-first-out method and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs of disposal in the ordinary course of business.
The cost of inventories includes direct costs plus production overheads.
15 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash.
Accrued interest is disclosed as part of the year-end balance.
For cash flow statement purposes, cash and cash equivalents include bank overdrafts and short-term deposits with a maturity of less than three months from the date of deposit.
In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
16 Financial Assets The Group classifies its financial assets principally into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and reevaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration paid, plus, in the case of financial assets that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset is impaired and if necessary the carrying amount is reduced to the appropriate value.
The loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Financial assets cease to be recognised when the right to receive cash flows has expired or the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
17 Loans and Receivables The Groups financial assets are principally loans and receivables, which comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
Loans and receivables are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets, otherwise they are presented as non-current assets.
By virtue of the nature of the effective interest method, interest arising on loans carried at amortised cost is regarded as an integral part of the loan balance and is therefore included within the carrying amount of the loan.
Consequently, interest receivable within twelve months on loans due after more than one year is recognised within non-current assets.

Principal Accounting Policies continued 18 Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value at the trade date which is normally the consideration received less, in the case of financial liabilities that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs.
The Group subsequently re-measures all of its non-derivative financial liabilities, including trade payables, at amortised cost.
Payables are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year, otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.
By virtue of the nature of the effective interest method, interest arising on loans that are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method is regarded as an integral part of the loan balance and is therefore included within the carrying amount of the loan.
Consequently, interest payable within twelve months on loans due after more than one year is recognised in non-current borrowings.
19 Debt Issue Costs When it is probable that some or all of a loan facility will be drawn down, transaction costs are capitalised and presented as a reduction to the borrowed amount and subsequently amortised through interest expense using an appropriate effective interest method.
When it is not probable that some or all of the loan facility will be drawn down, the facility fee is capitalised as a prepayment for services and amortised over the period of the relevant facility on a straight-line basis.
The amortisation charge is recognised in the income statement as an interest expense.
20 Leases An operating lease is defined as a lease that is not a finance lease.
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
The rental costs incurred on operating leases are charged to the income statement as incurred over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis.
Operating lease income is recognised in the income statement within other income as it is earned.
21 Provisions Provisions are liabilities for which the amount or timing of future expenditure is uncertain.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation.
Whenever the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted to their present value.
22 Post-employment Benefits a Defined Contribution Retirement Schemes Payments to defined contribution retirement schemes are charged to the income statement when they fall due.
b Defined Benefit Retirement Schemes Payments to defined benefit retirement schemes are recognised as increments to the assets of the schemes.
The amount charged to the income statement with respect to these schemes, within profit from operations, is the increase in the retirement benefit obligation resulting from the additional service provided by the participating employees during the current year, which is measured using the Projected Unit method.
Interest arising on the obligations and the expected return from the assets are also recognised in the income statement, net, within net finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised fully and immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
23 Share-based Payments The Group issues share-based payments LTIP awards, which can be settled in either cash or equity, to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
A liability is recognised equal to the current fair value of the services received, determined at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of the liability is remeasured at each subsequent reporting date and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The fair value is measured as the present value of the expected future cash flows.
The Group also issues equity-settled share-based payments PSP and RSP awards to certain employees as consideration for services received from the employees.
The fair value of the employees services is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of awards that will ultimately vest.
The fair value of employees services is determined by an external valuer, using the Monte Carlo model for PSP awards and the Black-Scholes model for the RSP awards, with reference to the grant date fair value of the options granted.
The fair value includes market performance conditions in respect of the performance based awards and excludes the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date and at the vesting date, where the estimate is adjusted to reflect current expectations.
The adjustment is included as part of the underlying expense recognised in the income statement.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date.
