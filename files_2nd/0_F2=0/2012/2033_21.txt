The tax effect of exceptional items in the current year amounted to a tax credit of 0.2 million 2011: 2.2 million.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 22% by 2014.
A reduction in the rate from 26% to 25% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, and a further reduction to 24% effective from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax liability at 30 April 2012 has been calculated based on the rate of 24% substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Companys deferred tax liability accordingly.
Adjustments in respect of prior periods primarily result from a reassessment of tax liabilities relating to an overseas subsidiary.

Impairment testing There has been no impairment charge for the year 2011: nil.
In order to determine whether impairments are required the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future pre-tax cash ows over a five year period and uses a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity model, which reects the expected long-term average growth rate for the business in which the CGU operates.
The budgets for the next financial year form the basis of the cash ow projections for each CGU.
Cash ow projections for the next four financial years reect managements conservative expectations of the medium term operating performance of the CGUs and growth prospects in each CGUs markets and regions, and have been modelled in line with historic patterns experienced by the Group in recent years.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount, unless the fair value less costs to sell the respective CGU is an amount in excess of the value in use.
The calculation of value in use for goodwill is sensitive to the following key assumptions: i Operating cash ow One of the key drivers of operating cash ow is revenue.
The 2013 revenue gures for each CGU are based on the budget for the next financial year.
For the years 2014 to 2017, the likely organic growth rates were assessed for each region in the CGU, taking account of past experience and historic player patterns.
For all CGUs, the terminal growth rate used was 2.0% 2011: 2.0%.
In all cases management consider the assumed growth rates to be conservative.
ii Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre-tax rate that reects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specic to the CGU.
For the Sports, Games and Poker CGUs, a pre-tax discount rate of 12.2% 2011: 12.2% has been used in discounting the projected cash ows for each CGU.
discount rate from the prior year reects changes to the relevant market rates in the US economy.
In addition, the discount rate differs from the Sports, The calculation of recoverable amount is sensitive to forecast future earnings and the discount rates applied.
Management have considered the effect of either a decrease of up to 10.0% in future planned earnings for all financial years ending 30 April 2017 or an increase in the discount rate for each CGU of up to 2.0%, both of which are considered unlikely.
There are no reasonable changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying the calculation of the recoverable amount is considered to be slightly more sensitive to a decrease in future earnings assumptions as well as future developments in US horseracing.
In view of this and on the basis of reasonable assumptions used in the impairment review, the Directors consider that there is no Betfair Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 80 2012 Overview Pages 01 09 Business Review Pages 10 37 Governance Pages 38 57 Financial Statements Pages 58 100 12 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities The Group and Company have the following principal investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities: Ordinary Country of shares incorporation Principal activity Classication held % The Sporting Exchange Limited England Holding company Subsidiary 100 Betfair Limited England Support services Subsidiary 100 Betfair General Betting Limited England Bookmaking Subsidiary 100 Portway Press Limited England Horse racing data Subsidiary 100 Timeform Betfair Racing Club Limited England Horse racing club Subsidiary 100 TSE Global Limited England Trading Subsidiary 100 TSE Development Limited England Intellectual property licensor Subsidiary 100 TSE Holdings Limited England Holding company Subsidiary 100 Winslow One Limited England Holding company Subsidiary 100 Winslow Two England Holding company Subsidiary 100 Winslow Three Limited Cayman Islands Support services Subsidiary 100 Winslow Four Cayman Islands Support services Subsidiary 100 TSE Gibraltar LP Gibraltar Bookmaking Subsidiary 100 TSE Data Processing Limited Ireland Data Centre Subsidiary 100 Polco Limited Malta Intellectual property licensor Subsidiary 100 Betfair Games Limited Malta Online gaming Subsidiary 100 Betfair Casino Limited Malta Online gaming Subsidiary 100 Betfair Counterparty Services Limited Malta Online gaming Subsidiary 100 Betfair Entertainment Limited Malta Online gaming Subsidiary 100 Betfair International Plc.

Trade and other payables The fair value of trade and other payables is estimated as the present value of future cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the balance sheet date if the effect is material.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments comprise Sports betting open positions.
The fair value of open Sports bets at the year end has been calculated using the latest available prices on the Companys own markets on relevant sporting events.

Financial risk management The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Risk management policies and procedures are reviewed regularly and monitored to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations surrounding risk management.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group also spreads its cash reserves across several highly rated banks and investments to mitigate counterparty risks.
The Group performs regular cash ow projections to ensure that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of at least 90 days.
The Group has no committed lines of credit.
The Groups financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments and excluding the effect of netting agreements summarised in the table below all have contractual maturities of one year or less as at 30 April.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The management of market risk is performed by the Group under the supervision of the Corporate Risk Committee and according to the guidelines approved by them.
The Group will utilise hedges where there is an identied requirement to manage profit or loss volatility.
Sports betting open positions There are several products which expose the Group to open betting positions resulting in net gains or losses in the income statement.
Amounts received from customers on sportsbook events that have not occurred by the year end are derivative financial instruments and have been designated by the Group on initial recognition as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss.
The carrying amount of the liability is not signicantly different from the amount that the Group is expected to pay out at maturity of the financial instruments.
Sports bets are non-interest bearing.
There is no interest rate or credit risk associated with open Sports bets.
A currency risk may arise where such bets are denominated in a currency other than the sterling.
This currency risk is not considered significant as any payout on such bets is made in the same currency as that in which the bet was originally staked.
Market risk Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than Sterling GBP.
The currencies in which these transactions primarily are denominated in are US dollars USD, Euros EUR and Australian dollar AUD.

However, the Group monitors all foreign currency exposures and where appropriate, will take out a foreign currency hedge to mitigate the risk of unfavourable foreign exchange movements on specic commitments the Group enters into.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows.
This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments except derivatives when it is based on notional amounts: 30 April 2012 GBP EUR USD AUD Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 97,975 16,383 18,067 1,974 1,009 135,408 Trade payables 9,840 5,485 192 81 15,598 Balance sheet exposure 88,135 10,898 17,875 1,974 928 119,810 30 April 2011 GBP EUR USD AUD Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 139,831 6,680 7,363 870 294 155,038 Trade payables 3,445 1,544 200 21 5,210 Balance sheet exposure 136,386 5,136 7,163 870 273 149,828 A 15.0% weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at 30 April would have increased decreased equity and income statement by the amounts shown below.
This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.
Equity Income statement 2012 2011 2012 2011 000 000 000 000 Foreign Currency EUR 968 272 2,891 1,179 USD 34 35 3,188 1,299 AUD 348 154 A 15.0% strengthening of the above currencies against sterling at 30 April would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has no bank loans and therefore is not exposed to interest rate risk on its liabilities.
All other debt is repayable to related parties.
At the balance sheet date the Groups interest-bearing financial assets were as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Variable rate instruments Financial assets cash and cash equivalents 135,408 155,038 Sensitivity analysis An increase of 200 and a decrease of 200 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would have increased decreased equity and profit by the amounts shown below.
The rationale behind the 2.0% sensitivity analysis is that interest rates in the UK have been low due to the economic climate and any increase or decrease greater than 2.0% is unlikely to occur.
