The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and past employee behaviour.
