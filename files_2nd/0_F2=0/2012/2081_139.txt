6 Estimated value range of equity awards The current face value of STI and LTI awards allocated during FY2012 and yet to vest to be disclosed under the Australian Corporations Act 2001 is the number of awards as set out in the previous tables multiplied by the current share price of BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc as applicable.
The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on, and therefore fluctuates with, the share prices of BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc at the date that any particular award is exercised.
The table below provides five-year share price history for BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc, and history of dividends paid.
