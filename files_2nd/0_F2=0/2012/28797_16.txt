The facility was drawn in full on 6 January 2011.

As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2013 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been calculated by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
In respect of segregated accounts where performance criteria have been exceeded at the end of the period, the value of the associated performance fee payable to the manager has been provided for under current liabilities.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 0.1 million as at 31 December 2012 31 March 2012: 0.1 million.

The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 20% 31 March 2012: 20%, dividends of 28.0p 31 March 2012: 4.0p per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate based on the Sterling Benchmark Swap Curve.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-Term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 23.
To allow for the effects of early exercise and staff turnover, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised four and a half years after the relevant grant dates.
Weighted average exercise prices are calculated as the sum of all prices of SAR exercises divided by number of SARs exercised.

The assets and liabilities include the following financial instruments: investments including equity and non-equity shares, partnership interests and fixed income securities which are held in accordance with the Groups investment objectives.
The investments are designated at fair value through profit or loss FVPL : cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups investment activities: long-term borrowings used to enhance returns: and derivative transactions undertaken by the Group in accordance with the Groups investment objectives, and to manage market risks and currency risks.

In relation to receivables, payables and short-term borrowings the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The fair value of the loans was estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
As at 31 December 2012 this amounted to 147.8 million 31 March 2012: 250.1 million.
No financial assets or liabilities were reclassified during the period or prior year by the Group or the Company.
28.2 Financial risk management The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The identification, mitigation and monitoring of these risks is undertaken by JRCMs executive management under the authority of the Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, and is described in more detail below.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing risks have not changed since the previous accounting period.
The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole and it is at the Group level that the majority of the risk management procedures are performed.
Where relevant and materially different to the Group position, Company specific risk exposures are explained alongside those of the Group.

Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices.
Market risk can be summarised as comprising three types of risk: Price risk The risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk Interest rate risk The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates Currency risk The risk that fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates The Groups exposure, sensitivity to and management of each of these risks is described in further detail below.
Management of market risk Management of market risk is fundamental to the Groups investment objective.
The investment portfolio is continually monitored to ensure an appropriate balance of risk and reward.
From time to time, the Group may seek to reduce or increase its exposure to stock markets and currencies by taking positions in currency forward contracts, index futures and options relating to one or more stock markets.
These instruments are used for the purpose of hedging some or all of the existing exposure within the Groups investment portfolio to those currencies or particular markets or to enable increased exposure when deemed appropriate.
Price risk Price risk other than caused by interest rate or currency risk may affect the value of the quoted and the unquoted investments held by the Group.
Management of price risk The Group has a widely diversified investment portfolio which significantly reduces the exposure to individual asset price risk.
The performance of third party investment managers is regularly reviewed and assessed to ensure compliance with their mandates and that their performance is compatible with the Groups investment objective.
Exposure to price risk The Groups exposure to price risk can be assumed to be equivalent to the investment portfolio, excluding interests in debt securities and including relevant derivatives, as set out below: 31 December 31 March 2012 2012 million million Exposure to price risk 1,875.8 1,959.4 RIT Capital Partners plc Report and Accounts December 2012 61 226323 RIT R&A pp42-pp79 06 03 2013 12:23 Page 62 Notes to the Financial Statements 28.
Financial Instruments continued As at the period end, the Groups exposure to listed equities after adjusting for index futures and unquoted investments represented 101.5% of net assets 31 March 2012: 102.1%.
Price risk sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS with regards to changes in market prices is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% increase in the fair value of the investments with all other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis takes account of the relevant derivative transactions the Group has entered into including those to provide a hedge against such movements.
31 December 31 March 2012 2012 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 187.6 195.9 c. Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly through its share capital and retained profits, including realised gains on investments.
In addition, financing has been obtained through bank borrowings.
Changes in interest rates have a direct impact on the fair value or future cash flows of the following financial assets and liabilities: Gilts and other government securities Money market funds Credit funds Cash and cash equivalents Group borrowings Certain derivative contracts Changes in interest rates indirectly affect the fair value of the Groups other investments including those in quoted and unquoted equity securities.
Management of interest rate risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making decisions on investments and borrowings.
The Company uses interest rate swaps as a hedge of future interest payments and this has the effect of increasing the proportion of its fixed interest debt.
Exposure to interest rate risk The Groups exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are reset and fixed interest rates giving fair value risk, is shown below.

These provide indirect exposure to interest rate risk.

Portfolio investments include direct and indirect via external managed funds investments in government securities, money markets, and unquoted debt securities issued by portfolio companies.
Interest received on cash and cash equivalents is at prevailing market rates.
The Group has total borrowings of 147.8 million outstanding at the period end 31 March 2012: 250.1 million.
The credit facility comprising this total incurs fixed interest payments through the operation of interest rate swaps.
Further details are provided in note 18.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis The approximate sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS in regard to changes in interest rates is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 200 basis point annualised increase in prevailing interest rates at the balance sheet date applied to the floating rate assets and liabilities and the following assumptions: the fair values of assets and liabilities are not affected by a change in interest rates funds will be reinvested in similar interest bearing securities on maturity all other variables are held constant The Group has direct exposure to the effect of interest rate changes on the valuation and cash flows of its interest bearing assets and liabilities.
However, it may also be indirectly affected by the impact of interest rate changes on the earnings of certain companies in which the Group invests, and the impact on valuations that use interest rates as an input, such as valuation models for unquoted investments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis may not reflect the full effect on the Groups net assets.
A 200 basis point decrease is assumed to produce an equal and opposite impact.
31 December 31 March 2012 2012 Impact on IS Impact on IS & net assets & net assets million million Total 1.8 2.1 d. Currency risk Consistent with its investment objective, the Group invests in financial instruments and transactions denominated in currencies other than Sterling.
As such, the Groups profits and net assets could be significantly affected by currency movements.
Management of currency risk The Group enters into forward currency contracts as a means of limiting or increasing its exposure to particular currencies.
These contracts are used for the purpose of hedging the existing currency exposure of elements of the Groups portfolio as a means of reducing risk or to enable increased exposure when this is deemed appropriate.
Part of the Companys currency exposure in respect of its US Dollar investments is also hedged by way of the Companys borrowings denominated in this currency.

Financial Instruments continued Currency Risk Sensitivity Analysis The sensitivity of the Groups net assets and income statement IS in regard to changes in key currencies is illustrated below.
This is based on an assumed 10% strengthening of Sterling relative to the foreign currencies as at 31 December, and assumes all other variables are held constant.
A 10% weakening is assumed to produce an equal and opposite effect.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the net foreign currency assets held at the balance sheet dates and takes account of forward foreign exchange contracts that offset the effects of changes in currency exchange rates.

Credit risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument held by the Group will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Group which could result in a loss to the Group.
Management of credit risk This risk is not considered significant and is managed as follows: The vast majority of the Groups transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis Use of a large number of brokers Liquid investments cash and cash equivalents are divided between a number of different financial institutions The majority of the portfolio investments exposed to credit risk relate to highly rated government securities A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if a counterparty was unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.

Financial Instruments continued f. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will have difficulty in meeting its obligations in respect of financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group has significant investments in and commitments to unquoted companies and unquoted funds which are inherently illiquid.
In addition the Group holds investments with other third party organisations which may require notice periods in order to be realised.
Management of liquidity risk The Group manages its liquid resources to ensure sufficient cash is available to meet all of its contractual commitments.
It monitors the level of short-term funding and balances the need for access to short-term funding with the long-term funding needs of the Group.
Exposure to liquidity risk Liquidity risk is not viewed as significant as a substantial proportion of the Groups net assets are in liquid or readily realisable assets, which could be utilised to meet funding requirements if necessary.
The Company has the power, under its Articles of Association, to take out both short and long-term borrowings.
The Group has a credit facility totalling US Dollar 400 million details of which are disclosed in note 18.
The remaining contractual maturities of the Groups financial liabilities at the period end, based on the earliest date on which payment could be required are as follows: 31 December 2012 31 March 2012 3 months 3-12 3 months 3-12 or less months 1 year Total or less months 1 year Total million million million million million million million million Current liabilities: Bank loan overdraft 147.8 147.8 250.1 250.1 Derivatives 16.8 3.4 20.2 13.8 13.8 Other liabilities 11.8 11.8 12.9 12.9 Non-current liabilities: Derivatives 4.7 4.7 Total 176.4 3.4 179.8 276.8 4.7 281.5 Commitments 153.9 153.9 137.7 137.7 Total 330.3 3.4 333.7 414.5 4.7 419.2 28.3 Collateral Collateral is posted by the Group in relation to derivative transactions.

The notional amount of certain types of financial instruments provides a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the balance sheet but does not necessarily indicate the amount of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the derivatives.
The derivative instruments become favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, security prices or foreign exchange rates relative to the terms of the derivative instrument.
The aggregate contractual or notional amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities can fluctuate significantly from time to time.

These are as follows: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data i. e. unobservable inputs level 3 The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Group.
The Group considers observable data to be market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
Where adjustments have been required to quoted prices to arrive at fair value, or where a market price is available but the market is not considered active, the Group has classified these investments as level 2.
The Group considers all unquoted direct investments and unquoted funds as described on page 8 of the Investment Review as level 3 assets, as the valuations of these assets are not based on observable market data.
Where funds within the absolute return & credit and real asset categories invest into illiquid stocks, these are also considered by the Group to be level 3 assets.

Pension Commitments JRCM has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme consists of a defined benefit section which is closed to new members.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Under IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of the Schemes assets as reduced by the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
It is estimated that the contributions payable to the Scheme during the year ending 31 December 2013, will be 1.1 million as compared to 0.8 million paid during the period ended 31 December 2012.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of the assets held.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary, this resulted in an increase of contributions payable of 0.3 million.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following tables: At At 31 December 31 March 2012 2012 Discount rate 4.55% 5.15% Rate of increase in salaries 2.50% 3.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued before 5 April 1997 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase in payment of pensions accrued after 6 April 1997 4.25% 4.30% Inflation assumption Retail Price Index 2.95% 3.20% The mortality assumptions employed as at 31 December 2012 for active and deferred members are based on the pre-retirement mortality assumptions of AM FC00.
Post retirement assumptions for active members, deferred members and pensioners are based on the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS light series year of birth table and includes allowance for future improvements in life expectancy in line with the Actuarial Professions Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI projections with a long-term trend of 1.5% per annum long-term trend.
It is assumed that 80% of members are married as at the date of death 31 March 2012: 80%.
The fair value of the assets held by the defined benefit scheme, the long-term expected rate of return on each class of assets and the value of the Schemes liabilities assessed on the assumptions described above are shown in the following table: Long-term Long-term rate of return Value at rate of return Value at expected at 31 December expected at 31 March 31 December 2012 31 March 2012 2012 million 2012 million Equities 8.00% 10.5 8.00% 9.6 Alternative investments 5.00% 1.3 6.00% 1.6 Corporate bonds 4.00% 2.5 4.00% 1.9 Cash 2.00% 0.2 2.00% 0.1 Fair value of the Schemes assets 14.5 13.2 Present value of the Schemes liabilities 16.4 14.5 Surplus deficit in the Scheme 1.9 1.3 The deficit of the Scheme at 31 December 2012 was 1.9 million 31 March 2012: deficit 1.3 million.
The Scheme does not invest in the Companys ordinary shares 31 March 2012: nil or in any property occupied by the Group, or any other assets used by the Group 31 March 2012: nil.
