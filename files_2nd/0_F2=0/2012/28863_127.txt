In carrying out this policy, the Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the FSA.
The FSA uses risk asset ratio RAR as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks : by international agreement, the RAR should be not less than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%.
The Group has complied with the FSAs capital requirements throughout the year.
A number of subsidiaries and sub-groups within the Group, principally banking and insurance entities, are subject to various individual regulatory capital requirements in the UK and overseas.
