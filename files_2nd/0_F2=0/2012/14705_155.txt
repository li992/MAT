91 The administrator of KSF appealed the decision and on 2 March 2011 the Company entered into a settlement deed with the administrator.
As part of the settlement deed the Company received 5.6m in full and final settlement of the amount held in escrow and the remaining claim in the administration.
In effect the shortfall between the value of the debtors and the amount received is an increase in the consideration paid to acquire the shares on 21 February 2010.
In total the Group acquired 12.153m shares in Blacks with a market value of 6.6m.
The Group subsequently purchased a further 5.750m shares on 25 July 2011.
On 9 January 2012 JD Sports Fashion plc announced that it had acquired the trade and assets of Blacks from its administrators.
Existing shareholders did not receive any distribution from the administration and so the Group has written off the original cost of its investment in Blacks.
This resulted in a transfer of historic losses, previously recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, of 7.1m into the income statement in the year.
The financial assets at 29 April 2012 relate to a strategic investment held of 11.97% in share capital.
At 29 April 2012 the Group had no investments in excess of 20% of share capital.
