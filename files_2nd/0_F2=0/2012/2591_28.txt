Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements 1.
General information, statement of compliance and basis of preparation Bumi plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Companys registered address is 2nd Floor, 4 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7HJ.
The Companys registered number is 7460129.
Accounting policies The Company is the ultimate parent entity of the Group.
The Companys financial statements are included in Bumi plcs consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act, the Company has not presented its own income statement or statement of comprehensive income.
The Companys loss for the period was $2,432m 2011: loss at $573m restated.
The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee Interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the European Union.
They also comply with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The financial statements are presented in US dollars, rounded to the nearest million.
They are prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Company financial statements are, where relevant, the same as those set out in Note 2 to the Group Financial Statements with the addition of the following: Investments Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less impairment provisions.
Investments are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit on a value in use basis or at its fair value less costs to sell if higher.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital, with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant unit.
As highlighted in note 2 to the Group Financial Statements, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB March 2013 Board meeting discussed how the fair value of non-current assets should be determined.
This discussion clarified an area of interpretation within the existing standards and highlighted that for investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in stand-alone entity accounts and in particular that the fair value of cash generating units CGU, when those CGUs correspond to a quoted entity, should be the product of their quoted price multiplied by the number of shares held and not by reference to an assessment of fair value using discounted future cash flows.
Management has therefore changed its accounting policy in respect of the determination of fair value less cost to sell in stand-alone entity accounts.
The impact of this change in accounting policy is that the investment in Vallar Limited, which indirectly holds 85% of the share capital of PT Berau through Vallar Investments UK Limited VIUK is valued by reference to the quoted market price of PT Berau.
The carrying value of Vallar Limited as at 31 December 2011has been restated to reflect the impairment of its indirect holding of PT Berau, as result of the change in accounting policy because its recoverable amount is equal to the revised fair value less costs to sell.
