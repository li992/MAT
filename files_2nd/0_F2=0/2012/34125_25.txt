Following the year end the partners reduced the outstanding debt drawn to 60 million, through repaying and cancelling 2.7 million of the facility.
The Partnership loan has a loan to value covenant which requires the gross loan to the value of the Partnerships investment property assets to be no more than 55%.
The loan is non-recourse to the Group.
The Group has an option to acquire the assets within the Partnership or the remaining interest in the Partnership not held by the Group, which is first exercisable at 31 March 2013, but can be deferred to March 2014 and March 2015, subject to Internal Rate of Return IRR hurdles.
The price payable is based on the market value of the Partnerships assets and liabilities, and is subject to certain promotes, dependent on the IRR achieved.

The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Professional Standards, published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the Red Book.
The valuation of each of the investment properties and the investment properties under construction has been prepared on the basis of either Fair Value or Fair Value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential, as appropriate.
75 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2012 14.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book.
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W have confirmed that: The members of the RICS who have been the signatories to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation have done so since September 2004.
C&W have been carrying out this bi-annual valuation for the same purposes as this valuation on behalf of the Group since September 2004.
C&W do not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group.
In relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of the total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less than 5%.
The fee payable to C&W is a fixed amount per store, and is not contingent on the appraised value.
Market uncertainty C&Ws valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from the recent global banking crisis coupled with the economic downturn, which have caused a low number of transactions in the market for self storage property.
C&W note that, although there were a number of self storage transactions in 2007, the only significant transactions since 2007 are: 1.
The sale of a 51% share in Shurgard Europe which was announced in January 2008 and completed on 31 March 2008.
The sale of the former Keepsafe portfolio by Macquarie to Alligator Self Storage which was completed in January 2010: and 3.
The purchase by Shurgard Europe of the 80% interests held by its joint venture partner Arcapita in its two European joint venture vehicles, First Shurgard and Second Shurgard.
The price paid was 172 million Euros and the transaction was announced in March 2011.
The two joint ventures owned 72 self storage properties.
Four further smaller transactions took place in 2011 at West Molesey, Cambridge, Dartford and St Albans.
C&W state that due to the lack of comparable market information in the self storage sector, there is greater uncertainty attached to their opinion of value than would be anticipated during more active market conditions.
Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold and long leasehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% of the estimated annual revenue subject to a cap and a collar.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming straight-line absorption from day one actual occupancy to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 53 trading stores both freeholds and leaseholds open at 31 March 2012 averages 82.4% 31 March 2011: 83.1%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
The average time assumed for the 32 established stores to trade at their maturity levels is 32 months 31 March 2011: 36 months : for the 21 lease-up stores, the period to maturity is 44 months 31 March 2011: 49 months.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, yields for other trading property types such as student housing and hotels, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
The valuation included in the accounts assumes rental growth in future periods.
If an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the net initial yield pre administration expenses for the 32 established stores is 6.8% 31 March 2011: 6.3% rising to a stabilised net yield pre administration expenses of 8.1% 31 March 2011: 8.2%.
Also on a no growth and pre administration expenses basis the 21 lease-up stores have a net initial yield of 4.4% 31 March 2011: 3.6% rising to 8.6% 31 March 2011: 8.7% on stabilisation.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 11.23% 31 March 2011: 11.29%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.8% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.8% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Short leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leasehold properties is 16.7 years 31 March 2011: 16.2 years.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Assumptions continued Investment properties under construction C&W have valued the stores in development adopting the same methodology as set out above but on the basis of the cash flow projection expected for the store at opening and after allowing for the outstanding costs to take each scheme from its current state to completion and full fit-out.
C&W have allowed for holding costs and construction contingency, as appropriate.
One scheme does not yet have planning consent and C&W have reflected the planning risk in their valuation.
Proposed VAT change The Government has announced in the Budget Statement a proposed change to the VAT status of self storage from 1 October 2012.
The rental of self storage units is currently exempt from VAT as a licence to occupy land in the same way as the rental of commercial property.
The Government are proposing that self storage will be subject to standard rate VAT 20%.
C&W have prepared their valuation reflecting the potential impact of the proposed VAT Change.
We also instructed C&W to prepare a valuation on the Special Assumption that the proposed VAT change is not reflected in the valuation.
Immature stores: value uncertainty C&W have assessed the value of each property individually.
However, four of the stores in the portfolio are relatively immature and have low initial cash flow.
C&W have endeavoured to reflect the nature of the cash flow profile for these properties in their valuation, and the higher associated risks relating to the as yet unproven future cash flow, by adjustment to the capitalisation rates and discount rates adopted.
However, immature low cash flow stores of this nature are rarely, if ever, traded individually in the market, unless as part of a distressed sale or similar situation.
Although, there is more evidence of immature low cash flow stores being traded as part of a group or portfolio transaction.
Please note C&Ws comments in relation to market uncertainty in the self storage sector due to the lack of comparable market transactions and information.
The degree of uncertainty relating to the four immature stores is greater than in relation to the balance of the properties due to there being even less market evidence that might be available for more mature properties and portfolios.
C&W state that in practice, if an actual sale of the properties were to be contemplated then any immature low cash flow stores would normally be presented to the market for sale lotted or grouped with other more mature assets owned by the same entity, in order to alleviate the issue of negative or low short term cash flow.
This approach would enhance the marketability of the group of assets and assist in achieving the best price available in the market by diluting the cash flow risk.
C&W have not adjusted their opinion of Fair Value to reflect such a grouping of the immature assets with other properties in the portfolio and all stores have been valued individually.
However, they highlight the matter to alert the Group to the manner in which the properties might be grouped or lotted in order maximise their attractiveness to the market place.
C&W consider this approach to be a valuation assumption but not a Special Assumption, the latter being an assumption that assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date and which, if not adopted, could produce a material difference in value.
C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the Entity would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly either higher or lower from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting the lotting assumption described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.8% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
The Group therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2012 of 794,169,000 33,874,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements.
The valuations in Big Yellow Limited Partnership are 4,920,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements, of which the Groups share is 1,640,000.
The sum of these is 35,514,000 and translates to 27.2 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 14.

The prior year gain of 71,000 was comprised of a write back of a prior year impairment on a site of 500,000, offset by a loss on disposal of 429,000.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 000 000 Trade receivables 1,559 1,776 Other receivables 1,316 274 Prepayments and accrued income 8,068 9,490 10,943 11,540 Trade receivables are net of a bad debt provision of 24,000 2011: 25,000.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers, requiring them to pay in advance of their storage period and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that these customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from 1 week to 4 weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 173,000 2011: 155,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables is 31 days past due 2011: 34 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2012 2011 000 000 1 30 days 117 99 30 60 days 16 33 60 days 40 23 Total 173 155 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2012 2011 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 25 29 Amounts provided in year 39 69 Amounts written off as uncollectible 40 73 Balance at the end of the year 24 25 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.

The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
Included within accruals and deferred income is 1,656,000 in respect of the Long Term Bonus Performance Plan.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups VAT payable under the capital goods scheme as follows: 2012 2011 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 000 000 000 000 VAT payable under the capital goods scheme 956 913 1,872 1,791 The fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at interest rates prevailing at the year end.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups banking facilities at the year end required hedging of 70% of the funds drawn under the investment tranche of its core banking facility.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
With the exception of derivative instruments which are classified as a financial liability at fair value through the profit and loss FVTPL, financial liabilities are categorised under amortised cost.
All financial assets are categorised as loans and receivables.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
79 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2012 18.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Debt 284,000 275,000 Cash and cash equivalents 10,060 8,954 Net debt 273,940 266,046 Balance sheet equity 494,500 544,949 Net debt to equity ratio 55.4% 48.8% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term bank borrowings, as detailed in note 19.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on its existing store portfolio, and in addition since the year end has arranged a 15 year loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited secured on a portfolio of 15 self storage assets.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
At 31 March 2012 the Group had two interest rate derivatives in place: 120 million fixed at 2.99% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2015 and 70 million fixed at 3.93% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument also until September 2015.
In April 2012, the Group announced the completion of a 100 million 15 year term fixed rate loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited, which was deployed to repay 100 million of existing bank debt.
At the same time, the Group also cancelled 100 million of the above interest rate derivatives at a cost of 9.2 million.
This left a 90 million interest rate swap in the core bank debt facility at 2.99% plus margin to September 2015, with the remaining 100 million of the core bank debt paying at floating rates plus margin, in addition to the Aviva fixed rate loan.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is one month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the statement of comprehensive income.
The loss in the statement of comprehensive income for the year of these interest rate swaps was 7,965,000 2011: gain of 197,000.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2012 was a liability of 15,748,000 2011: liability of 7,783,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2012, it is estimated that an increase of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 470,000 2011: reduced adjusted profit before tax by 425,000 and a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 470,000 2011: increased adjusted profit before tax by 425,000.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis continued The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the year, following the drawing of additional floating rate debt from cash resources.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 36,000 customers in our stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
H. Financial maturity analysis In respect of interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table provides a maturity analysis for individual elements.
Less than One to Two to More than Total one year two years five years five years 2012 Maturity 000 000 000 000 000 Debt Bank loan payable at variable rate 94,000 94,000 Debt fixed by interest rate derivatives 190,000 190,000 Total 284,000 284,000 Less than One to Two to More than Total one year two years five years five years 2011 Maturity 000 000 000 000 000 Debt Bank loan payable at variable rate 85,000 85,000 Debt fixed by interest rate derivatives 190,000 190,000 Total 275,000 275,000 I.
Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and short term deposits and those of other financial assets equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables at amortised cost are set out in note 16.
The amounts are presented net of provisions for doubtful receivables, and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Trade and other payables, including bank borrowings, are carried at amortised cost.
Finance lease liabilities are included at the fair value of their minimum lease payments.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps, as detailed in note 18J, have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7.

The Group has 41,000,000 in undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2012 which expire between one and two years 2011: 50,000,000 expiring between two and three years.
On 26 April 2012, the Group announced the completion of a 100 million 15 year fixed rate loan with Aviva Commercial Finance Limited.
The loan is secured over a portfolio of 15 freehold self storage centres which were valued at 242.1 million at 29 February 2012 for the purposes of the drawdown.
The annual fixed interest rate on the loan is 4.9%.
The loan amortises to 60 million over the course of the 15 years, consistent with the Group's medium term debt reduction strategy.
The debt service is payable monthly based on fixed annual amounts.
The loan outstanding on the fifth anniversary will be 89.8 million: 76.7 million outstanding on the tenth anniversary, with 60 million remaining at expiry in April 2027.
The new 15 year term loan has been deployed to repay and cancel 100 million of the Group's core bank debt facility, reducing it to 225 million of which 190 million is drawn.
This facility expires in September 2013 and is secured on the remainder of the Group's self storage centres.
The repayment and cancellation has been disproportionately applied against HSH Nordbank's commitment which has been reduced from 150 million to 65 million.
The remainder of the loan is held by Lloyds TBS Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc and Santander.
The Group was comfortably in compliance with its banking covenants at 31 March 2012, as illustrated in the table below.
At 31 March Covenant 2012 Minimum income cover on charged assets 1.5x 3.67x Minimum net assets excluding goodwill 250 million 493.1m Maximum gross loan to net assets gearing 1.3:1 0.58:1 The minimum net asset and gearing covenants on the Aviva loan are in line with the covenants on the existing loan.
There is also a minimum income cover covenant of 1.5x on the charged assets and a minimum debt service cover of 1.2x, and a loan to value covenant of 65% based on the valuation of the 15 assets charged to Aviva.
