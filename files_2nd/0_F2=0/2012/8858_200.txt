156 Johnson Matthey Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Accounts Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2012 27 Financial risk management continued 27a Foreign currency risk The group operates globally with a significant amount of its profit earned outside the UK.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the group has financed most of its investment in the USA and Europe by borrowing US dollars and euros respectively.
Although much of this funding is obtained by directly borrowing the relevant currency, a part is achieved through currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs.
To a lesser extent the group has also financed a portion of its investment in China, Japan and South Africa using currency borrowings and swaps.
The group has designated the currency swaps and two euro loans fair value of the loans was 202.0 million 2011 205.1 million as hedges of net investments in foreign operations as they hedge the changes in values of the subsidiaries net assets against movements in exchange rates.
These are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The majority of the cash flows are expected to occur and the hedge effect realised in the income statement in the year ending 31st March 2013.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar and a 5% 8.0 cent 2011 7.8 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 7.3 million 2011 4.6 million impact on operating profit.
The group is also exposed to the euro and a 5% 5.8 cent 2011 5.9 cent movement in the average exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 3.7 million 2011 3.0 million impact on operating profit.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.
For financial instruments the main exposures are to the US dollar and euro and are due to loans, swaps and cash flow hedges on forecast receipts and payments.
A 5% 8.0 cent 2011 8.0 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling would have had a 3.1 million 2011 4.4 million impact on operating profit and a 20.8 million 2011 23.9 million impact on equity for these instruments.
A 5% 6.0 cent 2011 5.7 cent movement in the closing exchange rate for the euro against sterling would have had a 5.7 million 2011 4.6 million impact on operating profit and a 21.4 million 2011 27.2 million impact on equity for these instruments.
However, the impact on operating profit relates primarily to the cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have occurred in the year and so would be offset by similar movements in the hedged items.
Similarly, the impact on equity relates primarily to foreign exchange positions used to hedge the subsidiaries net assets and so would be offset by an equal and opposite movement in the value of the relevant subsidiaries net assets.
The remaining impact on equity of 3.3 million 2011 3.2 million for the US dollar and 4.6 million 2011 5.7 million for the euro relates to cash flow hedging instruments hedging the forecast receipts and payments whose cash flows have yet to occur.
