4 The impairment of $979 million relates to the impairment of the legacy Man Multi-Manager business at 30 June 2012 of $142 million, and the impairments of the GLG business recognised at 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2012 of $91 million and $746 million respectively total of $837 million for GLG for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred is the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
From a capital management perspective all goodwill and acquired intangibles, net of deferred taxes, are supported with shareholders equity.
This approach is consistent with our regulatory capital treatment.
The acquisition of GLG was supported with existing excess shareholders capital and the issuance of new Man shares to the principals and key employees.
Investment management contracts IMCs IMCs are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows of the contracts and distribution channels acquired and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives which are between 9 to 12 years, and 10 years for the GLG and FRM brand names.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units The Group has three identified cash-generating units for impairment review purposes: GLG, FRM, and AHL.
The goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of FRM has been allocated to the FRM cash generating unit as the acquired FRM business has been fully integrated with the previous Man Multi-Manager business, which will benefit from all of the synergies from the acquisition.
In the prior period, the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of GLG was allocated to the cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
As at the date of acquisition, 77% of the acquired goodwill and all other intangible assets was allocated to the GLG CGU goodwill: $1,077 million: other intangibles $672 million with the remaining 23% of the goodwill allocated to the AHL CGU goodwill: $326 million.
78 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 Financial statements continued 12.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Ore Hill was previously reported as a separate cash-generating unit and is now part of the GLG cash-generating unit as it has been integrated into theGLG business.
The $22 million of goodwill relating to the Ore Hill business has been reclassified to the GLG CGU in the comparative period at 31December 2011 accordingly.
GLG cash generating unit CGU The recoverable amount of the GLG CGU is assessed each year using a value in use calculation.
A value in use calculation gives a higher valuation for the GLG CGU as a fair value approach would exclude some of the revenue synergies available to Man through its ability to distribute GLG products using its well established distribution channels, which is unlikely to be fully available to other market participants.
At 31 December 2011, the value in use calculation suggested there was headroom of around $95 million over the carrying value of the GLG goodwill and other intangibles balance and no impairment was considered necessary.
At 30 June 2012, as a result of the challenging economic environment, the recoverable amount of the GLG CGU was again assessed on the same basis.
A goodwill impairment charge of $91 million was deemed necessary and was recognised at 30 June 2012 in the interim financial statements.
Asdisclosed in the interim financial statements at 30 June 2012, the model is sensitive to small changes in the assumptions.
At 30 June 2012, applying various stressed scenarios to investment performance and net flow assumptions over the three year budget period suggested possible impairment in future periods of between $94 million to $1,605 million.
At both 31 December 2011 and 30 June 2012, Duff and Phelps, a specialist valuation firm, was appointed to provide an estimate of the recoverable amount of the GLG CGU.
The valuations and the associated headroom or impairment in these periods were supported by their work as an independent valuation expert.
At 31 December 2012, Duff and Phelps have not been re-appointed as it has been established that their valuation methodology and outcome is not significantly different from the internal valuation calculation that is currently being applied.
The recoverable amount of the GLG CGU has again been assessed at 31 December 2012 using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation uses cash flow projections based on the approved budget for the year to 31 December 2013 and a further two years of projections 2014 and 2015 plus a terminal value.
The following valuation analysis is based on best practice guidance whereby a terminal value is calculated at the end of a short discrete budget period and assumes no growth in asset flows after this three year budget period above the long-term growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation are represented by the compound average annualised growth in funds under management FUM over the three year budget period and the discount rates applied to the modelled cash flows.
These are shown in the table below.
The discount rates are the same as those used at 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2011.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over 3 years 8.5% Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% The pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates is 12.2% and 21.1% respectively.
The terminal value is calculated at the end of 2015.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing FUM at 31 December 2015 and applying a mid-point of a range of historical multiples, being 13 times for management fees and 5.5 times for performance fees.
This is equivalent to an overall terminal growth rate of 1.3%.
GLGs FUM at 31 December 2012 and the budgeted FUM over the three year budget period are lower in comparison to the modelled FUM in the valuein use calculation at 30 June 2012, reflecting the on-going challenging market conditions resulting in a more cautious outlook for growth in funds under management.
The decrease in FUM, partly offset by a reduction in GLGs costs from the cost saving initiatives, has resulted in a decrease in the value in use calculation for the GLG CGU with a value of $867 million as at 31 December 2012.
The total carrying value of the GLG CGU, including goodwill, is assessed to be $1,613 million, resulting in a goodwill impairment of $746 million.
This impairment has been recognised accordingly at 31December 2012, with a total impairment charge of $837 million for the year ended 31 December 2012 including the $91 million recognised at 30June 2012.
A summary of the factors attributing to the change in the value of the GLG CGU from 31 December 2011, with the amount attributable to each change if these factors were changed in this order, is shown in the table below.
$m Value of GLG business at 31 December 2011 1,812 Decrease in funds under management growth assumption 803 Changes in calculation of value attributable to management and performance fees 142 Value of GLG business at 31 December 2012 867 Note: The difference between the value of the GLG business at 31 December 2012 of $867 million and the value of the goodwill and other acquired intangible assets allocated to the GLG business of $817 million relates to leasehold improvements and equipment of $45 million and capitalised computer software of $5 million that has been allocated to the GLG business.
79 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 12.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued The decline in the funds under management growth assumption reflects the on-going challenging market conditions, weighted more towards current experience rather than longer term historical averages, in particular reflecting net outflows of $1,033 million in the second half of 2012.
This contributed to a decrease of approximately $803 million in the value of the GLG CGU.
The value attributable to management and performance fees has decreased as a result of the terminal value being calculated by applying a mid-point of a range of historic multiples, equating to an overall terminal growth rate of 1.3%, which is lower than the overall terminal growth rate applied previously.
The table below shows two adverse scenarios, whereby the base case key assumptions are changed to stressed assumptions.
These stressed assumptions are applied to decrease the compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years to 5% in the first sensitivity: and to 0% in the second sensitivity.
The table below shows the effect of these scenarios and the associated increase in the modelled impairment charge that would result.
The results of these sensitivities make no allowance for actions that management would take if such market conditions persisted.
Stressed assumptions to change compound average annualised growth in FUM to: 5% 0% Increase in modelled impairment $m 223 394 If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 12% and 18% respectively, it would result inincreased modelled impairment of $17 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in decreased modelled impairment of $18million.
If the mid-point of the range of historical multiples for management and performance fees used to calculate the terminal value were increased by 1 to 14 times and 6.5 times respectively, it would result in decreased modelled impairment of around $90 million.
If they were decreased by 1 to 12 times and 4.5 respectively, it would result in increased modelled impairment of around $90 million.
FRM cash generating unit The FRM CGU includes the legacy Man Multi-Manager business and the acquired FRM business.
At 30 June 2012 and 31 December 2011, the FRM CGU included the legacy Man Multi-Manager business only as the FRM business was acquired in July 2012.
The recoverable amount of the FRM CGU was reviewed at 31 December 2011 by assessing the fair value of the business based on market earnings multiples applied to the post-tax net earnings for calendar year 2011.
It was concluded that no impairment charge was required.
At 30 June 2012, as a result of the challenging economic environment, the recoverable amount of the legacy Man Multi-Manager CGU was assessed using a value in use calculation.
A goodwill impairment charge of $142 million was deemed necessary at 30 June 2012 and was recognised in the interim financial statements.
As with the GLG CGU, the recoverable amount of the FRM CGU has again been assessed at 31 December 2012 using a value in use calculation.
The recoverable amount at 31 December 2012 includes the previous Man Multi-Manager and the acquired FRM business.
The value in use calculation follows the same methodology as for the GLG CGU.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over 3 years Guaranteed products -22% Institutional FoF and open-ended products 5.2% Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% In the above table for the model assumptions, the pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates is 12.7% and19.0% respectively.
The terminal value is calculated based on the projected closing funds under management at 31December 2015 and applying historical market multiples.
This is equivalent to an overall terminal growth rate of 1.6%.
As a result of the FRM acquisition during the year and the level of Man specific synergies from the acquisition, as well as the decrease in costs as a result of the cost saving initiatives, the value in use calculation suggests a value for the FRM CGU with significant headroom over the carrying value of the business.
80 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 Financial statements continued 12.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued In an adverse scenario, the compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years would have to decrease for guaranteed products and institutional FoF and open-ended products to -39% and -9.4% respectively as a result of a combination of declined net investment performance and net flows for any impairment to arise.
If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 11% and 18% respectively, it would result indecreased modelled headroom of $18 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in increased modelled headroom of $19million.
AHL cash generating unit The recoverable amount of the AHL CGU was reviewed at 31 December 2011 by assessing the fair value of the business based on market earnings multiples applied to the post-tax net earnings for calendar year 2011.
The fair value less costs to sell valuation indicated a significant amount of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL CGU at 31 December 2011, and there were no realistic scenarios which would result in impairment beingnecessary.
As with the GLG and FRM CGUs, the recoverable amount of the AHL CGU has been assessed at 31 December 2012 using a value in use calculation.
The value in use calculation follows the same methodology as for the GLG and FRM CGUs.
Compound average annualised growth in FUM over 3 years Guaranteed products -18% Open-ended products 3.1% Discount rate post-tax Net management fees 11% Net performance fees 17% In the above table for the model assumptions, the pre-tax equivalent of the net management fee and net performance fee discount rates is 12.8% and 20.0% respectively.
This is equivalent to an overall terminal growth rate of 1.7%.
The value in use calculation for the AHL CGU again indicates a significant amount of headroom over the carrying value of the AHL CGU.
In an adverse scenario, the compound average annualised growth in FUM over three years for guaranteed products and open-ended products would have to decrease to -31% and -5.6% respectively as a result of a combination of declined net investment performance and net flows for any impairment to arise.
If the net management fee and net performance fee post-tax discount rates were increased by 1% to 11% and 18% respectively, it would result indecreased modelled headroom of $37 million.
If the discount rates were decreased by 1%, it would result in increased modelled headroom of $38million.
Acquisition of FRM business On 17 July 2012, Man acquired the entire issued share capital of FRM Holdings Limited Financial Risk Management FRM, a global hedge fund research and investment specialist with funds under management at the date of acquisition of $8.3 billion.
The consideration to FRM shareholders comprised approximately $66 million in cash for the acquisition balance sheet and two earn out payments, payable in cash following the first and third anniversaries of closing, on a sliding scale dependent on levels of run rate net management fees as well as a 47.5% of net performance fees generated within three years of the acquisition date.
Cash balances of $106 million were acquired as part of the acquisition balance sheet, which more than covered the $66 million of initial cash consideration, resulting in a net cash inflow of $40 million on acquisition.
In addition, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Limited SMTB, a 5% shareholder in FRM, exchanged its shareholding for a holding of preference shares in RBH Holdings Jersey Limited, the Man subsidiary which acquired FRM.
This shareholding entitles SMTB to a dividend corresponding to a 2.65% per annum share of the net management and performance fee revenues generated from the acquired FRM funds under management and new funds under management raised from SMTB sales.
