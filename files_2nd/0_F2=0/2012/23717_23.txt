ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 55 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Operating segments From a management perspective, the Group has three operating units and therefore presents three operating segments for segment reporting purposes: F&C: F&C REIT: and Thames River Capital TRC.
While there are different sources of revenue and distinct distribution channels within operating segments, and assets under management can be categorised by client type and asset class, the Directors do not consider these to constitute separate operating segments within the meaning of IFRS 8: Operating Segments.
Management monitors the results of its three operating segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment revenue, operating expenses, finance revenue, finance costs and profit loss for the year include transactions between operating segments, which are eliminated on consolidation.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those of the Group.
Operating segments continued Revenues from two external clients each represent 10% or more of the Groups total revenues.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 59 6.
Exceptional income and expenditure a Other exceptional net operating expenses The Group has classified the following operating expenses income as exceptional: 2012 2011 Notes m m Exceptional employment expenses i 8.2 8.7 TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans ii 6.2 4.6 Exceptional outsourcing expenses iii 3.3 2.7 TRC Commutation expenses iv 1.6 5.7 F&C Partners litigation expenses v 1.3 1.9 Exceptional premises expenses vi 1.3 F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP income vii 4.8 TRC integration expenses viii 0.2 21.9 19.0 i Exceptional employment expenses During 2011, the Board initiated actions to achieve staff cost savings as a result of the operations outsourcing and the subsequent strategic review process.
As a result, some 8.7m of non-recurring redundancy and related staff costs were incurred during that year in order to achieve the targeted level of recurring staff cost savings.
During the year ended 31 December 2012 further strategic review initiatives have been implemented to achieve additional staff cost savings, resulting in the recognition of 8.2m of non-recurring employment-related expenses.
The Directors consider these non-recurring employment expenses to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded them from the measurement of underlying earnings in each financial year.
ii TRC Management Retention and Incentive Plans As a condition of the acquisition of TRC, the Group established a Management Retention Plan MRP and Management Incentive Plan MIP to retain and incentivise certain TRC personnel.
The MRP expense including NIC recognised in the Income Statement is 6.2m 2011: 4.7m.
No MIP expense was incurred in 2012, as during 2011 it was assessed that none of the performance criteria would be met and, as a result, the cumulative charge previously recognised was reversed and an associated credit of 0.1m was recognised in the 2011 Income Statement.
Details of these share-based payment arrangements are given in notes 25 e and f. Given the quantum and nature of these awards, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the associated net expense as exceptional and exclude them from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
iii Exceptional outsourcing expenses During 2012, a further 2.3m of advisory and consultancy costs were incurred in respect of the continued execution of the outsourcing of certain of the Groups back and middle office investment operations to State Street.
In addition, 1.0m of non-recurring costs were incurred as part of the strategic review activity to rationalise other outsourced activities of the Group.
The Directors consider these project costs to be exceptional in nature and have therefore excluded this expense from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
iv TRC Commutation expenses The Divisional Members of TRC Investment Teams entered into put and call options at the time of the TRC acquisition, which, if exercised, will typically transfer up to 20% of their entitlement to management fee profits to the F&C Group.
Under IFRS, the share element of the consideration payable under these Commutation arrangements requires to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
The net expense of 1.6m recognised in 2012 comprises a 3.5m charge for the Investment Teams where options have been, or are expected to be exercised, offset by a credit of 1.9m for those teams where it is no longer expected that F&C would exercise its call option.
At 31 December 2012, F&Cs call options are the only remaining options: they become exercisable in September 2013.
Given the capital nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider it appropriate to treat the total Commutation expense as exceptional in nature and exclude it from the measurement of underlying earnings for each financial year.
v F&C Partners litigation expenses As highlighted in note 23, the F&C Partners litigation was settled in June 2012, resulting in a net expense of 1.3m being recognised in the Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Given the quantum and nature of this expense and the previous costs incurred, the Directors continue to consider it appropriate to treat these costs as exceptional in nature and exclude them from the measurement of underlying earnings in both financial years.
60 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 6.
Exceptional income and expenditure continued vi Exceptional premises expenses As part of the strategic review programme, significant annualised cost savings are expected as a result of premises restructuring activity.
As part of this programme, following lease changes and restructuring work at the Groups Head Office in London, a net expense of 1.3m has been recognised in the Income Statement for the year to 31 December 2012.
This comprises 2.7m of non-recurring premises-related costs associated with the restructuring activities, offset by a 1.4m credit in respect of an accelerated release of lease incentive liabilities.
vii F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP income 30% of F&C REIT, the Groups property asset management business, is held by the former owners of REIT, two of whom occupy key management roles within F&C REIT.
The former owners have the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT by a further 10% through the achievement of performance targets over the six-year period to 31 December 2014.
This earn-out mechanism meets the criteria of, and is accounted for as, a share-based payment.
In 2011 it was assessed that the performance target is unlikely to be achieved in any of the remaining performance periods.
As a result, the cumulative charge previously recognised was reversed and a credit of 4.8m was recognised in the 2011 Income Statement.
As at 31 December 2012 this assessment remains unchanged.
This credit has been excluded from underlying earnings as this arrangement is considered to be of a capital nature.
Further details of this arrangement are given in note 25 c. viii TRC integration expenses Following the acquisition of TRC in 2010, the Group incurred a number of integration expenses associated with the alignment of certain activities within the enlarged Group in 2011.
No such costs were incurred in the year ended 31 December 2012.
Given the nature of this expense, the Directors considered it appropriate to treat it as exceptional and excluded it from the measurement of underlying earnings.
b F&C REIT put option fair value gain 2012 2011 m m F&C REIT put option fair value gain 11.5 8.7 The fair value of the F&C REIT put option liability, as disclosed in note 27, reflects the value of the portion of the F&C REIT business which is currently owned by the non-controlling interest partners and which is the subject of options.
The 11.5m reduction in the fair value of the options during 2012 has been recognised as a gain in the Income Statement 2011: gain of 8.7m.
The Directors consider the value of these options and movements therein to be of a capital nature, and have therefore excluded these gains from the measurement of underlying earnings.
c TRC acquisition consideration adjustments 2012 2011 m m Net asset consideration adjustment 0.1 Deferred consideration adjustment 7.5 7.6 The total consideration of 48.6m recognised in 2010 for the acquisition of TRC included a 7.5m estimate of further cash consideration and 7.5m of estimated conditional consideration payable if certain performance criteria were achieved.
During 2011, a payment of 7.4m was made to the vendors of TRC, under the terms of the Sale and Purchase Agreement, representing an adjustment to the initial cash consideration to reflect the excess of net assets acquired over and above the agreed target.
As the payment was less than the estimate of 7.5m, the excess of 0.1m was credited to the Income Statement in accordance with IFRS.
Neither of the conditional consideration performance targets relating to the acquisition were achieved.
As a result, the associated liability of 7.5m was also released to the 2011 Income Statement in accordance with IFRS.
Due to the capital nature of these items, the Directors excluded the total credit of 7.6m from the calculation of underlying earnings for 2011.

Two UK corporation tax rate changes were substantively enacted during 2012.
The effect of the tax rate changes enacted during the year has been to decrease the net deferred tax assets of the Group by 0.2m comprising a 0.1m credit through the Income Statement and a 0.3m charge to equity reflecting the deferred tax that is expected to reverse through equity.
The current corporation tax rate of 24% became effective from 1 April 2012, leading to a statutory UK corporation tax rate of 24.5% for 2012 for the Group.
The 1% reduction to 23%, effective from 1 April 2013, was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012 and will lead to a statutory UK corporation tax rate of 23.25% for 2013.
No rate changes have been substantively enacted since the reporting date.
The Directors are of the view that, due to the significant level of estimation required, it is not yet possible to quantify the effect of the proposed 3% rate reduction to 20% in future years, although this will further reduce the Groups current tax charge in future and impact the Groups deferred tax assets liabilities recognised in the Statement of Financial Position.

Earnings per share Basic earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted earnings loss per share amounts are calculated by dividing the earnings loss for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares at the reporting date.
In the opinion of the Directors the underlying earnings as quantified in the Reconciliation of earnings loss table below, more accurately reflects the underlying earnings performance of the Group.

In the period between the reporting date and the approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements, 155,356 share awards 2011: 1,112,958 vested which were satisfied by the utilisation of own shares held by Employee Benefit Trusts and 201,369 shares were distributed from holdings in a nominee capacity in respect of TRC Commutations.
Potential future dilution The following share-based payment arrangements could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future, but were not included in the above calculation of diluted earnings per share because they were either anti-dilutive for the years presented or had not met the relevant performance criteria at the reporting date: Long-Term Remuneration Plan restricted awards F&C REIT variable NCI SBP This earn-out arrangement gives the F&C REIT NCI partners the opportunity to increase their ownership of F&C REIT from 30% to 40% before 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2012, the Directors do not expect any of the ownership percentage to transfer.
Any transfer would potentially dilute the profits attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
However, the principle of this incentive arrangement is that the incremental profits which would become attributable to NCI as a result of achieving the performance criteria are funded from the increased level of absolute profits generated by F&C REIT for the year in which vesting arises, rather than diluting the current level of profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
There can be no guarantee that, subsequent to vesting, the higher level of profits which met the vesting criteria would be sustainable.
TRC Management Incentive Plan ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 65 10.
Earnings per share continued TRC Commutation arrangements F&C has call options to acquire up to 20% of Investment Teams entitlement to management fee profits.
The exercise of these options would be expected to enhance the profits attributable to equity holders of the parent.
However, there can be no guarantee that, subsequent to the exercise of the options, a higher level of absolute profits would be sustainable.
Share Save Scheme 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme At 31 December 2012 all options outstanding have vested.
These have exercise prices between 139.00p and 240.83p and are anti-dilutive as the option prices are above the average share price for the year.
Details of all potentially dilutive share awards, together with the total number of awards outstanding at each reporting date, are disclosed in note 25.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 67 13.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill has arisen from various business combinations and, reflecting the Groups reportable operating segments disclosed in note 1, is represented by three cash generating units CGUs, as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m F&C 467.2 467.2 F&C REIT 127.9 127.9 Thames River Capital 16.8 16.8 611.9 611.9 Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually at individual CGU level, or when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
The carrying value of goodwill attributable to each CGU was tested for impairment as at 31 December 2012, as described below: to date, none of the CGUs has suffered any impairment of goodwill.
Investment management contracts management contracts Management contracts predominantly relate to contracts arising from business acquisitions.
Management contracts are amortised over their expected useful lives and are tested for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment are identified.
No such indicators have been identified since the last impairment review undertaken as at 31 December 2008 and therefore no impairment review of management contracts has been undertaken this year.
Management contract impairment losses recognised in prior years relate entirely to the F&C operating segment: the accumulated impairment losses at 31 December 2012 were 218.3m 31 December 2011: 218.3m.
The foreign exchange losses recognised in the year arise from the relative weakening of the Euro over the course of 2012, decreasing the value of Euro-denominated contracts, primarily F&C insurance contracts, in Sterling terms.
The categories of management contracts, their carrying amounts at the year end, remaining amortisation periods and estimated useful lives are as follows: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 Remaining Estimated Remaining Estimated Net book amortisation useful Net book amortisation useful values period life values period life m years years m years years RSAI insurance contracts 10 0.3 10 F&C OEICs RSAI retail contracts 1.9 0 2 10 4.7 3 10 F&C insurance contracts 25.8 2 10 41.6 3 10 F&C institutional contracts 3.0 2 10 4.8 3 10 F&C investment trust contracts 7.5 3 10 9.7 4 10 F&C advisory and sub-advisory contracts 8.8 2 10 14.0 3 10 Private equity fund of funds 0.8 12 20 0.8 13 20 REIT property contracts 27.1 3 7 37.3 4 7 Thames River Capital contracts 9.624 15.4 3 4 84.5 128.6 Royal Sun Alliance Insurance RSAI.
Impairment testing of goodwill The recoverable amount of the CGUs has been determined on their value in use including terminal value at each respective testing date for 2011 and 2012.
The value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flow projections based on the latest annual financial budget, and managements forecasts.
A Euro Sterling exchange rate of1.23 1, which was assumed for the purposes of the 2013 budget 2012 budget:1.16 1, has been kept constant for determining future cash flows.
A long-term growth rate is used to extrapolate the cash flows reflecting the nature of the Groups business and the Boards current view that there is no reason to believe that the CGUs will not continue in operation in perpetuity.
The key assumptions adopted in these calculations for each operating segment are as follows: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 9.15% 9.15% 11.15% 10.15% 10.15% 12.15% Long-term market growth rate 5.35% 4.45% 5.65% 5.20% 4.30% 5.45% Inflation rate 3.80% 3.80% 3.80% 3.95% 3.95% 3.95% The costs included in year one of the projections reflect those included in the budget for the respective year.
68 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 13.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital to estimate a market relevant rate, calculated as at the year end, and takes into account the relative risks associated with the Groups various revenue streams included in the respective operating segments.
The same discount rate has been applied to the F&C and F&C REIT CGUs, reflecting the fact that the Board considers that the risk profiles are similar across those segments, with a degree of commonality in their client base.
Indeed, were it not for the distinct internal governance arrangements and separate management structures in place, the F&C REIT business would form part of a larger F&C CGU.
The discount rates disclosed above are the post-tax rates which have been applied in the projections: the pre-tax discount rates are 11.10% and 13.40% for F&C F&C REIT and TRC respectively 2011: 12.50% and 14.65% respectively.
All discount rates shown subsequently within this note are stated after tax.
Revenues are based on the budget for each operating segment, and managements net business flow forecasts for the subsequent four years.
Thereafter, revenues have been grown in line with the Groups long-term view of market growth, consistent with that experienced historically, in the long-term, across the markets in which assets are invested.
The different rates reflect the composite mix of assets held in each operating segment for each period.
Net new business revenues are included at the levels assumed in the 2013 budget and managements forecasts up to 2017 with no further net new business included thereafter.
Additional costs associated with the increased revenues have been included in the projections, primarily to reflect variable remuneration costs.
Where revenues earned from significant contracts with a fixed term are assumed to terminate at the end of the fixed term, the operating costs have been reduced by an amount which assumes associated profit margins of 85% 2011: 50%.
Projected operating costs for the first year are driven by the budgeted profit margins for each operating segment for 2013.
Thereafter, both existing budgeted costs and, as noted above, further costs added associated with net new business revenue forecasts have been grown at inflation rates to accord with anticipated future salary and other cost increases, with specific reductions made in respect of cost savings targeted for 2014 and 2015.
Values in use are compared to the carrying values of goodwill, attributable management contracts and other intangible assets net of associated deferred tax provisions, and property, plant and equipment in order to ascertain whether any impairment exists.
As this annual impairment review of goodwill indicated surpluses in all segments, no impairment has been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill 2011: nil.
The key assumptions noted in the above table are those to which the calculated values in use are most sensitive.
These assumptions, together with the inclusion in the projections of forecast net new business revenues and associated costs, result in the following surpluses of goodwill: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC m m m m m m Excess of recoverable amount over carrying value 866.1 43.9 69.4 557.8 16.8 94.4 In order to assess the sensitivity of the key assumptions on the carrying values of goodwill, an analysis was conducted to ascertain the change that would be required to derive values in use which approximated to the carrying values of goodwill, and beyond which impairment would arise.
The absolute levels, on a standalone basis, of the key assumptions which most closely resulted in a match in the values in use to the carrying values of goodwill were as follows: 31 December 2012 31 December 2011 F&C F&C REIT TRC F&C F&C REIT TRC Discount rate 18.28% 11.37% 28.81% 16.97% 11.02% 30.80% Long-term market growth rate 1.01% 2.16% 2.37% 1.67% 3.49% 2.29% Inflation rate 7.75% 6.21% 9.74% 8.39% 5.10% 11.83% Per cent achievement of new business targets 0.00% 30.93% 0.00% 0.00% 72.56% 0.00% ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 69 14.
Financial investments The following assets are designated as available for sale: 2012 2011 Unquoted investments m m At 1 January 1.7 3.5 Fair value gains in the year 0.7 1.5 Realised fair value gains transferred to the Income Statement 1.1 3.3 At 31 December 1.3 1.7 Unquoted investments include the Groups direct investment, co-investments and certain carried interest entitlements in private equity limited partnerships.
The investments have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
The fair value of the unquoted investments has been estimated using International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
The Directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the valuation technique applied to unquoted shares which are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position, and the related realised fair value gains recorded in the Income Statement, are reasonable and the most appropriate at the reporting date.
Included within the unquoted financial investments at 31 December 2012 are 0.1m 31 December 2011: 0.1m of equity instruments measured at the price of recent investments.
The fair value of these investments cannot be measured reliably as the Group does not have access to the underlying information to produce fair value valuations for these investments.
These investments consist of loans and carried interest in private equity limited partnerships.
These investments are managed by external fund managers and the Group obtains income when the investments are realised.
The Group intends to hold these investments until all the private equity investments are realised.
In 2012, the Group received 0.4m 2011: 0.4m in respect of the investments held at cost.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they cannot be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group, and they have arisen in companies that have not reported taxable profits for some time.

Financial instruments a Analysis of assets and liabilities at the reporting date Financial investments held in relation to the activities of the Groups insurance subsidiary have been classified as fair value through profit or loss within current assets.
Stocks of units and shares are held in relation to fund management activities and are classified as held for trading within current assets.
Financial investments included within non-current assets are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value or at amortised cost if fair value cannot be measured reliably.
Other loans and receivables included within non-current assets are carried at amortised cost.

From F&Cs perspective, the risks and rewards of managing these assets are the same as other assets under management, as the financial risks and rewards attributable to the assets invested fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the Groups clients.
Hence, while a number of significant financial instruments are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of this subsidiary, the key risk to the Group is the impact on the level of management fees which are earned from this entity and which are directly affected by the underlying value of policyholder assets.
While F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited had some insurance risks, these risks were fully reinsured, thereby negating any net insurance risk to the Groups equity holders.
The amounts included in the Statement of Financial Position in respect of assets and liabilities held within unit-linked funds are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 134.2 447.8 Loans and receivables: Deferred acquisition costs 0.1 0.1 Trade and other receivables 0.3 0.1 Payables: Trade and other payables 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 2.3 25.1 Total unit-linked assets less liabilities 136.9 472.8 Excludes 2.2m of non-linked policyholders cash 31 December 2011: 3.0m.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table: Securities The fair value of listed investments is based on quoted bid market prices at the reporting date without any deduction for transaction costs.
The fair value of unlisted investments has been valued in accordance with International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines and in accordance with the underlying limited partnership agreements.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the Subordinated Notes and Guaranteed Loan Notes is based on a quoted market price at the reporting date.
Unquoted investments Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market-related rate for a similar instrument at the reporting date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market-related data at the reporting date.

This includes a number of vacant or sub-let properties which were either previously occupied or are partially occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments where significant, after taking into account existing and expected sub-tenant contractual arrangements.
The remaining terms are for up to eight years, although a significant element of this provision is expected to be utilised within the next year.
Assumptions have been made as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future.
All leases are for minimum guaranteed rentals.
The provision is subject to uncertainties over time, including market rent reviews and break options within the lease arrangements.
In addition, exposure could exist if an existing tenant defaulted or went into liquidation or administration.
NIC on share schemes The provision for national insurance contributions NIC on share schemes represents the potential employers NIC liabilities in respect of a number of share-based payment schemes operated by the Group.
The provision is subject to uncertainties in respect of the extent to which performance conditions are met, movements in the Companys share price, the extent to which awards are forfeited and, where eligible, the timing of when employees choose to exercise options.
The current element of the provision for NIC on share schemes relates to awards which are expected to vest within one year.
At 31 December 2012, 2.5m 31 December 2011: 2.4m of financial investments were held by the Group to partially fund the NIC liability on the Deferred Investment Plan and Deferred Investment Option Plan.
This is disclosed in note 17 a i 2.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 79 23.
Provisions continued Long-term sickness The Group has long-term sickness insurance arrangements which cover the cost of absence from work of all current employees.
However, the cost of employees who went on long-term absence prior to these arrangements being established are self-insured by the Group.
The provision represents the expected present value of income protection payments due to these individuals.
This provision has been quantified on the assumption that all employees currently on long-term sick leave do not return to the employment of the Group.
The discount rate and salary growth assumptions used in each year are identical to those used for the purposes of determining UK defined benefit pension obligations.
Guaranteed product The provision for the guaranteed product represented the actuarially assessed cost of meeting potential obligations under certain investment products which have a guaranteed payout in the event of death of the investor.
The underlying investment plan was closed to new investors during 2004 and insurance arrangements are now in place to cover any exposure to the Group.
The remaining provision of 0.4m was therefore released during 2012.
Long-term service award This provision represents the obligation in respect of long-term service benefits to which some employees are entitled, including incremental holiday entitlement and long-term service awards.
F&C Partners litigation In June 2012, following a successful outcome from the Court of Appeal regarding the level of costs and interest to be borne by F&C in respect of the F&C Partners litigation, a full and final payment of 0.65m was paid to the founder partners.
As a result, the excess provision of 1.35m was released during the year.
Further details of this litigation were disclosed in the Annual Report and Financial Statements for previous reporting periods.
Pension benefits The Group operates defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to the Group.
A former Chairman of the Group, Mr R W Jenkins, has a pension entitlement which commenced in January 2011 and is adjusted in line with the Retail Price Index on 1 January in each year.
The annual entitlement as at 1 January 2012 was 125,000.
The Group has not earmarked any assets to date with respect to this liability.
The net pension deficit is recognised under non-current liabilities in the Statement of Financial Position and is stated gross of the related deferred tax asset.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2012 by qualified independent actuaries.
The pension deficits of the Group are summarised in aggregate and by scheme as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Aggregate Note m m Fair value of plan assets 24 d 232.7 215.9 Benefit obligations 24 d 256.8 236.4 Total pension deficit 24 d 24.1 20.5 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 By scheme m m F&C Asset Management Pension Plan FCAM Plan 10.8 10.3 F&C Netherlands pension plan 9.4 6.6 F&C Ireland pension plan 0.5 0.4 F&C Portugal pension plan R W Jenkins pension 3.4 3.2 Total pension deficit 24.1 20.5 80 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted, based on the actual asset allocation, to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
b Major assumptions used by schemes actuaries in respect of benefit obligations i Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used for the main UK defined benefit scheme and the unfunded UK obligation are: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Mortality table for males retiring in the future S1NMA L-1 CMI 2011 1.25% S1NMA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for females retiring in the future S1NFA L-1 CMI 2011 1.25% S1NFA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for current male pensioners S1NMA L-1 CMI 2011 1.25% S1NMA L MC min1% 1 Mortality table for current female pensioners S1NFA L-1 CMI 2011 1.25% S1NFA L MC min1% 1 The mortality assumptions for the non-UK schemes are: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 F&C Netherlands Prognosetafel 2012 2062 generational table Prognosetafel 2010 2060 generational table F&C Ireland Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates Compulsory Purchase Annuity Rates F&C Portugal Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Males TV 73 77 rated down 1 year Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years Females TV 88 90 rated down 2 years ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 81 24.
Pension benefits continued ii Impact of mortality assumptions To demonstrate what these mortality assumptions mean in respect of the FCAM Plan, the expected ages at death of members retiring at age 60 are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Years Years Expected age at death for a male retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 92 91 Expected age at death for a female retiring in the future at age 60, currently aged 40 93 92 Expected age at death for a current male pensioner aged 60 90 89 Expected age at death for a current female pensioner aged 60 91 90 iii Cost of annuities The table below summarises the cost of providing annuities of 1 per annum with associated death benefits and pension increases for UK members currently aged 40, retiring at age 60, based on the assumptions used for the pension disclosures: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Male annuity 28.40 27.50 Female annuity 27.60 26.70 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 4.50% 2011: 4.70%.
The rates also assume two-thirds of the members benefit will be paid to spouses: a five-year guarantee is provided: and pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension will increase by 3.07% 2011: 3.20% per annum.
iv Discount and growth assumptions The range of assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 Discount rate 3.90% 4.50% 4.70% 5.20% Rate of salary increase 2.00% 3.00% 2.00% 4.00% Rate of price inflation CPI 2.00% 2.45% 2.00% 2.60% Rate of inflation increase RPI 3.15% 3.30% The range of assumptions used to determine net pension cost for the year are as follows: 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.70% 5.20% 5.30% Weighted average expected long-term return on plan assets 3.10% 5.20% 4.91% 6.04% Rate of salary increase 2.00% 4.00% 2.00% 4.00% Rate of inflation increase RPI 2.00% 3.30% 2.00% 3.50% v Sensitivities An estimate of the sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the schemes liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Estimated impact on scheme liabilities Inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.7% Salaries Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 0.0% Pensions Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 1.3% Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2.2% Life expectancy Increase decrease by 1 year Increase decrease by 2.8% 82 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.

Trustee Board of the FCAM Plan The appointment of Trustees is determined by the FCAM Plans trust documentation.
The Trustee Board currently consists of three employerappointed Trustees, three member-selected Trustees and an independent Trustee who is currently the Chairman of the Trustee Board.
Of the current employer-appointed and member-selected Trustees, four are employees of F&C and active members of the FCAM Plan, one is a deferred member and one is retired and receiving a pension from the FCAM Plan.
84 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 24.
Pension benefits continued Relationship between F&C and the Trustees of the FCAM Plan The FCAM Plans assets are held in a separate Trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the FCAM Plan are required to act in the best interests of the FCAM Plans beneficiaries.
ii Other pension schemes F&C Portugal Certain employees in Portugal participate in the multi-employer scheme, Fundo fide Pensoes do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugus.
The assets and liabilities of the scheme are separately identifiable.
There are no Trustees, and F&C Portugal controls the assets relating to the F&C members of the scheme.
The pension plan has two parts: the Basic Plan and the Complementary Plan.
The Complementary Plan provides an old age pension as well as death and disability benefits.
From 1 January 2011, this scheme has been integrated into the Social Security system and part of the employees occupational pension benefits is funded through the Social Security system from that date.
With effect from 1 January 2012, F&C Portugal decided to terminate the old age pension benefit provided to members from the Complementary Plan, and paid the value of the accrued benefits to the members or to individual policies for the members.
F&C Netherlands The Plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
There are no Trustees, but the Works Council participates in negotiations in respect of potential changes to the Plan.
F&C Ireland The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in Ireland.
There are currently four Trustees of this plan, all of whom are employees of F&C.
f Future funding requirements FCAM Plan A revised schedule of contributions was agreed in January 2011, under which the Group agreed to pay a minimum of 17.0% of Pensionable Salaries plus 3.0m per annum in respect of deficit recovery contributions, 0.5m per annum in respect of administrative expenses and any additional amounts required as a result of the asset underperformance guarantee.
Further, to the extent that the Group repays any amount of its fixed or floating rate notes after 1 January 2011, then the Group shall pay, within one month of that repayment, a special contribution to reduce the deficit determined in the valuation at 31 March 2010 in the same proportion as the aggregate reduction in fixed or floating rate notes.
If there is more than one such reduction, then the special contributions necessary shall be computed taking into account the aggregate percentage reduction in fixed or floating rate notes since 1 January 2011 and the amount of any previous such special contribution paid.
For the avoidance of doubt, a repayment does not include a repayment of the notes from the issue of a capital instrument specified for that purpose.
The minimum estimated contribution expected to be paid into the Plan during 2013 is 5.3m 2012: 5.5m.
As the FCAM Plan is a closed scheme, under the projected unit method the current service cost will tend to increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as the average age of members increases.
Non-UK schemes The figures in the table below assume that contributions will continue to be paid to the overseas schemes at the level paid in 2012, with appropriate increases for future changes in salary assumptions.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into the Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: Contributions paid m 2011 6.6 2012 8.1 Expected future contributions m 2013 6.4 2014 5.9 2015 5.8 2016 5.7 2017 5.8 ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 85 24.
Pension benefits continued g Risk management i FCAM Plan The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the FCAM Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment advisor and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment managers.
The performance objectives are long-term, and the Trustees monitor the investment managers on a regular basis in order to ensure that the Plan is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
The results of an asset-liability review undertaken alongside the 31 March 2010 actuarial valuation of the Plan have been used to assist the Trustees and the Group in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a significant increase in the FCAM Plans deficit by providing information used to determine the FCAM Plans investment strategy.
Asset allocation During the year, the Trustees, with the agreement of F&C, decided to further diversify the FCAM Plans investment strategy by introducing an allocation to diversified growth funds.
This allocation was funded by the release of collateral received when the Liability Driven Investment LDI pooled hedging strategy was switched from LIBOR to SONIA-based funds.
In previous periods, diversifying allocations to both UK and overseas equity-linked bond funds, an overseas private equity fund and funds investing in secured leases have been made.
Previously the Trustees have implemented a LDI approach to the investment strategy.
Other allocations to alternative asset classes may be made in the future.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the FCAM Plan.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
The equity-linked bond funds also provide a degree of matching to the liabilities but in addition retain an exposure to equity market movements.
Currency risk In order to increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the FCAM Plan invests in overseas assets.
However, the FCAM Plans liabilities are denominated entirely in Sterling and, therefore, there is a risk that the appreciation of Sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas assets.
Operational risk The investment managers do not directly hold any of the FCAM Plans securities.
These are held by an external custodian.
The assets are ringfenced from F&Cs creditors and are therefore transferable.
ii Non-UK schemes The plan in The Netherlands is financed via an insurance contract.
The value of the plan assets is the value of the reserve which the insurance company holds to match guaranteed pension liabilities.
These reserves are, in effect, fixed interest instruments, so provide a reasonable match to pension liabilities.
The plan in Portugal is part of an industry-wide banking sector plan.
Each participant company holds a share of the assets, which are invested using the same asset allocation as the overall plan assets.
F&C Portugal is the asset manager for the overall scheme.
At 31 December 2012, the assets of both the F&C Portugal and F&C Ireland plans were invested in diversified portfolios that consisted primarily of debt and equity securities.

Details of option pricing models and key assumptions used to obtain the fair value of services received, or the fair value of the equity instruments granted, have been disclosed only for awards granted during the year ended 31 December 2012.
Details of awards granted in previous accounting periods are disclosed in the previous years Financial Statements.
The fair value of services received in return for awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The cash-settled element of the awards is based on dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period, being notionally re-invested in F&C Asset Management plc shares.
Once the share awards vest, the value of the notional shares is paid to the employee in cash.
The value of dividend payments has been separated from the equity-settled awards as these are settled in cash.
The cumulative expense for each award is trued-up during the vesting period and at the end of the vesting period, after allowing for actual forfeitures and, where applicable, the extent to which the performance criteria have been met.
The weighted average share price during 2012 was 0.82 2011: 0.74.
The weighted average share price at exercise date during 2012 was 0.80 2011: 0.77.

b The Executive Director Remuneration Plan EDRP Any Executive Director of the Company is eligible to participate in the EDRP.
The EDRP provides for the grant of two different forms of award, Deferred Share Awards and Restricted Share Awards.
There were no Restricted Share Awards outstanding at either 31 December 2012 or 2011.
Deferred Share Awards Awards vest at the end of a three-year period from grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant within the Group.
There were no performance criteria attached to the deferred shares and the vested shares transferred to the participant after vesting.

Share-based payments continued c F&C REIT variable non-controlling interests SBP In accordance with the F&C REIT Partnership Agreement, the F&C REIT minority partners Kendray Properties Limited, Leo No and Ivor Smith have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT Asset Management LLP F&C REIT collectively from 30% to 40%.
A variable NCI entitlement exists as an incentive to achieve increased levels of profit including realisation of future performance fees in return for a potential increased stake in the business.
This variable NCI entitlement is therefore accounted for under IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
The fair value of the award at date of acquisition reflected the value assessed as part of the acquisition valuation.
The fair value of the award is reassessed at each reporting date and this fair value is spread over the relevant vesting period.
The minority partners have the potential to increase their stake in F&C REIT by 3.33% for every year in which the EBITDA performance target of 45.0m is achieved, up to a maximum of 10%.
The performance criteria could be achieved in any year of the six calendar years ending 31 December 2014.
At 31 December 2012 the Directors have continued to assess that the performance target is unlikely to be achieved in any of the remaining performance measurement periods.
The cumulative charge previously recognised was reversed at 31 December 2011, but would be reinstated to the extent that any performance criteria were met.
d F&C REIT Long-Term Remuneration Plan F&C REIT LTRP There are two elements to the Plan which was introduced to incentivise F&C REIT emloyees: i Deferred Award with no performance conditions: and ii Restricted Awards with performance conditions.
Participants are awarded notional units in the F&C REIT Asset Management LLP Group F&C REIT, each equal to 0.00005% of the market value of F&C REIT.
The market value of F&C REIT is determined annually by an independent valuation.
The Deferred Awards vest at the end of a predetermined period from grant date normally three years, subject to the continued employment of the participant.
On vesting, the awards are settled by a cash payment based on the market value of each unit at the end of the vesting period, together with a pro-rated share of distributions made during the vesting period.
No Restricted Awards have been granted under the performance element of this Plan to date.
The number of F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards is as follows: 2012 2011 Units Units Outstanding at 1 January 43,608.24 28,859.60 Granted during the year 19,569.54 15,833.33 Exercised during the year 15,890.98 Forfeited during the year 474.06 219.53 Expired during the year 865.16 Outstanding at 31 December 46,812.74 43,608.24 At 31 December 2012 the following F&C REIT LTRP Deferred Awards were outstanding: No.

Share-based payments continued e Thames River Capital Management Retention Plan TRC MRP The TRC MRP was one of the two new share plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to retain and incentivise key professionals within the TRC Group.
Awards of deferred shares vest three years after completion of the acquisition, subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of one of the two TRC LLPs.
The TRC MRP awards are not subject to any performance criteria.
The TRC MRP includes good and bad leaver provisions.
The number of TRC MRP awards is as follows: 2012 2011 No.

f Thames River Capital Management Incentive Plan TRC MIP The TRC MIP is the second of two plans established at the date of the TRC acquisition to further incentivise TRC employees and members of the two TRC LLPs in the six-year period from the date of acquisition Completion on 1 September 2010.
Awards under the TRC MIP vest upon achievements of specified financial targets as follows: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards vest on the date falling 30 months following Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 31 December 2011 is 15.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 12.5m or less, none of this tranche of shares vests and the number of the shares that vest increases on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: 12.5% of the shares subject to awards vest on the third anniversary of Completion provided that the Run-rate EBITDA of the TRC Group as at 30 June 2012 is 17.0m or more.
If the Run-rate EBITDA is 15.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares vests and the number of the shares that vest increases on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between the two thresholds: and the remaining 75.0% of the shares subject to awards will vest in two equal instalments on each of the fifth and sixth anniversaries of Completion provided that the cumulative EBITDA of the TRC Group for the four-year period to 31 March 2014 is equal to 100.0m or more.
If the cumulative EBITDA is equal to 60.0m or less, none of this tranche of shares will vest and the number of the shares that vest will increase on a linear basis if the Run-rate EBITDA falls between these two thresholds.
The first two specified financial targets were not achieved and the awards expired.
Vesting is also subject to continued employment within the F&C Group or membership of the relevant LLP as the case may be.
The terms of the TRC MIP include good and bad leaver provisions, change of control provisions and a cash-settled element.
In addition, participants in the TRC MIP will receive an additional cash payment up to a maximum aggregate amount of 3.0m, payable at the time that shares are delivered and in proportion to the number of shares which vest.
The Directors believe that the remaining financial target is not expected to be achieved and the cumulative charge was reversed at 31 December 2011.
The number of TRC MIP awards is as follows: 2012 2011 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 14,208,140 14,208,140 Expired during the year 6,218,582 Outstanding at 31 December 7,989,558 14,208,140 No awards were exercisable at 31 December 2012 or 31 December 2011.

g Thames River Capital Commutation arrangements TRC Commutation arrangements The Divisional Members of Investment Teams have entered into put and call options which, if exercised, will transfer value to F&C by way of variation of the entitlements to the allocation of management fee profits as defined in the underlying legal agreements and capital profits in the respective LLP.
The exercise of these options will increase TRC UKs share of the management fee profits of the respective Investment Teams by up to 20%.
These options are exercisable: 18 months after Completion: At the option of the Investment Teams, TRC UK will purchase an additional 10% of the management fee profits of each Investment Team.
The option for Investment Teams to exercise this put option is conditional on that teams respective net fund flows being positive for the twelve months preceding the option exercise period.
36 months after Completion: FCAM has a call option to purchase, through TRC UK, typically, an additional 20% of the management fee profits of each of the Investment Teams.
The level of 20% is reduced by the percentage of any profits which have already been commuted at an earlier date.
The 18 36 months options to acquire such management fee profits may be deferred for a period of twelve months if the F&C EBITDA Multiple, which is one of the components used to quantify the Commutation consideration, is less than five.
The Commutation consideration may be satisfied in two tranches, at F&Cs sole discretion, by: The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to each Divisional Member of such number of F&C shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration, or the payment to the Divisional Members of 50% of the consideration in cash at the relevant Commutation completion date: and The allotment and issue at the relevant Commutation completion date to a Nominee of such number of F&C shares as shall have a value equal to 50% of the consideration Deferred Commutation Shares, or in certain circumstances the payment of 50% of the consideration in cash on the date falling 24 months after the relevant Commutation completion date.
Deferred Commutation Shares shall be released by the Nominee 24 months after the Commutation completion date, provided the Member continues to provide services to the respective LLP or has ceased to do so in certain good leaver circumstances.
The members of the LLPs are considered to be providing services to the Group and as a result, the share element of the Commutation consideration is required to be accounted for as a share-based payment.
It is the intention of the Directors to settle these awards in equity and therefore they have been treated as equity-settled awards.
The maximum payable under Commutation arrangements is 81.4m and F&C has authority to issue a maximum of 122,511,485 shares to settle the consideration payable on exercise of the options.
The options are re-measured at intrinsic value at each reporting date and the total expense is spread over the respective vesting period.
The options are considered to have non-market performance conditions if the options are not exercised, then there is no charge to the Income Statement.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 93 25.
Share-based payments continued Three TRC Investment Teams exercised their put options during the year ended 31 December 2012.
These exercises transferred a further entitlement of the management fee profits typically 10% to the F&C Group.
F&C settled these awards through the issue of FCAM shares.

However, at 31 December 2012, 3.8 million shares relate to the options potentially exercisable by the Group.
The remaining Commutation arrangements are exercisable on 1 September 2013, at the option of the Company.
The shares could vest at dates up to 1 September 2016. h Purchased Equity Plan PEP i F&C Asset Management plc shares The PEP operated in conjunction with the discretionary bonus scheme and was intended to encourage shareholding by management and employees of the Group by providing for the compulsory purchase of shares using annual bonus above a threshold level.
At the Boards discretion, eligible employees who were awarded in a financial year an aggregate bonus in excess of a threshold level, typically 100,000, were required to defer one-third of the element exceeding the threshold into shares comprising either a range of investment products managed by the Group or the Companys shares Compulsory PEP for three years.
The Compulsory PEP is subject to forfeiture in the event that the employee leaves the Group for any reason other than as a good leaver in the three-year retention period.
The number of Compulsory PEP share awards is as follows: 2012 2011 No.
Outstanding at 1 January 691,198 783,727 Exercised during the year 197,388 66,716 Forfeited during the year 25,813 Outstanding at 31 December 493,810 691,198 Exercisable at 31 December 493,810 2,728 The awards exercisable at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 relate to good leavers.
At 31 December 2012 the following awards granted under the PEP to acquire Ordinary Shares were outstanding: No.

ii F&C Investment Funds At the discretion of the Board, the cash bonus may be deferred on a mandatory basis into certain F&C Funds Compulsory Purchased Equity subject to continued service over either three or four years.
This option is available as an alternative to the Compulsory PEP into FCAM plc shares.
The main benefit of this arrangement is to incentivise fund managers to invest in the funds they manage, thereby further aligning employee interests with those of clients.
The settlement of awards from the Compulsory Purchased Equity is made by realisation of the holding in the fund at the vesting date and purchase of FCAM plc shares at that date.
The value of the investment in F&C Funds, the FCAM plc share price and hence the ultimate number of FCAM plc shares to be settled is only known with certainty at the vesting date.
Any dividends paid by F&C Funds during the vesting period are re-invested in F&C Investment Funds.
94 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 25.
Share-based payments continued The awards meet the criteria of IFRS 2: Share-based Payment.
However, as the awards are ultimately settled in FCAM plc shares, it is not considered possible to reliably estimate the fair value of these awards at the grant date.
This is due to the number of market-based criteria which ultimately combine to determine the number and value of FCAM plc shares settled.
Settlement of these awards to employees is satisfied by the purchase of FCAM plc shares in the market.
The fair value of these awards at each year end has been determined by measurement of the equity instruments at intrinsic value, being the quoted price of the relevant F&C Funds, both at the grant date and at each subsequent reporting date.
The intrinsic value is then spread over the vesting period.
The value of the services provided is measured using the ultimate value of awards which vest.
All the remaining awards vested during 2012.
The underlying investments are held within an Employee Benefit Trust.

j Share Save Scheme The Share Save Scheme is an all-employee share scheme.
Participants are required to enter into a savings contract with a savings provider.
At the end of the savings period employees can elect to receive cash or exercise options.
The options granted entitle the holders to acquire Ordinary Shares at a price per Ordinary Share determined by the Directors prior to the issue of invitations.
The price at which options are offered cannot be less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an Ordinary Share at the date of grant.

k 2002 Executive Share Option Schemes 2002 ESOS IFRS 2: Share-based Payment is only applied to grants of shares, share options or other equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 and had not vested before 1 January 2005 i. e. the effective date of IFRS 2.
The 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme granted options before 7 November 2002 and was not therefore subject to the full effects of IFRS 2 in terms of recognising an expense in the Income Statement.
The standard does, however, require certain disclosures to be made in respect of this scheme.
All scheme options have now vested.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options expire.

The REIT parties have the right to require F&C to acquire all or part of their membership interests in F&C REIT at a valuation determined by an independent valuer, subject to an overall cap on F&Cs liability of 100.0m.
Ivor Smiths option is exercisable after the third anniversary of Completion and Leo Nos option is exercisable after the seventh anniversary of Completion.
While Kendray Properties Limited does not have any direct right to require F&C to acquire its holding in F&C REIT, under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, Kendray cannot hold a greater interest in F&C REIT than the aggregate of Leo Nos and Ivor Smiths interests or the holder of their beneficial interests and is therefore effectively required to transfer an element of its holding such that this requirement is achieved.
The consideration for such a transfer would be fair value.
Hence, in determining the gross liability of the option, Kendray Properties Limiteds entire holding in F&C REIT has been included.
The reduction in the fair value of the F&C REIT put option liabilities of 11.5m during 2012 2011: 8.7m reduction has been released to the Income Statement as detailed in note 6 b.
An external valuation of the F&C REIT business is performed at each reporting date to enable a fair value to be placed on the F&C REIT put option liabilities.
The average of three valuation methodologies equally weighted was used to place a fair value on the F&C REIT business, namely: 1.
Market earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA multiple 3.
Fixed EBITDA multiple The main assumptions used in the valuation methodologies are: a Projections of the profit and loss for F&C REIT: Net new business: Based on the F&C REIT approved budget for year one, with management forecast projections for the subsequent four years Revenue growth: 3.0% per annum Cost inflation: 3.5% per annum and 5.25% per annum for staff costs b Discount rates: 12.5% on recurring cash flows 25.0% on non-recurring cash flows c Perpetuity growth rates: 3.0% for recurring cash flows 3.0% for non-recurring cash flows d Earnings multipliers: 9.0 x recurring EBITDA 3.0 x non-recurring EBITDA ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 97 28.
Investment contract liabilities Investment contract liabilities in respect of policyholder investments at the start and end of the year and an analysis of movements during the year are as follows: 2012 2011 Note m m Liability as at 1 January 472.8 559.2 Contributions received 52.1 41.6 Investment return applied 3 40.6 13.7 Charges levied 1.5 1.9 Repayments 424.2 139.8 Movement in reinsurance ceded 2.9 Liability as at 31 December 136.9 472.8 All investment contract liabilities have been disclosed as current liabilities as this is considered to be appropriate to the rights of policyholders who may withdraw their investments at short notice.
As at 25 March 2013 the vast majority of the remaining investment contract liabilities have been settled, in accordance with the planned closure of the underlying investment product.
Insurance contract liabilities Insurance contract liabilities include life assurance liabilities in respect of lifetime guarantees provided with certain investment products, and annuity liabilities in respect of pension investment contracts where the investor has retired.
These liabilities and related reinsurance balances at the start and end of the year, together with an analysis of movements in the year, are as follows: 2012 2011 Gross Reinsurance Net Gross Reinsurance Net m m m m m m At 1 January 2.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 Claims paid 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 Change in economic assumptions 0.1 0.1 Unwinding of discount rate 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Transferred out during the year 1.9 1.9 At 31 December 2.0 2.0 The reinsurance liabilities related to annuity business reinsured with Friends Life Limited.
The liabilities and the associated assets were transferred to Friends Life Limited following Court Approval on 28 December 2012.
A liability adequacy test was carried out at policy level and resulted in no additional provision for either 2012 or 2011.
No significant gain or loss arose on reinsurance contracts incepted in 2012 or 2011.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used in determining the insurance contract liabilities and the reinsurers share of these liabilities, and the process adopted to arrive at these assumptions are as follows: Mortality rates 2012 2011 Annuities in payment n a Males: 97% FCMA00: n a Females: 92% FCFA00 Due to the small number of annuity policies, the mortality assumptions reflected recent experience of the reinsurer together with an allowance for future mortality improvement.
Experience analysis for mortality was performed annually by the reinsurer.
Discount rate The discount rate used at 31 December 2011 was 4.02% based on fixed interest gross redemption yields, with an adjustment for risk.

Nature and purpose of reserves: Share premium account The share premium account is used to record the issue of share capital in excess of par value.
Capital redemption reserve The Capital redemption reserve is used to maintain the capital of the Company when shares are bought back and subsequently cancelled without Court Approval.
Merger reserve The merger reserve is used to record share premium on shares issued by way of consideration in respect of acquisitions.
The element of the merger reserve which relates to amortisation and impairment of intangible assets charged to the Income Statement is considered to be realised.
A transfer is made from the merger reserve to retained earnings to recognise the extent to which the merger reserve has been realised, thereby offsetting the corresponding element of the intangible amortisation and any impairment charge.

ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 101 35.
Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to a number of business risks.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Groups risk management arrangements, but has delegated the implementation and operation of the Board policies to management.
The Groups risk management policies and the risk management framework for identifying, monitoring and managing risks across the Group, including strategic and operational risks, are outlined in the Directors Report on Corporate Governance on page 31 and the key risks facing the Group, together with actions taken to mitigate these risks are outlined on pages 10 and 11 of the Business Review.
The Directors consider it appropriate to differentiate between those financial risks which directly impact the Group and those which indirectly impact the Group due to the risks borne by our clients and the consequential impact on the Groups assets under management and revenues.
The Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial instruments arises from the following financial risks: Credit risk Liquidity risk Market risk, which comprises: Market price risk Foreign currency risk Interest rate risk This note presents information on the Groups direct or indirect exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
Note 36 provides numerical analysis of the Groups financial instrument exposure to such risks, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at the reporting date.
Indirect earnings risk through client assets As an active fund manager, the Group is responsible for managing assets in accordance with the mandates specified by our clients.
The assets managed by the Group are, to varying degrees, subject to the financial risks outlined above.
While these risks could result in financial loss or gain through a change in asset value, these risks and rewards are fully borne by, or fall to the benefit of, our clients.
However, as the majority of the Groups revenues are quantified as a percentage of assets under management generally on a quarterly, monthly or daily basis, the Groups income is impacted by movements in client assets which are caused by the exposure to financial risks.
As a result of the direct link of revenues to the value of client assets, the Groups interests are aligned to those of our clients.
A key risk to our business is that of poor investment performance, which could lead to the subsequent loss of client mandates.
A key role of the heads of F&Cs investment functions is to monitor the fund performance achieved by our investment professionals.
Where it is considered necessary, actions are taken to change process or personnel with a view to attaining top quartile performance.
The Group has the ability to earn performance fees from a number of our clients based on absolute performance or where out-performance of the benchmark or set objective is achieved.
These arrangements reinforce the alignment of the Groups interests with those of our clients.
Direct earnings and capital exposure The Group has direct exposure to the following risks in respect of financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position: Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument is unable to pay, in full, amounts when due, and arises principally from the Groups cash and cash equivalents and trade debtors and accrued income.
Liquidity risk is the risk of the Group failing to maintain adequate levels of financial resources to enable it to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, or can only do so at a significantly increased cost.
Market price risk the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will change due to movements in market prices, other than foreign exchange rates or interest rates.
Foreign currency risk the Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from the Sterling value of cash flows arising from transactions denominated in a foreign currency.
In addition, foreign currency risk arises from translating balances denominated in a currency other than Sterling and therefore the Sterling value of those balances could vary adversely.
Interest rate risk the Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through the variable-rate interest received on cash deposits and through borrowing at fixed and floating rates.
A fuller analysis follows of the financial risks associated with the Groups financial instruments, together with the objectives, policies and processes to manage the Groups exposure to those risks.
102 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 35.
Financial risk management continued Unit-linked assets and liabilities A significant element of the value of the Groups financial assets relates to the Groups unit-linked pooled pension entity, F&C Managed Pension Funds Limited F&C MPF.
As outlined in note 17 a i 1, Financial Instruments, the risks and rewards associated with these assets, which are held by F&C MPF, fall to be borne by, or to the benefit of, the underlying policyholders.
As a result, the investment contract liabilities included in the Statement of Financial Position are equal and opposite in value to the assets which are held on behalf of unit-linked policyholders.
The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations in the value of the assets arising from changes in market prices or credit default, although the revenue stream earned from managing these assets varies in line with the movement in assets held on behalf of clients.
The financial risk management disclosures therefore specifically exclude policyholders unit-linked assets and liabilities relating to F&C MPF as there is no direct exposure to the Group from the associated financial instruments.
Financial investments Recognising that the Groups revenue stream has significant financial exposure to fluctuations in assets managed on behalf of clients, a key principle of the Group Treasury Policy set by the Board is to restrict investment of the Groups assets to low risk deposits or money market instruments where the risk of capital loss is low, thereby seeking to protect the Groups capital.
Advance Board approval is required for any investment or financial instrument which does not follow this general principle.
Financial investments classified as available for sale, as detailed in note 14, primarily reflect the value of certain of the Groups legacy private equity investments.
These represent carried interest entitlement which arises from the Groups historical ownership of private equity businesses.
The Board does not seek to manage any of the financial risks associated with these investments and recognises that uncertainty exists as to the quantum and timing of future distributions which may arise from these investments.
Other financial investments, classified as fair value through profit or loss, as detailed in note 17 a i 2, primarily comprise assets held in connection with current or historic employee remuneration arrangements.
The Group has no net financial exposure to TRC Employee Benefits assets as the risks and rewards of all movements in the value of these financial assets fall to the beneficiary and are offset by equal and opposite movements in the Groups associated employee benefit liabilities.
The NIC hedge economically hedges the Groups exposure to movements in future national insurance contributions obligations in respect of legacy employee share plans.
Stock of units and shares The Group operates and manages a number of OEICs whose funds, into which retail and institutional investors can invest, have a wide range of investment objectives.
The Group holds a stock of units and shares in these OEIC funds in order to facilitate the creation and redemption of units by investors.
The Groups risk management policy limits the aggregate value of the units held by the Group to 2.25m, thereby capping the maximum financial risk exposure associated with these assets.
Trade debtors and accrued income Trade debtors and accrued income represent amounts recognised within net revenue in the Income Statement, but which have not been settled in cash.
The nature of F&Cs business is such that asset management fees accrue based on daily, month-end or quarter-end asset values which, once known, are billed to clients and are due to be settled in line with individual contractual terms.
As a result, the aggregate value of debtors and accrued income can typically represent up to four months of revenue at any point in time.
Before the Group takes on new clients, it undertakes the required Know Your Client procedures.
As the Group manages assets on behalf of clients and management fees are typically charged to and paid from the underlying funds managed by the Group, there is a relatively low risk of default on management fees.
The Group does not hold any credit insurance.
Due to the scale of some of F&Cs larger clients, the Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk from large clients or groups of connected clients, arising from the timing difference between the recognition of income and the receipt of management fees outlined above.
Very few clients have an external credit rating.
Where management fees are denominated in a currency other than Sterling, the Group is exposed to currency risk.
The Board recognises that the Group has significant exposure to Euro-denominated cash flows, but at this point in time has not chosen not to enter into any medium or long-term forward exchange contracts.
OEIC and unit trust debtors OEIC and unit trust debtors include trustee debtors and debtors due from investors in respect of the purchase of units and shares in open-ended funds.
Typically, the Group recognises OEIC and unit trust creditors of a similar magnitude at any point in time.
In operating and managing OEICs, the Group seeks to match the purchase and sale of investments to align to the receipt or payment of funds from or to investors.
However, if these obligations are not matched then there is a requirement for the Group to fund any shortfall from its corporate cash resources.
The risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved.
In the event that investors default on sums due, then the Group is entitled to reimbursement of costs from the investor.
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2012 | 103 35.
Financial risk management continued Cash and cash equivalents F&C adopts a low risk approach to treasury management and seeks to ensure that its capital is preserved and financial risks are managed appropriately.
The Group treasury operations are managed by the Finance function within parameters defined by the Board.
The regulatory capital and treasury positions of the Group are reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The Groups cash and cash equivalent assets are exposed to a number of financial risks in the normal course of its business.
The policy adopted is designed to manage risk and recognises that treasury management operations are specifically not treated as a profit centre.
The key aspects of this policy and its implementation are detailed below: Funds on deposit will only be placed on a short-term basis maximum term 90 days to help maximise regulatory capital and limit any liquidity risk.
Deposits may only be placed with counterparties approved by the Group Credit and Counterparty Approval Committee, and the Board has set a 25.0m limit for the maximum exposure to any single counterparty.
The Committees primary focus is to assess the credit position of counterparties prior to placing any assets with them and to monitor credit risk thereafter.
Exposure to cash and cash equivalent balances held in foreign currency is managed to reduce the risk of movements in exchange rates, where possible, by the repatriation of surplus foreign currency into Sterling.
This is achieved in practice via the regular settlement of the Groups transfer pricing arrangements and through the payment of dividends from foreign subsidiaries, having regard to any restrictions in respect of their respective legal, regulatory and working capital requirements.
Cash and deposit balances can be exposed to interest rate movements.
The Group utilises the experience and skills of its professional dealing team to obtain the best interest rates, ensuring the expected maturity dates of deposits are aligned to the Groups working capital requirements.
Any exception to the treasury policy requires the prior approval of the Board.
Defined benefit pension deficit The Groups defined benefit pension deficit represents the discounted value of future pension obligations in excess of plan assets, details of which are given in note 24.
The Group has exposure to movements in the market value of the plan assets, which are held across a number of asset classes.
The value of defined benefit pension obligations is quantified and discounted using corporate bond rates.
Movements in these rates can have a significant impact on the pension liabilities and hence the quantum of the Groups pension deficit.
Details of the asset and liability risk management framework in respect of the Groups primary defined benefit pension plan are given on page 85.
Management of capital The Companys Ordinary Shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Board monitors significant movements in the composition of its shareholder base.
Details of substantial interests in share capital are shown in the Report of the Directors on page 23.
In the ordinary course of business the only movements in the absolute number of shares in issue would be through the issue of shares to satisfy obligations under share-based payment arrangements.
The Directors give careful consideration to the appropriate funding structure for financing all acquisitions, which historically have included both equity and debt-funded transactions.
During 2012 some 10.7 million new shares were issued in respect of TRC Commutation arrangements.
Dividends are only declared by the Board after due consideration of a number of key items, including the financial results and the outlook of the financial position of the Company and of the Group.
Specifically, as part of the 2011 Strategic Review, the Board has sought to improve dividend cover and to repurchase debt from cash generation.
Cognisant of these matters, the Board declared a total dividend of 3.0 pence per share for 2012.
The overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity over the short and medium-term to meet the needs of the business.
This includes liquidity to cover, among other things, capital expenditure, servicing debt and equity capital as well as working capital to fund the Groups day-to-day operational requirements.
Working capital Working capital is monitored on a daily basis to ensure that settlement terms of all forthcoming liabilities can be met.
This activity includes timely collection of debtors and monitoring of cash on deposit, having regard to regulatory capital requirements, as outlined below.
The Groups Finance function includes a Treasury team which manages the cash flow requirements of the Group while seeking to maximise the amount of cash on deposit.
At 31 December 2012 the Group had a 20m revolving credit facility and bank overdraft facilities available to it which provided some protection against any short-term cash-flow deficiencies.
The undrawn committed facilities available at the reporting date are shown in note 21, as are details of the Groups interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
104 | FINANCIAL STATEMENTS | Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 35.
Financial risk management continued At 31 December 2012, the Group had some 142m of Guaranteed Fixed Rate Loan Notes which mature in December 2016 together with some 116m of Fixed Floating Rate Subordinated Notes in issue.
The earliest repayment date for these Subordinated Notes is 2016, but this can be extended at the option of the Group to 2026.
In addition, the Group has the option to defer interest payments on this subordinated debt, but if it elects to do so then no dividend can be paid to Ordinary Shareholders until the cumulative amount of any unpaid interest due on the subordinated debt is settled in full.
No such interest payments have been deferred.
The Board Reserved List prohibits the use of derivatives including futures, options and forward contracts, in respect of the Groups net assets, without prior Board approval, recognising the general principle of seeking to minimise capital loss.
Regulatory capital requirements The Group is required to maintain a minimum level of capital in accordance with the Capital Requirements Directive CRD prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
The Group has a waiver, granted by the FSA, from meeting any minimum capital requirements under the consolidated supervision rules of the CRD.
This waiver expires in April 2016.
At 31 December 2012, there were 14 regulated companies in the Group, of which 10 are registered in the United Kingdom and are subject to regulation by the FSA.
This includes F&C MPF which, being a regulated insurance firm, as opposed to an investment firm, is not part of the consolidation Group for regulatory capital reporting purposes.
Overseas regulated companies, registered in the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Hong Kong are subject to regulatory capital requirements set out by their respective local regulatory authority, as embedded within the legislation of those jurisdictions.
Regulations set out the measurement of Capital Resources and Capital Resources Requirements CRR to determine the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
This CRR is referred to as the Pillar 1 capital requirements under CRD.
For the UK-regulated investment firms, the CRR is the higher of: the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement: and the fixed overhead requirement.
Credit risk represents the risk of a party being unable to meet its obligations to a firm and is calculated using risk weighted percentages applied to the various exposure amounts.
The market risk for F&C represents the risk of loss from fluctuations in exchange rates and is calculated as a percentage of the total of the long or short positions, denominated in foreign currencies, whichever is the greater.
The fixed overhead requirement is calculated as a quarter of a firms relevant fixed annual expenditure in the previous years audited Financial Statements.
The regulated companies are required to submit financial returns to the FSA, or the local regulatory authority for overseas companies, setting out the calculation of the regulatory capital surplus or deficit.
The Groups regulated companies are required to submit financial returns monthly, quarterly or semi-annually and the Group must submit a consolidated return semi-annually.
The CRD requires the Group to conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, referred to as Pillar 2 capital requirements.
The objective of this process is to ensure that companies have adequate capital to enable them to manage risks not deemed to be adequately covered under the Pillar 1 minimum requirements.
This is a forward-looking exercise which includes stress-testing key risks, considering how the company would cope with a significant market downturn for example, and an assessment of the Groups ability to mitigate the risks.
All of the Groups regulated entities maintained surpluses of regulatory capital throughout 2011 and 2012.

The extent of risks arising from financial instruments Note 35 presents details of the Groups direct or indirect exposure to financial risks arising from financial instruments and the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the management of the Groups capital.
This note provides numerical analyses of the Groups direct exposure to such financial risk, including relevant sensitivity analysis, at each reporting date.
The disclosures in this note exclude any policyholder unit-linked assets and liabilities in respect of F&C MPF, as the risks and rewards rest primarily with the policyholders.
a Credit risk i Maximum exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The maximum exposure of each class of financial asset is: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 4.0 6.6 Stock of units and shares 0.3 0.9 Available for sale financial assets: Financial investments 1.3 1.7 Loans and receivables: Trade debtors 32.0 13.3 Accrued income 30.6 29.0 OEIC and unit trust debtors 10.6 29.5 Other debtors 5.2 4.8 Amounts owed by TRC related party entities 0.7 0.6 Amounts owned by F&C REIT related party entities 0.1 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents shareholders 160.7 196.9 245.5 283.4 The accrued income balance is higher than the average monthly balance during the year.
This is primarily due to the level of performance fees recognised at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011.
The quantum of OEIC and unit trust debtors fluctuates significantly during the year: the balance is dependent upon the timing and values of creations and liquidations of units or shares.

The extent of risks arising from financial instruments continued The quantum of OEIC and unit trust creditors fluctuates significantly during the year: the balance is dependent upon the timing and values of creations and liquidations of units or shares.
The maturity dates of the Groups financial liabilities have been determined by reference to the earliest contractual date on which the counterparty could demand payment and the stated amounts represent undiscounted cash flows.
Other financial liabilities comprise the F&C REIT put options, included at the earliest date at which the options could be exercised.
The Group has borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 December 2012 and 31 December 2011 are shown in note 21. c Market risks i Market price risk The analysis of financial assets which are exposed to market price risk is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: Financial investments 1.7 5.4 Stock of units and shares 0.3 0.9 2.0 6.3 Details of the assets held by the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, which are also exposed to market price risk, are given in note 24. ii Other price risk 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Available for sale financial assets: Financial investments 1.3 1.7 iii Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk at the reporting date in respect of: Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies: and Net assets of foreign operations.

This analysis measures the change in fair value of the Groups financial instruments.
The sensitivity analysis, which is for illustrative purposes only, is prepared based on financial instruments at the reporting dates.
The sensitivity assumes changes in certain market conditions.
These assumptions may differ materially from the actual outturn due to the inherent uncertainties in global financial markets.
In practice, market risks rarely change in isolation and are likely to be interdependent.
The methods and assumptions used are the same for both reporting periods.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on the impact that a set percentage increase or decrease in the market conditions would have on the profit or loss and on total equity.
Changes in exchange rates assume an instantaneous increase or decrease of 10.0% in foreign currency to Sterling rates at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
The estimated changes in fair values of investments assume a 10.0% increase or decrease in the fair values of investments at the reporting date, with all other variables remaining constant.
Changes in market interest rates assume an increase or decrease of 1.0% in the rate applied to average cash balances in the year.

In addition, the F&C REIT put options are disclosed in note 27 at fair value.
A 10% movement in the fair value of the options at 31 December 2012 would result in a 3.4m 31 December 2011: 4.5m charge or credit to the Income Statement and to equity.
Impairment of financial assets can also be affected by changes in the relevant underlying risk.
d Capital A summary of the Groups capital and the net assets which it represents is shown below: 31 December 31 December 2012 2011 m m Share capital 0.6 0.5 Share premium account 58.9 51.8 Capital redemption reserve 0.8 0.8 Merger reserve 336.8 359.7 Other reserves 25.7 22.8 Retained earnings 162.7 154.3 Non-controlling interests 12.1 12.5 Total equity 546.2 556.8 Net assets 546.2 556.8 Note 35 describes the Groups management of capital, working capital and regulatory capital requirements.
Insurance risk management The Groups insurance contracts were all annuity contracts which guaranteed payment during the lifetime of the annuitant at a specified level or with a specified escalation factor.
They were all 100% reinsured with Friends Life Limited.
The insurance contracts were all transferred to Friends Life Limited in 2012.
The only risk that the Group was subject to in respect of these contracts was the credit risk of the reinsurer.
Given the small amount at risk nil at 31 December 2012: 2.0m at 31 December 2011, this was not considered to be significant.
