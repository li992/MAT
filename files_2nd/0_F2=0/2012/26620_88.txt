Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, products structuring and distribution means that operating costs are not allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, and distribution costs to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.
