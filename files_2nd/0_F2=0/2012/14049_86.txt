Section 5 | Financial statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 29.
Financial risk management continued 29 d Foreign exchange risk i Transactional It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts to x the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash ows.
At 31 December 2012, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, rm commitments or probable forecast transactions.
ii Translational Where possible the Group will raise external funding to match the currency prole of its foreign operations, and mitigate translation exposure.
If match funding is not possible then currency derivatives are also used to protect against movements in foreign exchange.
iii Hedge accounting For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classied as either fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Page 127 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The hedge accounting relationships as at 31 December 2012 were as follows: Cash ow hedges At 31 December 2012, the Group held two cross currency swaps designated as cash ow hedges against the 2003 US Dollar private placement.
Fixed interest cash ows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for xed interest cash ows denominated in Sterling.
The prole of these cross currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: Notional Receivable USD Payable GBP Notional Receivable USD Payable GBP amount interest rate interest rate amount interest rate interest rate 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 Maturity USD m % % USD m % % August 2015 21.0 5.7 5.7 32.0 5.7 5.7 August 2015 12.0 5.7 5.7 18.3 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash ow hedges.
The net notional amounts are summarised by currency below: 2012 2011 m m Sterling 176.3 235.1 US Dollar 47.2 131.0 Euro 9.5 0.8 Indian Rupee 190.7 337.0 Other 10.0 All currency derivatives designated as cash ow hedges are highly effective and as at 31 December 2012 a fair value loss of 33.8m 2011: 35.7m loss has been deferred in the hedging reserve.
The net fair value loss recognised on cash ow hedges during the year was 2.1m 2011: 35.7m loss, whilst net losses of 10.1m were reclassied to the consolidated income statement.
iv Currency sensitivity The Groups currency exposures that result in net currency gains and losses in the income statement and equity arise principally from movement in US Dollar and Indian Rupee exchange rates.
At 31 December 2012, if both had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.6m higher 2011: 0.2m lower and equity would have been 2.0m higher 2011: 1.4m higher.
