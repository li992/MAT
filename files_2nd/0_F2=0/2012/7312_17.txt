We continue to support open and constructive dialogue with all of DEVELOPMENTS IN 2012 I reported in our 2011 Annual Report that our governance focus in our shareholders on governance, strategy and executive remuneration and welcome any feedback.
2012 would be on two main areas in particular.
These were executive remuneration and the development of our approach to managing risk.
I can report good progress in both these areas.

We will continue to review our narrative reporting to ensure it meets new developments and best practice.
OUR FOCUS FOR 2013 The UK government has recently introduced proposals in respect of reporting on executive remuneration which will come into force on 1 October 2013.
The Remuneration Committee will be considering these requirements with the aimof providing greater transparencyto shareholders.
As well as developing remuneration reporting, the Board will be considering UK government proposals to amend narrative reporting requirements for company annual reports.
These proposals will require companies to produce a Strategic Report whichreplaces the Business Review.
We believe that our reporting in this respect is already well developed, but we will continue to review our narrative reporting to ensure it meets new developments and best practice.
