Certain Directors had interest bearing loans to settle tax liabilities arising as a result of a share gift given in December 2008 by CPW.
These were forgiven in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Share-based payments Accounting policy The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal, non-market, performance criteria for example, EPS targets and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those with external, market, performance criteria for example, TSR targets.
For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to vesting.
If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately.
If a scheme is forfeited, nofurther expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised is reversed.
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 42 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5.
Share-based payments continued Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long-term incentives plans.
To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable: the cost of such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans.
Charges are also recognised on loans provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities, to the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable: the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.
Where loans are granted for the purchase of shares under a LTIP, interest is charged on these loans.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based payment no cost has been recognised in respect of the options granted before November 2002.
Group share schemes The Groups share schemes are the Discretionary Share Option Plan DSOP and Save-As-You-Earn scheme SAYE.
In addition, the Group has a number of legacy Carphone Warehouse Group schemes.
In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes and legacy CPW schemes has been presented.
This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of 1.36 2011: 1.38.
For the CPW legacy schemes, with no IFRS 2 charge in current or prior year, the disclosures are limited to the dilutive effect on EPS and the number of options outstanding at the end of the year.

iv TTG VES and CPW TTG VES The TTG VES enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted as relevant for changes in invested capital since that date.
The incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7% on this invested capital.
The Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase A shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating business.
The CPW TTG VES enables participants to share in 2.24% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted for the change in the Groups opening share price since 1 April 2009.
In line with the TTG VES, the invested capital is adjusted for changes in invested capital since 1 April 2009 and the incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7%.
The Groups opening share price for this purpose represents an allocation of the share price of CPW at that rate, based on the market capitalisation of the Group and Carphone Warehouse Group PLC in the 5 days following demerger.
CPW advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase C shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Groups operating businesses.
The Group has an obligation to acquire the A and C shares if performance conditions are met, to provide to participants the share of value described above.
These performance conditions are measured over an initial performance period to September 2012, at which point participants have a put option over 60% of their shares, and a subsequent performance period to September 2013, at which point participants have a put option over the remainder of their shares.
If the performance criteria are not met, the A and C shares will have no value.
The fair value of the schemes, which has performance targets based on the growth of the market capitalisation of the Group, was estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to initially value the A shares and then a Black Scholes model to calculate the option value.
The model combines the valuation price of a share at the date of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the expected value of the Group at the date of grant discounted for the lack of marketability of the shares.
The following assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo model for the A shares awarded in the year: volatility of 22%: a risk free rate ranging from 0.5% to 2.7%: and a dividend yield of between 0% and 5% in each of the three years to September 2013.
The following assumptions were used in the Black Scholes model for the A shares awarded in the year: equity volatility of 149.9% and 139.0% for September 2012 and September 2013 options respectively: a risk free rate of 1.9% and 2.3% for September 2012 and September 2013 options respectively: and a dividend yield of nil.
No C shares were awarded in the year.

This will be amortised over the expected life of the loan and is included within facility fees and similar charges above.
Taxation Accounting policy Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits.
Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

The tax credit on Statutory earnings for the year ended 31 March 2012 is 11m 2011: 22m charge.
The reconciliation between the Headline and Statutory tax charge is shown in note 9.
In the prior year there was a reclassication of 18m from current tax to deferred tax to better reect expected utilisation of losses.

During the year a reduction in the UK Statutory rate of corporation tax was enacted bringing the rate down from 26%to24%.
Accordingly the tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2012 take account of this change.
This has resulted in atax chargeto the Income statement as the value of the Groups tax assets has been reduced.
The Government intends to enact furtherreductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year, down to 23% effective from 1 April 2013 and to 22% by 1 April 2014.
As these tax rates were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, the rate reduction is not reected in these financial statements in accordance with IAS10 Events after the Reporting Period, as it is a non-adjusting event occurring after the reporting period.
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 47 During the year the Group reached agreement with HMRC over the utilisation of brought forward losses acquired with the Tiscali UK business in 2009, including those of Video Networks Limited.
This has resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of 45m, in addition to those that were recognised at the acquisition date.
The associated tax credit has been treated as an exceptional item in the income statement note 9.
At 31 March 2012, the Group had unused tax losses of 873m 2011: 1,016m available for offset against future taxable profits.
Adeferred tax asset of 56m 2011: 45m has been recognised in respect of 232m 2011: 173m of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 641m 2011: 843m as there is insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
Dividends Accounting policy Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received.
Final dividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.
The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders: 2012 2011 m m Ordinary dividends Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 of 1.7p per ordinary share 15 Final dividend for the period ended 31 March 2011 of 3.9p per ordinary share 35 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 of 2.6p per ordinary share 23 Total ordinary dividends 58 15 The final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 is 6.4p per ordinary share on approximately 873 million shares 56m, which was approved by the Board on 16 May 2012 and has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2012.
The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reected in the analysis above.
Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information Accounting policy Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.

Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information continued a Operating efficiencies Phase I Back ofce restructuring On 26 January 2011 a major restructure of the Group was announced to integrate technology and IT capabilities and consolidate back ofce functions.
The reorganisation principally resulted in a reduction in headcount, and required project management and consulting costs to deliver these benets.
The programme also resulted in onerous contract and dual running costs relating to a number of technology contracts where, services previously provided externally are now being provided in-house.
A credit of 1m has been recognised in the year in respect of accruals relating to property costs which are no longer required.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2012 was 11m 2011: 12m.
A total taxation credit of 3m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: 3m.
b Operating efficiencies Phase II Contact centre rationalisation On 7 September 2011, the Group announced the consolidation of the Groups contact centre operations, which has resulted in redundancy, consultancy and onerous property lease costs, principally in relation to the closure of the Groups contact centre in Waterford, Ireland.
The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2012 was 14m 2011: nil.
A total taxation credit of 3m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: nil.
c Ofcom ne During the year Ofcom ned the Group 3m as a result of contravention of General Condition 11 under section 94 of The Communication Act 2003.
No tax credit has been recognised in respect of the ne.
d One Company integration The One Company integration was implemented during the year ended 31 March 2010 following the acquisition of Tiscali UK on 3 July 2009.
The Group revisited its overall operating structure in order to both integrate the Tiscali business and deliver efficiencies in existing operations.
The programme has generated significant synergies, through the elimination of duplicated costs and migration of customers onto the Groups unbundled network and is largely complete.
A credit of 1m was recognised in the year in respect of a provision release for costs no longer anticipated to be incurred.
In the prior year operating reorganisation costs of 40m were incurred, principally comprising redundancies and site closures, an integration project team and consulting costs and costs of 7m were incurred in respect of redundant software and xed asset write-downs.
A total taxation credit of nil in year ended 31 March 2012 2011: 10m.
A credit of 4m was recognised in respect of recycling of translation reserves in the year ended 31 March 2011 in relation to legal entities, which were liquidated.
No taxation has been recognised in respect of this credit.
e Amortisation of acquisition intangibles An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of 61m was incurred in the year 2011: 62m.
A tax credit at 26% 2011:28% has been recognised in respect of the amortisation of acquisition intangibles, net of any adjustments in respect of prior periods: this was 16m for the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: 17m.
f Exceptional items taxation During the year ended 31 March 2012 the Group reached agreement with HMRC over the utilisation of brought forward tax losses acquired with the Tiscali UK business in 2009, including those of Video Networks Limited.
This has resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets of 45m, in addition to those recognised at the acquisition date.
The recognition of the deferred tax asset has been recognised in exceptional items as it is both material and one-off in nature, and does not relate to the underlying performance of the business.

Goodwill and other intangible assets a Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The Group has two CGUs Consumer and TalkTalk Business.
For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash ows that those shared costs support.
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 50 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 11.
Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired: this review is performed at a CGU level.
Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash ows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates.
The future cash ows of the Group are taken from the Board or Management approved three year plan and extrapolated out for the following 17 years based on the UKs long-term growth rate.
This is discounted by the CGUs weighted average cost of capital to give the net present value of that CGU.
Where the net present value of future cash ows is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the segment pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.
2012 2011 m m Opening cost and net book value 471 470 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 13 9 3 Disposals note 13 2 Closing cost and net book value 480 471 The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Consumer 337 337 TalkTalk Business 143 134 480 471 Impairment review The key assumptions used in the Groups goodwill impairment review are as follows: Long-term growth rates Long-term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the OECD.
The rate applied in the current year was 1.8% 2011: 1.8%.
Discount rate The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten-year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk of the CGU.
The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash ows is 8.2% 2011: 9.1%.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs discount rate are benchmarked to externally available data.
The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the similarity of risk factors and geographical location.
Capital expenditure Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate of expenditure.
Customer factors The key assumptions for the forecast cash ows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs, including acquisition costs and change in product mix.
The value assigned to each of these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external information on expected trends of future market developments.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identied any reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 51 b Other intangible assets Accounting policy Operating intangibles: Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for internal use.
Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identied, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benets, and the development cost can be measured reliably.
Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.
Acquisition intangibles: Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six years on a straight-line basis.
The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash ows after a deduction for contributory assets.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy Impairment At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
The Groups shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash ows.
Determining whether the carrying amount of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement.
If an indication of impairment is identied, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash ows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, to use to calculate present values.
Useful economic lives The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected.
This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Impairment of assets The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date.
Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the assets recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.

Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straightline basis over its expected useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows: Short leasehold costs 10% or the lease term if less than ten years Network equipment and computer hardware 12.5 50% per annum Fixtures and ttings 20 25% per annum Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policy The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement.

Non-current asset investments Accounting policy Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given plus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.
Investments are categorised as available-for-sale and are then recorded at fair value.
Changes in fair value, together with any related taxation, are taken directly to equity, and recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold or determined to be impaired.
m Cost and net book value at 1 April 2010, 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2012 1 Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2012 and at 31 March 2011 relate to a 8.4% 2011: 11.3% interest in Shared Band Limited, a telecommunications technology provider.
The Group holds a strategic, non-controlling interest.
These shares are not held for trading and accordingly are classied as available for sale.
The fair value of the shares is based on cost less any provision for impairment, as the shares are not listed on an exchange, and therefore a market price cannot be reliably measured.
This fair value measurement is classied as level three, derived from valuation techniques using data that are not based on observable market data.
a Principal investments The Parent Company has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the profits or losses or net assets of the Group.

b Acquisitions and disposals i Acquisitions The Group acquired Executel Limited and Greystone Telecom Limited for cash consideration net of cash acquired of 15m, which resulted in acquisition intangibles of 8m, goodwill of 9m and the corresponding deferred tax liability of 2m.
The impact of these acquisitions on the results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2012 had the business been acquired on 31 March 2011, is immaterial.
The goodwill of 9m was recognised relating to the future opportunities arising from the nature of the businesses and t with the Groups existing operations.
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 56 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13.
Non-current asset investments continued The Group paid cash consideration of 1m in respect of deferred consideration for TalkTalk Business 2CCH Limited and Southern Communications Limited and dealer buyouts.
The acquisition of dealer buyouts resulted in acquisition intangibles of 1m.
In the year ended 31 March 2011: The Group agreed a net adjustment in respect of working capital and customer numbers with Tiscali S. p. A. in respect of the Groups acquisition on Tiscali UK on 3 July 2009.
This resulted in an adjustment to goodwill of 14m.
The Group acquired TalkTalk Business 2CCH Limited and Southern Communications Limited for cash consideration net of cash acquired of 2m and deferred consideration of 2m, which resulted in acquisition intangibles of 2m and goodwill of 3m.
The impact of these acquisitions on the results of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2011 had the businesses been acquired on 31 March 2010, is immaterial.
The Group has recognised a gain of 1m within its income statement in respect of the increase in fair value of the equity interest held in Opal 2CCH Limited at the acquisition date.
The goodwill of 3m was recognised relating to the future opportunities arising from the nature of the businesses and t with the Groups existing operations.
The Group paid cash consideration of 1m in respect of V Networks Limited deferred consideration and dealer buyouts which resulted in goodwill and acquisition intangibles of 1m.
ii Disposals On 5 July 2011, Group disposed of its Valuecall operations for cash consideration of 3m.
There was no associated goodwill or acquisition intangibles in respect of this business, resulting in a 3m profit on disposal.
In the year ended 31 March 2011 the Group entered into an agreement to sell its operations in Ireland for a consideration of 4m.
The profit on sale of the business was offset by the impairment of goodwill recognised on the acquisition of Tele2 Ireland in 2006 of 2m and closure costs for the business of 2m, resulting in nil profit or loss on disposal.
Interest in joint venture Accounting policy Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The Group income statement includes the Groups share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the year.
In the Group balance sheet, the Groups interest in joint ventures are shown as a non-current asset in the balance sheet, representing the Groups investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for any impairment.
When a joint venture has net liabilities, any loans advanced to the venture are included in the Groups equity accounted investment in it.
When a venture has net assets, any loans advanced to it are shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to the Group.
The Group holds 14.3% of the ordinary share capital of YouView TV Limited, a joint venture with The British Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC, Channel Four Television Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited.

Bank overdrafts: Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management: these uncommitted facilities bear interest at a margin over the Bank of England base rate.
100m term loan: The Group has a committed Term Loan of 100m, 25m matures in March 2013, 25m matures in March 2014 and the remainder matures in March 2015.
The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period.
The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
Covenants included in this facility restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover and xed charges interest and operating lease expenditure cover.

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2012 Overview Performance review Governance Financial statements Other information 61 a Financial instruments continued The Group has cash ow hedges in place that swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from oating to xed.
These hedges have been fully effective from inception.
The fair value measurement is classied as level two, derived from other observable market data: this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2012 is nil 2011: nil.
An expense of nil 2011: nil has been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2012.
As the hedges were fully effective there has been no income statement impact.
b Embedded derivatives No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identied and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
c Foreign exchange risk The Group uses spot foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US dollar.
In the prior year the Group also used short term currency swaps for liquidity management.
At 31 March 2012, the sterling value of outstanding currency contracts was 2m 2011: 23m.
Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates: this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison to year end rates adjusted for funding to related parties and assuming all other variables remain constant as follows: 2012 2011 m m 10% movement in the UK sterling Euro exchange rate Income statement movement 2 Other equity movement The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows: UK Sterling Euro Total m m m 2012 Borrowings before derivatives 436 436 Derivative 2 2 434 2 436 UK Sterling Euro Total m m m 2011 Borrowings before derivatives 439 439 Derivative 23 23 416 23 439 During the year the Group used derivatives for management of foreign currency cash balances held by overseas subsidiaries which were inherited from CPW on demerger.
d Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at oating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash ow interest rate risk.
These oating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency.
Future cash ows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover.
As detailed in section a the Group has cash ow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated.
Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating these sensitivities.
This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year end positions prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of uctuations in levels of borrowings.
