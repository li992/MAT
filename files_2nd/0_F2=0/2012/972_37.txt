ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PLATINUM GROUP METALS estimates as at 31 December 2012 PLATINUM The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in compliance with The South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009.
Operations and Projects outside South Africa were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Details of the individual operations appear in Anglo American Platinums Annual Report.
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable cut appropriate to the speci c reef.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo American Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.
The Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve tables re ect estimates prior to the strategic announcement in January 2013.
Changes associated with the strategic review will most probably result in a reallocation of reported Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources in the Rustenburg and Union areas and the impact thereof will only be re ected in the 2013 Annual Report.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo American Platinum Limited is 79.9%.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. The reported grades are as delivered for treatment.
Concentrator recoveries for Merensky Reef range from 84% to 89%, UG2 Reef from 82% to 87%, Platreef from 64% to 74% and Main Sulphide Zone from 70% to 78%.
3 Contained Metal: Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2013 Business plan prior to the strategic review announcement made in January 2013.
The pay limit is based on Cost 4, which consists of Direct Cash Cost on and off mine, Other Indirect Costs and Stay in Business Capital on and off mine.
The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 2.0g t and 5.6g t 4E PGE.
The range is a function of various factors including depth of the ore body, geological complexity, infrastructure and economic parameters.
5 Merensky Reef: The global Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content decreased, mainly in response to economic assumptions resulting in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources at Tumela Mine and Siphumelele 1 Mine.
These decreases were partially offset by the increase in Ore Reserves mainly from Khuseleka Mine and Union South Mine where additional Mineral Resources have been converted to Ore Reserves.
The global Ore Reserve grade decreased following the increase of the minimum resource cut from 90cm to 110cm due to improved rock support measures.
6 UG2 Reef: The global Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content decreased largely due to economic assumptions and the resulting reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources at Tumela Mine, Twickenham Mine and Siphumelele 2 Mine.
These decreases were partially offset by the increase in Ore Reserves from Union South Mine, Siphumelele 1 Mine, Kroondal Mine, Marikana Mine and Modikwa Mine where Mineral Resources have been converted to Ore Reserves.
The global Ore Reserve grade decreased following the increase of the minimum resource cut from 90cm to 110cm due to an improved rock support measures.
7 Platreef: The Ore Reserves tonnage and 4E ounce content increased as a result of a revised pit design.
Geotechnical study will commence in 2013 to validate the optimum pit design and increased mining depth.
For Mogalakwena North, Central and South the 4E pay limit is 1.0 g t. For Sandsloot and Zwartfontein South the pay limit is 1.7 g t. 8 Platreef stockpiles: Mined ore retained for future treatment.
These are reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves and aggregated into the summation tabulations.
9 Alternative units All Reefs Total: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2012 is: Total 1,774.3 Mton 2011: 1,630.4 Mton Total 0.096 oz ton 2011: 0.108 oz ton 10 Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not evaluated and therefore not reported as part of the Ore Reserves.
At Rustenburg mines and at Union mines dormant tailings dams have been evaluated and are separately reported as tailings Ore Reserves.
11 Main Sulphide Zone: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E ounce content increased after the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves, which followed an increase in resource con dence based on new drilling information.
12 Main Sulphide Zone: Anglo American Platinum currently has an effective 100% interest in Unki Mine, subject to the nalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
13 Alternative units Main Sulphide Zone: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2012 is: Total 59.2 Mton 2011: 42.6 Mton Total 0.110 oz ton 2011: 0.110 oz ton 214 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES PLATINUM GROUP METALS estimates as at 31 December 2012 1 2 3 3 Tonnes Grade Contained Metal Contained Metal Platinum South Africa Operations MINERAL RESOURCES Classi cation 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 4 5 Merensky Reef Mt Mt 4E PGE 4E PGE 4E tonnes 4E tonnes 4E Moz 4E Moz Measured 189.3 162.1 5.63 5.57 1,065.1 903.7 34.2 29.1 Indicated 290.6 273.5 5.51 5.54 1,600.1 1,515.4 51.4 48.7 Measured and Indicated 479.9 435.6 5.55 5.55 2,665.2 2,419.1 85.7 77.8 Inferred in LOM Plan 9.8 22.7 6.33 8.05 62.1 182.7 2.0 5.9 Inferred ex.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Tonnes: Quoted as dry metric tonnes.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 Contained Metal: Contained Metal is presented in metric tonnes and million troy ounces Moz.
4 Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the Resource Cut.
The minimum resource cut increased from 90cm to 110cm due to the introduction of an improved support system.
As a result of the increased minimum resource cut the overall Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef tonnage increased and the overall grade decreased.
The Resource Cut width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
5 Merensky Reef: The Mineral Resource tonnage and 4E ounce content increased in response to the re-allocation of Ore Reserve back to Mineral Resources following economic assumptions at Tumela and Siphumelele mines.
The increase in the minimum mining cut change in mine layout and new information contribute to the increase.
6 UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resource tonnage and 4E ounce content increased due to re-allocation of Ore Reserve to Mineral Resources after application of revised economic assumptions at Tumela, Twickenham and Siphumelele mines.
New information at Pandora Mine decreased the geological loss resulting in increased Mineral Resources.
A decrease of Mineral Resource occurred at Union South mine where additional Mineral Resources were converted to Ore Reserves.
7 Platreef: A 1.0g t 4E PGE cut-off has been used to fide ne Mineral Resources.
During 2012 pit design test work con rmed that Mineral Resources reported in 2011 can be mined via open pit.
Additional Mineral Resources were converted to Ore Reserves, decreasing the Platreef Resources.
No Mineral Resources applicable to underground mining have been included.
However, stockpile material is included which comprises calc-silicate and oxidised material with a cut-off grade of greater than 3g t 5.5 Mt 0.6 Moz.
8 Alternative units All Reefs Measured and Indicated: Tonnage in million short tons Mton and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton oz ton for 2012 is: Measured and Indicated 2759.5 Mton 2011: 2,838.1 Mton Measured and Indicated 0.121 oz ton 2011: 0.114 oz ton 9 Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not evaluated and therefore not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
At Rustenburg and Union mines dormant dams have been evaluated and the tailing forms part of the Mineral Resource statement.
10 Main Sulphide Zone: A new resource evaluation was completed covering Unki South, Helvetia, Paarl, KV and SR projects contained within the special mining lease held by Southridge Limited.
All projects are now incorporated in the Mineral Resources.
As a consequence the Mineral Resources tonnage and 4E ounce content increased signi cantly.
The bulk of the resources have been evaluated using a 120cm resource cut.
Unki East and West have been evaluated on a 180cm resource cut to support trackless mining.
The increase in tonnage and content is offset by the decrease of Mineral Resource due to additional conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves at the Unki East Mine.
Oxidised material is not considered.
11 Main Sulphide Zone: Anglo American Platinum currently has an effective 100% interest in Southridge Limited, subject to the nalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
