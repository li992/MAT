The Directors believe that the underlying profit before tax UPBT and underlying diluted and basic earnings per share measures presented provide a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying performance of Sainsburys ongoing business for shareholders.
Underlying profit is not defined by IFRS and therefore may not be directly comparable with the adjusted profit measures of other companies.
The adjusted items are: Profit loss on disposal of properties: Investment property fair value movements these reflect the difference between the fair value of an investment property at the reporting date and its carrying amount at the previous reporting date: Financing fair value movements these are fair value gains and losses on nonderivative financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost, on derivatives relating to financing activities and on hedged items in fair value hedges: Impairment of goodwill: The financing element of IAS 19 Employee Benefits: and Oneoff items these are items which are material and infrequent in nature and do not relate to the Groups underlying performance.

Oneoff items The 3 million oneoff item relates to the release of a provision in respect of the Office of Fair Trading dairy inquiry which was settled in full in October 2011.
The 5 million oneoff item in the prior financial year relates to the release of a disposal provision which was no longer required.
Both of these items were initially recorded as one-off items outside underlying profit before tax.
4 Segment reporting The Groups businesses are organised into three operating segments: Retailing Supermarkets and Convenience : Financial services Sainsburys Bank joint venture : and Property investments The British Land Company PLC joint venture and Land Securities PLC joint venture.

The change to 25.0 per cent was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011 and hence the effect of the change on the deferred tax balances has been included in the figures above.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J Sainsbury plc 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Income tax expense continued In addition to this, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the 21 March 2012 UK Budget Statement.
A resolution passed by Parliament on 26 March 2012 reduced the main rate of corporation tax to 24.0 per cent from 1 April 2012.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 24.0 per cent to 23.0 per cent from 1 April 2013 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2012.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by one per cent per annum to 22.0 per cent by 1 April 2014.
None of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, their effect is not included in the financial statements.
The effect of a one per cent reduction in the corporation tax rate on the deferred tax balances at the balance sheet date would reduce the deferred tax liability by 11 million which is primarily recognised in other comprehensive income.
As part of the funding plan agreed with the Pension Schemes Trustees, in June 2010 Sainsburys established the Sainsburys Property Scottish Partnership with the Scheme and properties with a value of 757 million were transferred to the Partnership.
The Government recently announced law changes in relation to such asset backed pension contributions.
Draft legislation published in November 2011 and amended in February and March 2012 which is expected to be included in Finance Act 2012, restricts the relief to the total amount of payments an employer makes to the pension scheme directly or through the Partnership.
These changes have not been substantively enacted so have not been included in the figures above.
Income tax charged or credited to equity and or other comprehensive income during the year is as follows: Share based Pension Fair value payments scheme movements Total m m m m 52 weeks to 17 March 2012 Current tax recognised in equity 58 1 59 Deferred tax recognised in equity 1 2 3 Revaluation of deferred tax balances 10 3 13 Income tax charged credited to equity 1 68 2 69 52 weeks to 19 March 2011 Current tax recognised in equity 1 1 Deferred tax recognised in equity 1 8 3 10 Revaluation of deferred tax balances 5 1 6 Income tax credited charged to equity 2 3 3 4 The current and deferred tax in relation to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes actuarial gains and losses and available for sale fair value movements have been charged or credited through other comprehensive income.

For diluted earnings per share, the earnings attributable to the ordinary shareholders are adjusted by the interest on the convertible bonds net of tax.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the number of shares that would be issued if all convertible bonds are assumed to be converted.
Underlying earnings per share is provided by excluding the effect of any profit or loss on disposal of properties, investment property fair value movements, impairment of goodwill, financing fair value movements, IAS 19 pension financing element and oneoff items that are material and infrequent in nature.
This alternative measure of earnings per share is presented to reflect the Groups underlying trading performance.

The Group has determined that for the purposes of impairment testing, following a triggering event, each store is a cash-generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amounts for the CGUs are based on value in use which is calculated on the cash flows expected to be generated by the units using the latest budget and forecast data, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation are the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes in margin.
Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated longterm growth rates for the UK food retail sector.
The discount rate is based on the Groups pretax weighted average cost of capital of ten per cent 2011: ten per cent.
Non-store assets are also tested for impairment in the event that a triggering event is identified.
When an impairment is required, the carrying value of the asset is compared to its value in use using a methodology consistent with that described above.

The goodwill balance above relates primarily to the Groups acquisitions of Bells Stores Ltd, Jacksons Stores Ltd, JB Beaumont Ltd, SL Shaw Ltd, Culcheth Provision Stores Ltd, Town Centre Retail Bicester Ltd, SW Dewsbury Ltd and Portfolio Investments Ltd and is allocated to the respective cashgenerating units CGUs within the Retailing segment.
The CGUs for this purpose are deemed to be the respective acquired retail chains of stores.
The value of the goodwill was tested for impairment during the current financial year by means of comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU to the carrying value of its goodwill.
To calculate the CGUs value in use, Board approved cash flows for the following financial year are assumed to inflate at the longterm average growth rate for the UK food retail sector and are discounted at a pretax rate of ten per cent 2011: ten per cent over a 25 year period.
Based on the operating performance of the respective CGUs, no impairment loss was identified in the current financial year 2011: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

During the year, a provision of 1 million was made against investments in subsidiaries where the carrying value exceeded the recoverable amount 2011: 4 million.
The Group has an interest in two partnerships, Sainsburys Property Scottish Partnership and Sainsburys Property Scottish Limited Partnership, which are fully consolidated into these Group accounts.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships Accounts Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts.

The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to convert 211 million 2011: 211 million of the 1,036 million 2011: 1,069 million loan due 2018 from fixed to floating rates of interest.
These transactions have been accounted for as fair value hedges note 29.
In previous years, 572 million of swaps accounted for as fair value hedges were dedesignated from their fair value hedging relationship.
The fair value adjustment of the debt previously hedged by these swaps will be amortised over the remaining life of the loans, resulting in an amortisation charge to the income statement in the current financial year of 1 million 2011: 1 million.
In September 2011, the Group entered into inflation linked swaps to convert 250 million 2011: nil of the 843 million 2011: 840 million loan due 2031 from RPI linked interest to fixed rate interest for the period from April 2012 to April 2017.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to counterparty default or non-performance risk on its holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities and trade receivables.
The Group credit policy limits investments to counter parties with minimum credit ratings of A1 from Standard & Poors and P1 from Moodys Investors Service or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAAm from Standard & Poors or Aaa MR1 from Moodys Investors Service.
The Group deposits surplus funds directly with approved banks on the wholesale inter-bank money markets or with approved money market funds as pooled investments.

Market risk a Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk as a result of potential movements in exchange rates impacting supplier contracts denominated in currencies other than pound sterling.
The Group also has limited exposure in respect of recognised foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of movements in exchange rates on Group income by requiring anticipated foreign currency cash flows primarily in US dollars and euros to be hedged.
The future cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged between 80 per cent and 20 per cent using forward contracts and options.
The Group has limited exposure to currency risk on balances held on foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to shortterm timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.
The Group considers that a ten per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The impacts of these changes in exchange rates in US dollar and euros versus sterling at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant is summarised in the following table: 2012 2011 Change in Change in Change in Change in Change in Change in exchange exchange exchange exchange exchange exchange rate impact rate impact rate impact rate impact rate impact rate impact on post-tax on cash flow on cash flow on post-tax on cash flow on cash flow profit hedge reserve hedge reserve profit hedge reserve hedge reserve 10% 10% 10% 20% 20% 20% m m m m m m USD GBP 1 1 26 32 2 2 46 71 EUR GBP 1 1 8 10 1 1 12 18 b Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on borrowings and deposits.
The Groups interest rate policy seeks to minimise the cost and volatility of the Groups interest expense by maintaining a diversified portfolio of fixed rate, floating rate and inflation-linked liabilities.
i Fair value sensitivity for fixed rate instruments The Group holds 1,291 million of fixed rate debt 2011: 1,259 million, of which 424 million 2011: 401 million has been swapped into floating rate debt using interest rate swaps.
The remaining 867 million 2011: 858 million portion of fixed rate debt is recorded at amortised cost and a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect the income statement.
For the year, the fair value movement in the interest rate swaps has resulted in a credit to the income statement of 8 million 2011: 6 million.
The fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt has resulted in a charge to the income statement of 10 million 2011: 3 million which represents the ineffectiveness on the hedging relationship.
ii Cash flow sensitivity for variable rate instruments The Group holds 526 million of floating rate borrowings 2011: 686 million, comprising 485 million of floating rate swaps 2011: 461 million and 41 million of floating rate debt 2011: 225 million.
The Group also holds 542 million of interest bearing assets 2011: 301 million.
102 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued The Group considers that a 100 basis point increase is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The sensitivity of these balances to changes of 100 basis points in the floating rate at the balance sheet date on post-tax profit is shown below.
Where a decrease of 100 basis points would reflect a negative rate, the assumed rate is nil: 2012 2011 Change in Change in Change in Change in floating rate floating rate floating rate floating rate 100 bps 100 bps 100 bps 100 bps m m m m Floating rate borrowings 14 16 5 4 Interest bearing assets 4 2 2 2 iii Cash flow sensitivity for inflation-linked variable instruments The Group holds 843 million of inflation-linked debt 2011: 840 million which is recorded at amortised cost.
The Group considers that a 100 basis point increase is a reasonable measure of volatility.
The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 100 basis points in the RPI at the balance sheet date on post-tax profit is shown below: 2012 2011 Change in RPI Change in RPI Change in RPI Change in RPI 100 bps 100 bps 100 bps 100 bps m m m m Inflation linked debt 6 6 6 In September 2011, the Group entered into an inflation linked swap to convert 250 million 2011: nil of the 843 million 2011: 840 million loan due 2031 from RPI linked to fixed rate interest for the period April 2012 to April 2017.
A 100 basis points change in the RPI at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by 12 million 2011: nil.
iv Fair value sensitivity for available-for-sale assets Included within available-for-sale financial assets is 146 million 2011: 140 million relating to the Groups beneficial interest in a property investment pool.
The net present value of the Groups interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of three per cent per annum 2011: 3.2 per cent and a discount rate of ten per cent 2011: ten per cent, see note 15.
The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 0.5 per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth and one per cent in the discount rate holding other assumptions constant is shown below: 2012 2011 Change in Change in Change in Change in growth rate discount rate growth rate discount rate 0.5% 1.0% 0.5% 1.0% m m m m Available-for-sale assets 10 10 14 16 9 12 16 15 Commodity risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk within its commercial buying operations and with respect to its own use consumption of electricity, gas and fuel.
The Groups Energy Price Risk Committee seeks to limit the impact of movements in commodity prices on Group income by requiring forecast purchases of power and fuel to be hedged.
The Group uses financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference.
The Group considers a ten per cent movement in commodity rates a reasonable measure of volatility.
A ten per cent 2011: 20 per cent change in the fair value of the commodity price at the balance sheet date would have increased or decreased the cash flow equity reserve by 4 million 2011: 5 million.
The Group hedges own consumption electricity and gas exposures with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with relevant suppliers.
The Group has also entered into several long-term fixed price power purchase agreements with independent producers.
Included within derivative financial assets is 3 million 2011: 4 million relating to these agreements.
The Group values agreements as the net present value of fixed price future expected energy purchases less the market implied forward energy price discounted back at the prevailing swap rate.
The Group also makes an assumption regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producers estimate of expected electricity output.
The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 20 per cent in the assumed rate of energy output and ten per cent in the implied forward energy prices holding other assumptions constant is shown below: 2012 2011 Change in Change in Change in electricity Change in electricity volume forward price volume forward price 20.0% 10.0% 20.0% 10.0% m m m m Derivative financial instruments 1 1 3 3 1 1 3 3 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 J Sainsbury plc 103 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued Capital risk management The Group defines the capital that it manages as total equity plus net debt balances.
The Boards objective is to safeguard the Groups ability to remain a going concern and to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Groups strategic objectives and to maintain its ability to provide optimal returns for shareholders.
There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes funding decisions based on the prevailing economic environment and has a number of tools available to manage capital risk.
These include maintaining a diversified debt portfolio, the ability to adjust the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, to recycle capital through the sale and leaseback programme, the issue of new shares or the repurchase of shares on the open market to flex capital expenditure.
The Board has a policy to maintain the underlying earnings cover for the ordinary dividend at a minimum of 1.5 times.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Groups share option programmes.
The Group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
The Board monitors a range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, gearing and fixed charge cover.
A key objective of the Groups capital risk management is to maintain compliance with the covenants attached to the Groups debt.
Throughout the year, the Group has comfortably complied with these covenants.

Under the terms of the swaps, the Group receives fixed interest and pays floating rate interest at a fixed spread above three-month LIBOR.
The notional principal amount of one of the interest rate swaps amortises from 211 million to 111 million from April 2016 to April 2018.
Derivative financial instruments fair value through profit and loss At 17 March 2012, the Group held a portfolio of interest rate swaps at fair value through profit or loss which convert 331 million of the Groups floating rate obligations into fixed rates 2011: 331 million.
Under the terms of these swaps the Group pays fixed rates of interest and receives three-month LIBOR for periods expiring from 19 April 2018 to 19 April 2031.
Included in this portfolio is a 150 million swap under which the counterparty has a recurring option to cancel the swap on quarterly payment dates through to January 2031 at zero cost.
The Group holds a portfolio of non-designated interest rate swaps which convert 391 million of fixed rate borrowings into floating rates 2011: 391 million.
Under the terms of the swap the Group receives fixed rates of interest and pays floating rates of interest at various spreads above three-month LIBOR until 19 April 2018.
Interest rate risk Financial instruments where interest is re-priced at intervals of one year or less are classified as floating rate.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
Foreign currency risk The Group has net euro denominated trade payables of 12 million 2011: 11 million and US dollar denominated trade payables of 11 million 2011: 14 million.
Fair value Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements at other than fair values.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices that are available from the market on which the instruments are traded where available.
The fair values of all other financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, overdrafts and payables are assumed to approximate to their book values, and are excluded from the analysis below.

108 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Retirement benefit obligations Retirement benefit obligations relate to a defined benefit scheme, the Sainsburys Pension Scheme, the Scheme and an unfunded pension liability relating to senior employees.
The Scheme was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Scheme was subject to a triennial actuarial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the schemes independent actuaries, at March 2009 on the projected unit basis.
The results of this valuation were approved by the Schemes Trustees in June 2010.
The retirement benefit obligations at 17 March 2012 have been calculated, where appropriate, on a basis consistent with this valuation.
A triennial valuation will be carried out at March 2012 by Towers Watson, the Schemes independent actuaries on the projected unit basis with a statutory completion date of June 2013.
The unfunded pension liability is unwound when each employee reaches retirement and takes their pension from the Group payroll or is crystallised in the event of an employee leaving or retiring and choosing to take the provision as a one-off cash payment.
Sainsburys Property Scottish Limited Partnership Further to the funding plan agreed with the Schemes Trustees, on 17 June 2010 Sainsburys established the Sainsburys Property Scottish Partnership the Partnership with the Scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to a fair value of 256 million were transferred to the Partnership.
On 25 March 2011, further properties to a fair value of 501 million were transferred to the Partnership.
Both transfers were effected via a 30 year sale and leaseback arrangement.
The Schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 35 million for 20 years.
These contributions will be in addition to the Groups normal cash contributions paid to the Scheme annually.
The properties transferred to the Partnership will revert to Sainsburys ownership in 2030 in return for a cash payment equal to the amount of any remaining funding deficit on the Scheme at that time, up to a maximum of 600 million.
The Partnership is controlled by Sainsburys and its results are consolidated by the Group.
The Groups balance sheet, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership.
The investment held by the Scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.
The value of the properties transferred to the Partnership remains included within the Groups property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
In addition, the Group retains full operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute the properties within the Partnership.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 2012 2011 m m Present value of funded obligations 5,654 4,945 Fair value of plan assets 5,192 4,614 462 331 Present value of unfunded obligations 9 9 Retirement benefit obligations 471 340 Deferred income tax asset 16 99 Net retirement benefit obligations 455 241 The retirement benefit obligations and the associated deferred income tax balance are shown within different line items on the face of the balance sheet.

e Sensitivities An increase of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by 548 million.
A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 614 million.
An increase of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would increase the retirement benefit obligations by 408 million.
A decrease of 0.5 per cent in the inflation rate would decrease the retirement benefit obligations by 389 million.

No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: 2012 2011 Share price at grant date pence 298 371 Exercise price pence 238 297 Expected volatility 3 year period % 22.4 34.3 5 year period % 32.2 29.5 Option life 3 year period years 3.2 3.2 5 year period years 5.2 5.2 Expected dividends expressed as dividend yield % 3.6 3.5 Riskfree interest rate 3 year period % 1.3 3.2 5 year period % 2.5 4.4 Fair value per option 3 year period pence 60 109 5 year period pence 85 114 The expected volatility is based on the standard deviation of the Groups share price for the period immediately prior to the date of grant of award, over the period identical to the vesting period of the award, adjusted for managements view of future volatility of the share price.
The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three or five years, as appropriate, on the assumption that 25 per cent of options will be cancelled over the service period as employees leave the SAYE scheme.
112 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 Financial Statements Financial Statements Notes to the financial statements continued 31 Share-based payments continued b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Under the Executive Share Option Plan, participants were granted options to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.
The maximum annual option award was two times basic salary and the grants were agreed by the Remuneration Committee according to the assessed performance and potential of participants.
The exercise of options is conditional upon a performance target based on the growth in the Companys underlying earnings per share EPS relative to inflation over a three-year period.
EPS is measured against a fixed starting point over the performance period beginning with the year in which the option was granted.
To the extent that the condition is not satisfied in full after three years, it will be retested on a fixed-point basis over four and then five financial years.
To the extent the condition is not met after five financial years, the option will lapse.
Once the options vest, participants remaining in the Groups employment or leaving for certain reasons, are entitled to exercise the options between vesting date normally at the end of the three-year performance period and the option expiry date, which is ten years from date of grant.
It is intended that there will be no further options granted under this plan.

d Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006 Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan 2006, shares are conditionally awarded to the top managers in the Company.
The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants salaries and scaled according to grades.
The awards will vest if the threshold levels of two co-dependent performance conditions Return on Capital Employed ROCE and growth in cash flow per share, are achieved over the three-year performance period.
The core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance.
Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points.
Performance will be measured at the end of the three-year performance period.
If the required level of performance has been reached, the awards vest and 50 per cent of the award will be released.
Subject to participants remaining in employment for a further year, the balance will then be released no later than on the fourth anniversary of the date of award.
Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire two years from the vesting date.
Dividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.

Alliance Boots was removed from the comparator group following its fide-listing.
Up to two matched shares could be awarded for each share deferred depending on the extent to which the TSR measure was achieved.
No shares were awarded for below median performance, and the full match only applied where the Company achieved first place within the comparator group.
At median position the match was 0.5 shares for each deferred bonus share and the share match was pro-rated at every position between median and first place.
