Pension arrangements Defined benefit schemes The Group operates three final salary schemes.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the TP scheme, which for the majority of members is a 1 60th scheme.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2011.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2011 valuation, and then updated to 31 December 2012 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
Following the acquisition of The BSS group plc the Group, operated three additional defined benefit pension schemes the BSS schemes based on final pensionable salary.
On 6 April 2012 the defined benefit section of the Tricom Retirement and Death Benefits scheme was transferred to the TP scheme.
The BSS Ireland scheme is immaterial.
The assets of the BSS schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees..
The most recent actuarial valuations of the BSS schemes assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2009 for the UK and the Irish schemes.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010, an agreement was reached with the trustees of the Travis Perkins final salary pension scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a group controlled special purpose vehicle.
The pension scheme will be entitled to receive the income of the SPV for a period of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.
As the SPV is consolidated into the Travis Perkins plc group accounts advantage has been taken of Regulation 7 of The Partnership Accounts Regulations 2008 and accounts for the SPV will neither be audited or filed.
