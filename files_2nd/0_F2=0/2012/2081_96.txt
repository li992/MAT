At BHP Billiton, our purpose is to create long-term shareholder value through the discovery, acquisition, development and marketing of natural resources.
Your Board oversees the consistent execution of BHP Billitons long-stated business strategy and commitment to transparent and high-quality governance.
Our approach We believe that long-term value creation is supported by high-quality governance.
Our governance framework reflects the regulatory requirements of Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, given our listings in those three countries.
Beyond regulatory requirements, we adopt what we consider to be the highest of governance standards in those jurisdictions.
Underpinning this is our overall approach to governance: We believe governance is not just a matter for the Board.
Good governance must be fostered throughout the organisation.
We strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.
We set out in the BHP Billiton Code of Business Conduct our expectations of our employees and those to whom we contract business.
Our statement of full compliance with the governance codes that apply to us is set out in section 5.22, and an outline of our governance structure is set out below.
BHP Billiton governance structure SHAREHOLDERS Ongoing renewal We are continuously focused on enhancing the diversity of perspective on the Board.
We do this in a structured manner, looking out over a five-year period at the skills, backgrounds, knowledge, experience and diversity on the Board.
The right blend of skills, experience and perspective is critical to ensuring the Board oversees BHP Billiton effectively for shareholders.
Our immediate business imperative in FY2012 was to appoint an additional Director with skills and experience in the oil and gas sector.
Pat Davies, former Chief Executive of Sasol Limited, commenced as a Director in June 2012 and he brings this specific experience, as well as a broad range of international commercial and business skills.
The Board has set an aspirational goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three over the next two years.
If achieved, this would see the proportion of women on the Board increase from 15 per cent currently to 23 per cent, based on a Board size of 13.
Continuous improvement The Board has a commitment to ongoing improvement in the way it carries out its work.
The continued evolution of the Board and its committees resulted in the formation of the Finance Committee during FY2012.
The Board is of the view that our governance structure is enhanced by a committee that focuses on capital structure funding, capital management planning and due diligence.
As part of our commitment to continuous improvement, the role and function of the Finance Committee will be evaluated not later than 12 months after its establishment.
This year, with the assistance of independent advisers, we completed an assessment of each Director individually and implemented recommendations from Committee reviews.
As a consequence, we initiated a number of changes to our committee and Board processes.
Further information is set out in section 5.10.
We believe the evaluation process is an important part of continuous improvement.
You will also see some changes to our Corporate Governance Statement this year, as we strive to continually improve our transparency and our dialogue with shareholders.
I hope you find this report useful and look forward to feedback fellow shareholders may have.
