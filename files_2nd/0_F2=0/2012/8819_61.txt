The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% from 1 April 2013 was enacted on 17 July 2012.
As this rate was enacted at the balance sheet date, and reduces the tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences reverse, it had the effect of reducing the UK deferred tax asset.
However, as most of the UK deferred tax asset relates to the UK pension deficit, which has arisen predominantly due to actuarial gains losses taken to other comprehensive income, the majority of the reduction has been debited to other comprehensive income and does not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on profit for the year.
It is expected that this treatment will also apply in relation to the further rate reductions announced by the Government.
Those further rate reductions are to be incorporated within future legislative acts and so will not be substantively enacted until later periods.
The estimated effect of the further reductions in the rate to 21% by 2014 would be to decrease the net UK deferred tax asset by 1.0m.
