National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory accounting statements 2011 12 55 Notes to the consolidated financial statements - analysis of items in the primary statements 1.
Segmental analysis The Board of Directors is National Grid Gas plc's chief operating decision making body as defined by IFRS 8 on operating segments.
The segmental analysis is based on the information the Board of Directors uses internally for the purposes of evaluating the performance of operating segments and determining resource allocation between segments.
The performance of operating segments is assessed principally on the basis of operating profit before exceptional items.
The following table describes the main activities for each operating segment: Gas Transmission - the gas transmission network in the UK and the associated UK liquefied natural gas LNG storage activities Gas Distribution - four of the eight regional networks of Great Britain's gas distribution system Gas Metering - regulated gas metering activities in the UK Other activities relate to the xoserve business which provides transportation transaction services on behalf of all the major gas network transportation companies, including ourselves, together with corporate activities.
Our segments are unchanged from those reported in the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011.
All of the Company's sales and operations take place within the UK.
Sales between businesses are priced having regard to the regulatory and legal requirements that the businesses are subject to, which include requirements to avoid cross-subsidies.

Pensions Substantially all of our employees are members of either the defined benefit section or the defined contribution section of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
There is no contractual arrangement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost of the scheme to the Company.
Accordingly, the Company accounts for the defined benefit section of the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
For further details regarding the nature and terms of the scheme and the actuarial assumptions used to value the associated assets and pension obligations, refer to note 25.

Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 24% from April 2012 was announced in the 2012 UK Budget Report and has been enacted in Finance Act 2012.
This had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, as such, deferred tax balances have been calculated at this rate.
Other changes, such as the proposed reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% from April 2013, with a further 1% reduction in the following year, will result in a UK corporation tax rate of 22% from April 2014.
Although the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 23% has now been enacted, none of these rate changes had been substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date and have therefore not been reflected in these financial statements.
The process for reforming the UK's rules for taxing controlled foreign companies completed with the issue of draft legislation in the Finance Bill 2012.
This has now been enacted in Finance Act 2012 and we do not expect any material adverse impact of this legislation on our holdings in foreign operations.

Cash flows are expected to be incurred between 2012 and 2060.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2012 was 92m 2011: 112m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2012, 14m of the total restructuring provision 2011: 26m related to the restructuring of our LNG storage facilities, and 13m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2011: 14m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.
The remainder of the restructuring provision related to business reorganisation costs, to be paid over the next two years.
Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2012 include 24m 2011: 22m in respect of employer liability claims.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.

Actuarial information on pensions The National Grid UK Pension Scheme is funded with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The defined benefit section of the scheme is subject to independent actuarial valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers' contribution which, together with the specified contributions payable by employees and the proceeds from the scheme's assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the scheme.
The next valuation will be based on the position at 31 March 2013.
The results of the 2010 valuation are shown below: Latest full actuarial valuation 31 March 2010 Actuary Towers Watson Market value of scheme assets at latest valuation 13,399m Actuarial value of benefits due to members 13,998 m Market value as percentage of benefits 96% Funding deficit 599m Funding deficit net of tax 455m The 2010 actuarial valuation showed that, based on long-term financial assumptions, the contribution rate required to meet future benefit accrual was 35% of pensionable earnings 32% employers and 3% employees.
In addition, National Grid makes payments to the scheme to cover administration costs and the Pension Protection Fund levy.
The employer contribution rate will be reviewed as part of the next valuation in 2013, while the administration costs are reviewed annually.
Following the 2010 actuarial valuation, National Grid and the Trustees agreed a recovery plan which will see the funding deficit repaid by 31 March 2027.
Under the schedule of contributions, no deficit contributions were made in 2010 11 or 2011 12.
An annual payment of 47m, rising in line with retail price inflation from March 2010, will commence in 2012 13 and continue until 2027.
Following this agreement, the Company has established a secured bank account with a charge in favour of the Trustees of the National Grid UK Pension Scheme.
The balance of the bank account at 31 March 2012 was 142m.
The funds in the bank account will be paid to the scheme in the event that National Grid Gas plc is subject to an insolvency event, or is given notice of less than 12 months that Ofgem intends to revoke its licence under the Gas Act 1986.
The funds in the bank account will be released back to the Company if the scheme moves into surplus.
This defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new members since 1 April 2002.
A defined contribution arrangement has been offered to new employees since that date.
Asset allocations The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets were as follows: 2012 2011 % % Equities 31.6 33.6 Corporate bonds 35.7 32.4 Gilts 23.1 26.6 Property 7.6 6.1 Other 2.0 1.3 Total 100.0 100.0 Actuarial assumptions The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been set reflecting the price inflation expectation, the expected real return on each major asset class and the long-term asset allocation strategy adopted for the scheme.
The expected real returns on specific asset classes reflect historical returns, investment yields on the measurement date and general future return expectations, and have been set after taking advice from the scheme's actuaries.

Supplementary information on derivative financial instruments Treasury financial instruments Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of an underlying item such as interest rates, foreign exchange, credit spreads, commodities, equities or other indices.
Derivatives enable their users to alter exposure to these market or credit risks.
We use derivatives to manage the interest rate and foreign exchange risks from our financing portfolio and this enables the optimisation of the overall cost of accessing debt capital markets.
We calculate fair value of the financial derivatives by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The market yield curve for each currency is obtained from external sources for interest and foreign exchange rates.
In the case of derivative instruments that include options, the Black's variation of the Black-scholes model is used to calculate the fair value.
Hedging policies using derivative financial instruments are further explained in note 27 and, where possible, derivatives held as hedging instruments are formally designated as hedges as defined in IAS 39.
Derivatives may qualify as hedges for accounting purposes if they are fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.
These are described as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges principally consist of interest rate and cross-currency swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term financial instruments due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
If the hedge relationship is terminated, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item continues to be reported as part of the basis of the item and is amortised to the income statement as a yield adjustment over the remainder of the life of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges Exposure arises from the variability in future interest and currency cash flows on assets and liabilities which bear interest at variable rates or are in a foreign currency.
Interest rate and cross-currency swaps are maintained, and designated as cash flow hedges where they qualify, to manage this exposure.
Fair value changes on designated cash flow hedges are initially recognised directly in the cash flow hedge reserve, as gains or losses recognised in equity.
Amounts are transferred from equity and recognised in the income statement as the income or expense is recognised on the hedged asset or liability.
Forward foreign currency contracts are used to hedge anticipated and committed future currency cash flows.
Where these contracts qualify for hedge accounting, they are designated as cash flow hedges.
On recognition of the underlying transaction in the financial statements, the associated hedge gains and losses deferred in equity are transferred and included with the recognition of the underlying transaction.
The gains and losses on ineffective portions of such derivatives are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement or on the balance sheet.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to remeasurements within the income statement.
Derivatives not in a formal hedge relationship Our policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes.
However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting under IAS 39, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or are specifically not designated as a hedge where natural offset is more appropriate.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in remeasurements within the income statement.

Financial risk Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk, including foreign exchange risk: fair value interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk: credit risk: and liquidity risk.
Our overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance.
We use financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments to manage risks of this type.
Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Finance Committees of the Board of Directors of National Grid plc and the Company.
The objective of the treasury department is to manage funding and liquidity requirements, including managing associated financial risks, to within acceptable boundaries.
The Finance Committee of the Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk We are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from non-sterling future commercial transactions and non-sterling recognised assets and liabilities.
Our policy for managing foreign exchange risk is to hedge contractually committed foreign currency cash flows over a prescribed minimum size.
Where cash forecasts are less certain, we hedge a proportion of the foreign currency flows based on the probability of those cash flows occurring.
Instruments used to manage foreign exchange risk include foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swaps.
During 2012 and 2011, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign exchange risk as follows: 2012 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents - 1 - - 1 Financial investments 451 - - - 451 Borrowings i 6,135 832 802 370 8,139 Pre-derivative position 5,684 831 802 370 7,687 Derivative effect 1,458 787 800 370 499 Net debt position 7,142 44 2 - 7,188 2011 Sterling Euro Dollar Other Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 82 1 - - 83 Financial investments 242 - - - 242 Borrowings i 5,962 876 719 345 7,902 Pre-derivative position 5,638 875 719 345 7,577 Derivative effect 1,406 848 720 345 507 Net debt position 7,044 27 1 - 7,070 i Includes bank overdrafts There was no significant currency exposure on other financial instruments, including trade receivables and payables, and other receivables and payables.
National Grid Gas plc NTS Regulatory accounting statements 2011 12 75 27.
Financial risk continued a Market risk continued ii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on our long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose us to cash flow interest rate risk, partially offset by cash held at variable rates.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose us to fair value interest rate risk.
Our interest rate risk management policy seeks to minimise total financing costs being interest costs and changes in the market value of debt subject to constraints.
We do this by using fixed and floating-rate debt and derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
We hold some borrowings on issue that are inflation linked.
We believe that these provide a partial economic offset to the inflation risk associated with our inflation linked revenues.
The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual maturity, of borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: 2012 2011 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings Less than 1 year 104 83 In 1 - 2 years 481 24 In 2 - 3 years - 501 In 3 - 4 years - - In 4 - 5 years 54 - More than 5 years 2,781 2,658 3,420 3,266 Floating interest rate borrowings including RPI linked 4,719 4,583 Non-interest bearing borrowings - 53 Total borrowings 8,139 7,902 During 2012 and 2011, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: 2012 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 1 - - - 1 Financial investments - 431 - 20 451 Borrowings iii 3,420 950 3,769 - 8,139 Pre-derivative position 3,419 519 3,769 20 7,687 Derivative effect 819 435 115 - 499 Net debt position iv 2,600 954 3,654 20 7,188 2011 Fixed Floating rate rate RPI i Other ii Total m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 83 - - - 83 Financial investments - 242 - - 242 Borrowings iii 3,266 958 3,625 53 7,902 Pre-derivative position 3,183 716 3,625 53 7,577 Derivative effect 1,413 1,135 229 - 507 Net debt position iv 1,770 1,851 3,396 53 7,070 i The post-derivative impact represents financial instruments linked to UK RPI.

Financial risk continued b Fair value analysis The following provides an analysis of our financial instruments measured at fair value.
They are reported in a tiered hierarchy based on the valuation methodology described in note 26 and reflecting the significance of market observable inputs.
The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an actively traded market.
In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not active, a valuation technique is used.
2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets Available-for-sale investments 174 - - 174 223 - - 223 Derivative financial instruments - 941 1 942 - 614 1 615 174 941 1 1,116 223 614 1 838 - - - Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - 348 95 443 - 108 - 108 Total 174 593 94 673 223 506 1 730 Level 1: Financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models where all significant inputs are based directly or indirectly on observable market data.
Level 3: Financial instruments valued using techniques where one or more significant inputs are based on unobservable market data.
During the year no transfers have been made between the hierarchy levels.
The financial instruments classified as level 3 are currency swaps where the currency forward curve is illiquid and inflation linked swaps where the inflation curve is illiquid.
In valuing these instruments, third party valuations are obtained from more than one source to support the reported value.
The changes in the value of our level 3 derivative financial instruments are as follows: 2012 2011 Level 3 Level 3 Valuation Valuation m m At 1 April 1 2 Net losses for the year i 22 - Purchases 72 - Settlements 1 1 At 31 March 94 1 i Losses of 22m 2011: nil are attributable to assets or liabilities held at the end of the reporting period and have been recognised in finance costs in the income statement.
During the year, limited price inflation LPI swaps were transacted.
These derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in the LPI market curve.
An illustrative movement in the basis points of the LPI market curve would have the following impacts, after the effects of tax: 2012 Income Other Statement equity reserves m m 20 basis points change in LPI market curve 22 - - 20 basis points change in LPI market curve 21 - A reasonably possible change in assumptions of all other level 3 instruments is unlikely to result in a material change of fair values.

Financial risk continued c Credit risk We are exposed to the risk of loss resulting from counterparties' default on their commitments including failure to pay or make a delivery on a contract.
This risk is inherent in commercial business activities.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to wholesale and retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from the use of derivative instruments.
Our limits are managed by the central treasury department of National Grid, as explained under Principal risk factors on pages 16 and 17.
As at 31 March 2012 and 2011, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and counterparty credit exposure utilisations are monitored daily against the counterparty credit limits.
Counterparty credit ratings and market conditions are reviewed continually with limits being revised and utilisation adjusted, if appropriate.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under derivative financial contracts as shown in note 11 was 942m 2011: 615m : after netting agreements it was 789m 2011: 576m.
This exposure is further reduced by collateral received as shown in note 16.
Wholesale and retail credit risk Our principal commercial exposure is governed by the credit rules within the Uniform Network Code.
These lay down the level of credit relative to the regulatory asset value for each credit rating.
Sales to retail customers, such as those requiring connections, are usually settled in cash or using major credit cards.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 13. d Liquidity analysis We determine our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.
The following is an analysis of the contractual undiscounted cash flows payable under financial liabilities, and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date: Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2012 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 847 475 125 6,661 8,108 Interest payments on borrowings i 229 211 211 3,233 3,884 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 380 16 - - 396 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contracts - receipts 122 475 451 218 1,266 Derivative contract - payments 75 379 187 121 762 Total at 31 March 2012 1,409 606 72 9,797 11,884 Due Due Due Due between between 3 years within 1 and 2 2 and 3 and 1 year years years beyond Total At 31 March 2011 m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Borrowings 679 223 501 6,645 8,048 Interest payments on borrowings i 237 237 219 3,494 4,187 Other non-interest bearing liabilities 455 22 - - 477 Derivative financial liabilities Derivative contract - receipts 95 119 132 726 1,072 Derivative contract - payments 23 32 23 549 627 Total at 31 March 2011 1,299 395 611 9,962 12,267 i The interest on borrowings is calculated based on borrowings held at 31 March without taking account of future issues.

The analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of provisions.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant, and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2011, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale investments, as debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: changes in the carrying value of derivatives from movements in interest rates designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be recorded fully within equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: debt with a maturity below one year is floating rate for the accrued interest part of the calculation: the floating leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in interest rates affects a full 12 month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: and sensitivity to the UK RPI does not take into account any changes to revenue or operating costs that are affected by the UK RPI or inflation generally.
Inflation linked derivative sensitivity assumes that changes to nominal interest rates are solely due to changes in inflation.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative impact on the income statement and items that are recognised directly in equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in changes in the UK RPI and UK interest rates, after the effects of tax.

The income statement sensitivities impact interest expense and financial instrument remeasurements.
f Capital and risk management Our objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, to remain within regulatory constraints and to maintain an efficient mix of debt and equity funding thus achieving an optimal capital structure and cost of capital.
The principal measure of balance sheet efficiency is gearing calculated as net debt expressed as a percentage of regulatory asset value RAV.
The RAV gearing ratio at 31 March 2012 was 52% compared with 54% at 31 March 2011.
We regularly review and maintain or adjust the capital structure as appropriate in order to manage the level of RAV gearing.
Our licence and some of our bank loan agreements impose lower limits for the long-term credit ratings that the Company must hold.
These requirements are monitored on a regular basis in order to ensure compliance.
