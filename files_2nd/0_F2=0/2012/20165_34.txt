Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
Areasonable alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted.
This would have a positive impact on the portfolio of 100million 2011: 146million or 7% 2011: 7% of total unquoted equity value.

However in the prior year, on 15 February 2011, Mizuho Investment Management UK Limited MIM, one of the leading debt management businesses in Europe, became a subsidiary of the Group.
MIM has since changed its name to 3i Debt Management Investments Limited.
The acquisition formed part of the Groups strategy to build its Debt Management business line.
The acquisition of MIM was effected by 3i Debt Management Limited 3iDM on 15 February 2011.
3iDM paid cash consideration of 18million for 100% of the issued share capital of MIM.
The equity shares of 3iDM are owned 55% by the Group and 45% by the management team of MIM.
The Group entered into agreements to purchase this remaining 45% of the equity of 3iDM from the management team over the next five years, with the price subject to the performance of 3iDM and its subsidiaries.
After the year end the Group entered into agreements to purchase 2.7% of the remaining 45% equity from a member of the management team who is no longer employed by 3iDM.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the purchase of the management teams equity holding or earn-out was reflected in two parts: 13million deferred consideration, for the transfer of the remaining 45% of the shares held by MIM management over five years.
This was recognised on acquisition and is carried as a liability on the Group balance sheet.
The remaining amount is contingent on the individuals remaining in employment with 3i and 3iDM.
The amount will be determined by the performance of3iDM during the five-year period and will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as carried interest and performance fees payable.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2011, MIM contributed 2million to management fees, and incurred operating expenses and amortisation ofthefund management contracts of 2million, which resulted in an overall charge of nil to the net profit before tax of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year to 31 March 2011, the contribution to the Groups revenue from continuing operations would have been 16million and the profit from continuing operations for the Group would have been 5million.
Transaction costs of 4million were charged to operating expenses in the prior year.
The Group also acquired equity investments in the funds managed by MIM, on which the unrealised profit on revaluation in the period to 31 March 2011 was 7million.

This note provides further detailon financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to a risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 21 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capitalismanaged so as to maximise long-term return to shareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively inthemarketplace and sustain future development of the business.

No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FSA.
Thelast submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FSAs prudential rules.
The Groups capital requirement is updated annually following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3i Investments plc.
The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FSA and remains at a significant regulatory capital surplus.
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.
Financial risks Concentration risk The Groups exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the investment and treasury and funding sections in the Risk section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in note 1, segmental analysis.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, traded portfolio, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety ofcounterparties with circa 41% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with 3isrelationship banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Loan impairments are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases an appropriate loan impairment isrecorded to reflect the valuation shortfall.
Further information on how credit risk is managed is given in the Risk section.
In accordance with IFRS 7, theamounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 100 basis points would lead to an approximate increase in net assets of 6million 2011: 5million increase for the Group and 7million 2011: 6million increase for the Company.
This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable and payable on floating rate, short-term instruments, including cash and deposits in the current year.
In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to profit and loss.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 549million 2011: 603million.
Interest rate swaps The Group has one interest rate derivative.
The fair value of this contract is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cashflows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
This contract is not designated as a hedging instrument, as defined in IAS 39, andconsequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount outstanding of the variable rate to variable rate swap was 150million.
The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures theyare hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the statement of comprehensive income.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in note 13, derivative financial instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs.
Derivative assets and liabilities have been reclassified for prior periods between current and non-current positions to reflect the maturity of long-dated interest rate swaps.
