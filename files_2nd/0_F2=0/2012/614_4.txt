and the overall market for electronic Unlike EMSs, who usually manufacture products was estimated at $1,650bn.
ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY from a near-final design provided by their OEM customers, ODMs sell fully Our products broadly t within the The principal end-market for Alent is designed products for OEMs and then fabrication materials, packaging materials, global electronics production, which manufacture them.
ODMs are a relative interconnect materials and assembly accounts for approximately three-quarters newcomer to the industry.
They have their materials segments and Prismark estimates of our revenue.
We supply electronic roots in designing and manufacturing these sub-sectors to be worth $24bn, component manufacturers and assemblers, low-end notebook PCs: and $13bn, $20bn and $6bn, respectively.
who, in turn, supply the electronic Original Equipment Manufacturers { equipment manufacturers and suppliers.
In the electronics market, there is a strong OEMs : companies such as IBM, trend towards increased connectivity Intel, Nokia and Samsung who design, It is also important to understand where and portability in consumer electronics.
