Onerous leases relate to sublet and vacant properties.
Where the rent receivable on the properties is less than the rent payable, a provision based on present value of the net cost is made to cover the expected shortfall.
The lease commitments range from one to 61 years.
Market conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made where necessary.
Other property provisions comprise petrol filling station decommissioning reserve and dilapidations cost.
Provision is made for decommissioning costs for when the petrol filling station tanks reach the end of their useful life or when they become redundant and is based on the present value of costs to be incurred to decommission the petrol tanks.
Dilapidation costs are incurred to bring a leased building back to the condition in which it was originally leased.
Provision is made for these costs, which are incurred on termination of the lease.
