Included within the provision is 183,000 in respect of possible recourse on leases transferred to the purchaser on the sale of the Belgian operation.
Provisions reversed during the year relate to leases which have been successfully exited on more favourable terms than previously anticipated.
The key area of uncertainty relates to the net future rental costs to be incurred on vacated properties and, in particular, whether the properties can be sublet until lease exit.
The provision assumes that subletting is unlikely in the current climate.
For shops, the provision is expected to be substantially utilised within three years such that the impact of discounting would not be material.
For bakeries, the period over which the provision will be utilised is less certain and the provision is discounted over an appropriate period.
