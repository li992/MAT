Reference to disclosures given elsewhere in the financial statements is included as appropriate.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining ultimate responsibility for them, has delegated to the finance function the authority for designing and operating processes that ensure the effective implementation of those objectives.
The overall objectives of the Board are to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the potential financial loss if a tenant or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Groups trade receivables from tenants.
Page 43 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued Trade receivables The majority of the Groups rental income is demanded quarterly in advance and demands are sent out prior to the due date.
Management monitors arrears continually and prompt action is taken to address potential defaults as appropriate.
The credit worthiness of each tenant is assessed prior to the agreement of the lease.
Collateral is generally required by the Group to support lease obligations.
In many cases this takes the form of a tenant security deposit but also includes parent company guarantees or bank or other guarantees where appropriate.
Provision is made on a sliding scale against any rental arrears where recovery is in doubt or where solicitors have been instructed to recover the debt, with full provision for impairment usually being made where a tenant is in arrears for more than a year.
Details of the Groups trade receivables and the extent of impairment provisions against them are set out in Note 11.
Due to the large number of tenants across various sectors and geographical locations, the Board does not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk.
Cash and derivative financial instruments The credit rating of counterparties to financial instruments is kept under review, particularly in the current economic conditions.
The Groups interest rate swaps are currently significantly out-of-the - money: consequently, counterparty risk on swaps does not represent a major risk at the current time.
The counterparty risk on cash and short-term deposits is managed by limiting the aggregate exposure to any institution by reference to their credit rating.
Such balances are generally placed with major financial institutions where credit risk is not considered significant.
Maximum exposure The aggregate carrying amounts of the Groups financial assets, which are stated net of impairment provisions, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking into account the value of the tenant security deposits held and other collateral.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Groups management of its working capital and the finance charges and amortisation of its loans and borrowings.
The Groups policy is to seek to maintain cash balances to meet all short and medium term requirements.
The Group has a low level of gearing relative to the property investment sector as a whole and has long standing relationships with many leading banks and financial institutions from which the Board expect to be able to raise further funds if required.
At 31 March 2012, gearing was 16.9 per cent.
on the basis of gross debt to gross assets.
Cash and short-term deposits at 31 March 2012, were 32.5 million 2011 30.6 million, after adjusting for 41.0 of short-term borrowings temporarily held as cash at the year end and 18.1 million of loans and borrowing were repayable within one year 2011 14.2 million, after adjusting for the same shortterm borrowings.
In addition, at the same date, the Group had undrawn committed facilities of 64.6 million 2011 30.6 million.
Of this, 61.6 million expires in 2015 and 3.0 million in 2018.
Page 44 Daejan Holdings PLC Report & Financial Statements 2012 The maturity analysis of the undiscounted cash flows arising from the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2012 was as follows: Aggregate Due Due Due Due after Carrying undiscounted within within within more than amount cash flows one year 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans 53,431 53,431 1,525 1,375 4,125 46,406 Mortgages 177,745 159,266 12,839 12,292 61,886 72,249 Interest 54,306 9,158 8,407 19,106 17,635 Interest rate swaps 6,149 7,572 1,141 1,141 3,422 1,868 Trade and other payables 38,379 38,379 38,379 275,704 312,954 63,042 23,215 88,539 138,158 Market risk Market risk arises mainly from the impact that changes in interest rates might have on the cost of Group borrowing and the impact that changes in the US$ exchange rate might have on the Groups USA net assets.
Interest rates The Group seeks to reduce the interest rate risk by fixing rates on a majority of its loans and borrowings, whilst maintaining some loans at floating rates in order to retain flexibility in relation to short term interest rates.
Interest rates are fixed either through the use of fixed rate mortgage finance or through interest rate swaps.
The Group does not speculate in treasury products but uses these only to limit exposure to potential interest rate fluctuations.
The interest rate profile of the Groups loans and borrowings is set out in Note 16.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before taxation by approximately 0.3 million, after taking account of the interest swaps in place.
There also exists a risk to the income statement arising from the recognition and re-measurement of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps at fair value.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would give rise to a reduction in fair value of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps of 9.4 million.
Interest rate swaps The interest rate swaps held by the Group at the year end were as follows: Contracted rate excluding margin Notional principal Fair value 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Per cent.
