Financial instruments continued C. Liquidity Risk Being the risk that an entity will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
These risks and the policies for managing them have been applied throughout the year and are summarised below.
Further detail is contained in the Business Review Investment Policy section on page 22.
Market Risk i other Price Risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the corporate objective.
Securities held by the Company are valued at bid prices, whereas material unlisted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of the latest information in line with the relevant principles of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines Accounting Policy b.
These valuations also represent the fair value of the investments, see note 9 on pages 43 and 44.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 16 to 20.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a review of the 20 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value, are shown on pages 12 to 15.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity 29.9% of the Companys equity investments at 31 December 2012 2011 33.6% were listed on the main list of the London Stock Exchange and a further 38.0% 2011 31.6% on AIM.
The NASDAQ Stock Exchange accounts for 20.9% 2011 24.2% and other stock exchanges 8.3% 2011 9.2%.
A 10% increase in stock prices at 31 December 2012 would have increased total net assets and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 51,100,000 2011 46,200,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The portfolio does not target any exchange as a comparative index, and the performance of the portfolio has a low correlation to generally used indices.
The shares of Herald Investment Trust plc have an underlying NAV per share.
The NAV per share of Herald Investment Trust plc fluctuates on a daily basis.
In addition, there is volatility in the discount premium the share price has to NAV.
ii Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Companys assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
However, the Company does hold Convertible Bonds and Government Securities, the interest rate and maturity dates of which are detailed below.
Interest is accrued on sterling cash balances at a rate linked to the UK base rate.
The aim of the use of gearing is to enhance long term returns to shareholders by investing borrowed funds in equities and other assets.
How and where borrowings are invested is reviewed by the Board in consultation with the Manager at every Board meeting.
In light of the decisions made, appropriate adjustments to the gearing position are then made by the Manager.
At the year end the Company had borrowings of 50 million 2011 50 million.
Under the terms of an interest rate swap, the interest payable on the bank loans has been fixed.
The interest rate risk profile of the financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December was: Financial Assets 2012 2011 2012 Weighted 2011 Weighted Weighted average Weighted average average period average period 2012 interest until 2011 interest until Fair rate maturity Fair rate maturity value interest maturity value interest maturity 000 rate date 000 rate date Fixed rate: UK bonds 17,816 4.7% 4 years 16,445 4.9% 5 years Euro bonds 14,015 5.0% 4 years 9,791 4.4% 6 years UK convertible bonds 729 7.5% 2 years 1,162 7.5% 3 years Cash: Other overseas currencies 6,341 1,762 Sterling 22,609 0.7% 28,259 0.3% 28,950 30,021 48 notes to tHe FInAnCIAL stAteMents continued 20.
Financial instruments continued ii Interest Rate Risk continued The cash deposits generally comprise call or short term money market deposits with original maturities of less than 3 months which are repayable on demand.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on cash balances is the bank base rate.

The Companys facilities are rolling on a quarterly basis with the facilities expiring in May 2013.
While the 30 year swap remains in place, the net interest payable will effectively be fixed for the duration of the term of the loan facilities.

Based on the position at 31 December 2012, over a full year, an increase of 100 basis points would have increased the net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 290,000 2011 300,000 and would have increased the net asset value per share by 0.36p 2011 0.38p.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
b Fixed rate bonds An increase of 100 basis points in bond yields as at 31 December 2012 would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 980,000 2011 817,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 1.24p 2011 1.02p.
A decrease in bond yields would have had an equal and opposite effect.
The Convertible loan stocks having an element of equity are not included in this analysis as given the nature of the businesses and the risk profile of the balance sheets they are considered to have more equity like characteristics.
c Bank loans The effect of an increase or decrease of 100 basis points in 3 month LIBOR interest rates as at 31 December 2012 on the interest cost of the bank loans and the net income return has been eliminated through a 30 year floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap.
The swap generates payments or charges that offset changes in the 3 month LIBOR interest rate, so that the interest payable on the bank loans is effectively converted to a fixed rate loan at 4.8975% 2011 4.8975% plus margin cost.
The initial term of the swap on commencement at 30 years did not match the term of the loans, therefore, hedge accounting is not used and changes in the fair value of the swap are captured in the net return on ordinary activities as set out in d below.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk sensitivity continued d Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap A decrease of 100 basis points on 30 year interest rates as at 31 December 2012 would have a direct effect on the fair value of the swap and net assets.
Based on the position as at 31 December 2012, over a full year, a decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased the gains on investments and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 11,941,000 2011 12,020,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 15.05p 2011 15.08p.
An increase of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
iii Foreign Currency Risk The Companys reporting currency is sterling, but investments are made in overseas markets as well as the United Kingdom and the asset value can be affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Furthermore many companies trade internationally both through foreign subsidiaries, and through exports.
The greatest foreign currency risk occurs when companies have a divergence in currencies for costs and revenues.
A much less risky exposure to currency is straight translation of sales and profits.
The List of Investments on pages 16 to 20 breaks down the portfolio by geographic listing.
However the location of the stock market quote only has a limited correlation to the costs, revenues and even activities of those companies, and so this note should not be regarded as a reliable guide to the sensitivity of the portfolio to currency movements.
For example, the holdings in the portfolio that have suffered most from US$ weakness are UK companies with dollar revenues and sterling costs.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
Overseas income is subject to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not hedge these currency fluctuations because it is impossible to quantify the effect for the reasons stated above.
However, from time to time the Manager takes a view by holding financial assets or liabilities in overseas currencies.
Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation by currency of listing is indicated below: At 31 December 2012 Other debtors Cash and and Net Investments deposits Loans creditors exposure 000 000 000 000 000 US dollar 107,482 146 68 107,560 Norwegian krone 17,326 17,326 Korean won 14,609 26 14,635 Taiwan dollar 7,706 6,195 13,901 Euro 9,296 403 9,699 Other overseas currencies 6,974 6,974 Exposure to currency risk on translation of valuations of securities listed in overseas currencies 163,393 6,341 361 170,095 Sterling 379,749 22,609 50,000 20,507 331,851 543,142 28,950 50,000 20,146 501,946 Includes net non-monetary assets of 38,000.
