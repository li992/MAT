Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting year.
ShareRetirement Other based Capital benefit temporary million payments Allowances Losses obligations differences Total At 1 January 2011 300.0 68.3 3.3 371.6 Credit charge to income 10.2 18.6 0.3 28.5 Credit to equity 4.8 4.8 Disposal of subsidiaries 1.8 3.3 5.1 At 31 December 2011 289.8 52.7 0.3 342.8 8.1 Credit charge to income 2.4 41.8 10.8 2.1 40.0 Credit to equity 2.5 14.3 16.8 At 31 December 2012 4.9 8.1 248.0 56.2 2.4 319.6 Closing deferred tax on UK temporary differences has been calculated at the enacted rate of 23% 2011: 25%.
The effect of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 25% to 23% is a reduction in the net deferred tax asset at the end of 2012 of an amount of 26.0 million.
Of this 26.0 million, 4.9 million has been charged directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The proposed reduction in the main rate of corporation tax by 2% by 2014 is expected to be enacted in Finance Act 2013.
Based on the level of deferred tax recognised at the balance sheet date a charge of 13.9 million for each 1% reduction would arise.
The net deferred tax balance is analysed into assets and liabilities as follows: million 2012 2011 Deferred tax assets 319.6 342.8 Deferred tax liabilities 319.6 342.8 The Group has not recognised temporary differences relating to tax losses carried forward and other temporary differences amounting to 148.3 million 2011: 270.3 million in the UK and 93.8 million 2011: 82.2 million in Spain.
The UK losses have not been recognised as they are predominantly non trading in nature and sufficient uncertainty exists as to their utilisation.
The losses in Spain have not been recognised due to uncertainty of sufficient taxable profits existing against which to utilise the losses.
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused UK capital losses of 252.8 million 2011: 252.4 million, all of which are agreed as available for offset against future capital profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining capital losses at 31 December 2012 because the Group does not believe that it is probable that these capital losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Inventories million 2012 2011 Raw materials and consumables 0.8 1.2 Finished goods and goods for resale 29.2 17.9 Residential developments: a Land 2,051.0 2,018.9 Development and construction costs 704.9 643.8 Commercial, industrial and mixed development properties 2.9 4.8 2,788.8 2,686.6 a Details of land creditors are in Note 18.
The Directors consider all inventories to be current in nature.
The operational cycle is such that the majority of inventory will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised, as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
In the year 46% 2011: 63% of the Groups completions in the UK were from sites that had been previously impaired.
As at 31 December 2012, 26% 2011: 39% of our UK short term owned and controlled land is impaired.
The gross profit for the year includes 85.1 million 2011: 99.6 million of positive contribution, on completions from sites with previously impaired inventory.
The positive contribution is the estimation difference between the realised value on completions compared to the value assumed in the net realisable value review.

Inventories continued This is due to the actual selling prices and or costs on these completions being favourable to the estimates and market assumptions used in the net realisable value review.
This estimation difference is due to a combination of actions taken by the Group including cost reductions through replans, the implementation of standard house types and slightly higher selling prices.
Whilst market conditions have stabilised in the United Kingdom the Group has not recorded any additional write-downs or reversals of previous write-downs to net realisable value as there is no clear evidence of a sustained change in the housing market and wider economic circumstances at the balance sheet date.
At the balance sheet date the Group had inventory that had been written down to net realisable value of 834.4 million 2011: 1,129.2 million.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables of 5.4 million 2011: 5.5 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Shared equity loans are provided to certain customers.
These are separated into a host contract representing a loan receivable and a nonclosely related embedded derivative asset for accounting purposes as allowed under IAS 39 Financial instruments.
The loan is measured at amortised cost less any provision for default and the embedded derivative is measured at fair value through the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents million 2012 2011 Cash and cash equivalents see Note 19 190.4 147.7 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.

Financial instruments Capital management The Groups objective is to obtain a strong credit rating for the business and to have an appropriate funding structure based on maintaining a minimum interest cover and within a maximum level of gearing adjusted for land creditors.
Shareholders equity and long term debt are used to finance fixed assets and medium to long term land bank.
Revolving credit facilities are used to fund net current assets including development and construction costs.

The fair values of the forward contracts are not material as they were entered into on or near 31 December in each year and mature not more than one month later.
Profit loss before tax has been arrived at after charging crediting the following gains and losses: million 2012 2011 Change in fair value of financial liabilities designated as effective hedged items Change in fair value of derivatives designated as effective hedging instruments Change in fair value of derivatives classified as held for trading 1.5 1.5 Market risk The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in both foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group aims to manage the exposure to these risks by the use of fixed or variable rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
a Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at both fixed and variable interest rates.
The exposure to variable rate borrowings varies during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash flows relating to housing sales and the less certain timing of land payments.
Group policy is to manage the volatility risk by a combination of fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps such that the sensitivity to potential changes in variable rates is within acceptable levels.
Group policy does not allow the use of derivatives to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they are only used to manage exposure to volatility.
The policy has been updated since 2011 year end as a result of the continued low level of borrowings in relation to net assets of the Group.
co. uk 85 Directors Report: Business Review p02-27 Directors Report: Governance p28-60 Financial Statements p61-111 Shareholder Information p112-121 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 19.
Financial instruments continued In order to measure the risk, variable rate borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a monthly basis and compared to budget using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
At the year end the Group had 149.4 million 2011: 200.0 million of fixed rate exposure.
Hedge accounting Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with Group policy.
The Group had one interest rate swap which matured during the year and there are no swaps outstanding at the year end.
In 2011 the swap did not satisfy the strict requirements for hedge accounting and was therefore designated as held for trading.
A forward contract is currently being used to hedge the net investment risk in the Spanish operations.
Interest rate sensitivity The effect on both income and equity, based on exposure to non-derivative floating rate instruments at the balance sheet date, is shown in the table below.
For derivatives the fair values have been calculated based on rates available from a recognised financial information provider adjusted for the specified sensitivity.
The table assumes all other variables remain constant and in accordance with IFRS 7 does not attempt, for example, to include the effects of any resultant change in exchange rates.

The Group completed the sale of its North American business in July 2011 and Spain is the only remaining overseas business.
The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as all Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional currencies.
Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk of accounting for both the income and the net investment held in functional currencies other than Sterling.
The net investment risk is partially hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest exchange rates and resultant exchange gains or losses monitored each month.
Income is also measured monthly using the latest exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historical exchange rates.
Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency borrowings the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives.
The policy is kept under periodic review.
The Groups exposure to, and the way in which it manages, exchange rate risk has not changed from the previous year.
Hedge accounting The Group has designated the carrying value of 55.0 million 2011: 55.0 million foreign currency forward contracts as a net investment hedge of part of the Groups investment in Euro denominated assets.
The change in the carrying amount of the derivatives which were effective hedging instruments and the change in the carrying value of the borrowings offset the exchange movement on the foreign currency net investments and are presented in the translation reserve.

Group policy is that surplus cash when not used to repay borrowings is placed on deposit with the Groups main relationship banks and with other banks based on a minimum credit rating and maximum exposure.
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred terms.
A policy is in place such that if the credit risk is not acceptable then the deferred payment must have adequate security, either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land.
The fair value of any land held as security is considered by management to be sufficient in relation to the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing associations and other housebuilders.
Management considers that the credit quality of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
There is no significant concentration of risk.
A small allowance for credit losses against other debtors is held, however the balance is not material in relation to the gross carrying value of this particular class of financial asset.
Mortgages receivables, including shared equity, are in connection with the various promotion schemes to support sales on a selective basis.
The mortgages are mostly secured by a second charge over the property and are held at their carrying value.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows, matching the expected cash flow timings of financial assets and liabilities with the use of term cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities for a minimum of 12 months from maturity.
Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak requirements to meet unforeseen events.
The Group has a range of maturities with an average life of 2.2 years 2011: 3.2 years.
In addition to fixed term borrowings the Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities and cash balances.
At the balance sheet date, the total unused committed amount was 550.0 million 2011: 600.0 million and cash and cash equivalents were 190.4 million 2011: 147.7 million.
During 2012 the Group negotiated an option to extend the 100.0 million fixed term loan, for a further 5.5 years to mature November 2020.
This loan was originally due to mature in June 2015.
This extension is subject to redemption of the 10.375% Senior Notes due 2015, prior to 30 June 2015 of which 149.4 million currently remains outstanding.

Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligation comprises defined benefit pension liability of 242.5 million 2011: 208.2 million and post-retirement healthcare liability of 1.7 million 2011: 2.0 million.
The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
In the UK, the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund TWGP&LAF and the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme GWSPS are funded defined benefit schemes and are managed by boards of Trustees.
The TWGP&LAF was closed to future pension accrual with effect from 30 November 2006 and the GWSPS was closed to future accrual with effect from 31 August 2010.
An alternative defined contribution arrangement, the Taylor Wimpey Personal Choice Plan TWPCP, is offered to all new and existing monthly paid employees.
Future revaluation of deferred member benefits in the UK defined benefit schemes will be based on the Consumer Price Index in line with scheme rules.
Pensioner increases will continue to be based on Retail Price Index.
The pension scheme assets of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, TWGP&LAF and GWSPS, are held in separate trusteeadministered funds to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by each schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that at least one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the scheme.
The Trustees have agreed to hold Joint Trustee Board meetings to manage the schemes jointly, and where appropriate, they have also implemented a Joint Investment Sub Committee to manage the investment of the combined defined benefit scheme assets.
The Group and the Trustees have undertaken a review of the schemes investment strategy.
Implementation of the investment changes started during 2011 and monitoring of these changes is ongoing.
The most recent formal triennial valuations of the TWGP&LAF and the GWSPS were carried out as at 31 March 2010.
The Group agreed revised funding schedules under which the Group will make annual funding contributions of 22.0 million per annum in respect of the TWGP&LAF over 10 years from the valuation date and 24.0 million per annum in respect of the GWSPS over 10 years from the valuation date.
The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were taken into account using market values.
The Company has an agreement in principle with the Trustees to merge GWSPS and TWGP&LAF into a new scheme, the Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme, and members have been informed of the merger that is expected to complete in first half 2013 subject to regulatory guidance.
At the same time we are introducing a 100 million Pension Funding Partnership utilising show homes in a sale and leaseback structure.
This proposal will simplify scheme management, reduce administration costs by circa 0.8 million per annum and provide a way of managing future deficit repair contributions.
The new Taylor Wimpey Pension Scheme will benefit from a contingent Pension Funding Partnership structure, backed principally by show homes, should the Group be unable to meet the cash payments under the funding agreement.
Contributions of 7.1 million 2011: 6.6 million were charged to income in respect of defined contribution schemes.
The main financial assumptions, which were used for the triennial funding valuation and are all relative to the inflation assumption, are as set out below: Assumptions TWGP&LAF GWSPS RPI inflation 3.60% 3.85% Discount rate pre post-retirement 6.85%-5.10% 6.75%-4.75% General pay inflation Real pension increases 0.00% 0.00% Valuation results TWGP&LAF GWSPS Market value of assets 758m 694m Past service liabilities 1,022m 953m Scheme funding levels 74% 73% Taylor Wimpey plc plc.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The results of the March 2010 valuations of the Groups pension schemes have been updated to 31 December 2012.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: United Kingdom 2012 2011 As at 31 December Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.30% 4.90% Expected return on scheme assets 5.13%-5.70% 5.04%-5.43% General pay inflation n a n a Deferred pension increases 1.80% 1.95% Pension increases 1.90%-3.50% 2.00%-3.55% The basis for the above assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reflect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the Groups pension schemes.
The current life expectancies in years underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK plans are: 2012 2011 Life expectancy Male Female Male Female Member currently age 65 87 90 87 90 Member currently age 45 88 92 88 92 The life expectancies have been derived using mortality assumptions that were based on the results of a recent investigation into the mortality experience of the schemes.
The base tables used are the PA92 series tables with appropriate age rating adjustments.
Future improvements in life expectancy are allowed for in the form of the medium cohort projections, with a 1% per annum underpin to future improvements in life expectancy.
The fair value of assets and present value of obligations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are set out below: Expected rate Percentage of of return total plan % p. a million assets held 31 December 2012 Assets: Equities 7.50% 762.8 43% Bonds 4.10% 540.9 31% Gilts 3.00% 653.2 37% a Other assets 2.65%-7.50% 186.4 11% 1,770.5 Present value of defined benefit obligations 2,013.0 Deficit in schemes recognised as non-current liability 242.5 31 December 2011 Assets: Equities 7.45% 641.8 38% Bonds 4.70% 428.3 26% Gilts 2.95% 459.2 27% Other assets 2.80%-7.45% 151.3 9% 1,680.6 100% Present value of defined benefit obligations 1,888.8 Deficit in schemes recognised as non-current liability 208.2 a Includes repurchase agreements and other financial derivatives shown as a negative asset, used as part of a diversified portfolio for hedging purposes and to support other asset classes.
To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on investments particularly government bonds and the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested.
The expectations for future returns of each asset class were then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Retirement benefit schemes continued The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial period for returns over the life of the related obligation.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government.
The risk of default on these is very small.
The trustees also hold bonds issued by public companies.
There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies.
The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity investments.
The investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered riskier investments.
Similarly, the trustees have holdings in alternative investments which are also considered riskier investments but are intended to reduce the overall risk of the portfolio by introducing greater diversification.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium, the equity risk premium, to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.
A summary of the target asset allocations of the major defined benefit schemes is shown below: TWGP&LAF GWSPS UK Equities 7.6% 5.3% Non-UK Equities 30.4% 21.2% Index-Linked Gilts 9.4% 20.3% Fixed-Interest Gilts 5.1% 8.7% Other bonds 25.0% 25.5% Alternatives GTAA: Opportunistic credit: EMD: Active commodities 20.5% 19.0% Property 2.0% million 2012 2011 Amount charged against income: a Settlement loss 4.0 Operating loss 4.0 Expected return on scheme assets 79.0 82.3 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 88.9 96.4 Finance charges 9.9 14.1 Total charge 9.9 18.1 a The settlement for 2011 is in relation to an enhanced transfer value exercise.

The Group liability is the difference between the scheme liabilities and the scheme assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the scheme liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value of the assets so there is no net effect on the Group liability.
