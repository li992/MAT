For some properties, the provision is based on the shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable.
For other properties, where negotiations to surrender the lease are in progress, the provision is based on the amount which the landlord has indicated that they are willing to take as a premium in order for the Group to surrender the lease.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group considers that it can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning, or surrendering the lease.
Throughout the course of the period the Group reviews the range of options for unused properties, and maintains ongoing discussions with landlords and external agents, with a view to identifying possible lease surrenders and nding tenants.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.2m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
The amount of the expected future cash ows has been adjusted to reect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outows under this provision are expected to take place over a number or years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
The timing of outows from the provision is variable dependent on property lease expiry dates and also on opportunities to surrender leases.
