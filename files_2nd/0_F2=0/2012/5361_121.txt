Watercryl was established in 1993 and is a leading supplier of additives to the Brazilian coatings industry, with manufacturing and technical facilities based in Palmital, So Paulo.
Transaction costs and expenses totalling $0.9 million have been charged to the income statement.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Provisional fair Fair value of Book value at value assets acquisition adjustments acquired $million $million $million Property, plant and equipment 0.5 14.5 15.0 Inventories 1.5 1.5 Trade and other receivables 1.9 0.2 1.7 Trade and other payables 0.5 0.1 0.6 Cash and cash equivalents 0.4 0.4 Loans and borrowings Corporation tax Deferred tax Goodwill 4.4 Intangible 2.0 Consideration paid, satisfied in cash 24.4 Cash acquired 0.4 Net cash outow 24.0 A full fair value process is currently being performed with the assistance of external experts and will be completed during the first half of 2013, as allowed by IFRS 3.
This allows for the allocation period to remain open for a period of up to 12 months from the acquisition date.
Prior to acquisition, the accounting for Watercryl had been conducted on a basis appropriate for a privately run business operating under local Brazilian generally accepted accounting principles.
The initial financial focus post acquisition has been to concentrate on operational issues but the formal valuation process will allow an accurate assessment to be made of the realisable value of the assets acquired, measured under International Financial Reporting Standards, as at the date of acquisition.
A provisional fair valuing exercise has been performed for the 2012 Annual Report using book values at the acquisition date together with a provisonal assessment of fair value adjustments that may be required.
The consideration for the acquisition has been allocated against identied net assets with the remaining balance recorded as goodwill and intangibles.
The goodwill recognised on acquisition reects both the capabilities of the Watercryls personnel and the synergistic opportunities going forward, neither of which can be allocated to an identiable intangible asset.
Since acquisition Watercryl has contributed $2.5 million to the Groups revenue and $0.2 million to the Groups operating profit before intangible amortisation.
