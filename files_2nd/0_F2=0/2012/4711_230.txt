m Capital management Diageo considers the following components of its balance sheet to be capital: borrowings, banks overdrafts and equity.
The groups management is committed to enhancing shareholder value in the long term, both by investing in the businesses and brands so as to improve the return on investment and by managing the capital structure.
Diageo manages its capital structure to achieve capital efficiency, maximise flexibility and give the appropriate level of access to debt markets at attractive cost levels.
This is achieved by targeting a range of ratios which are currently broadly consistent with an A band credit rating.
Diageo would consider modifying these ratios in order to effect strategic initiatives within its stated goals, which could have an impact on its rating.
The group regularly assesses its debt and equity capital levels against its stated policy for capital structure.
Where appropriate, comparative figures were reclassified to ensure a consistent presentation with current year information.
