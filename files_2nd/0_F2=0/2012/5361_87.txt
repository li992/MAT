Additional tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised and for which there is no expiry date were $4.4 million 2011: $4.2 million.
These relate to restricted losses within the UK and have reduced in the year due to the restructuring within subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
There are no significant temporary differences arising in connection with interests in subsidiaries and associates.
