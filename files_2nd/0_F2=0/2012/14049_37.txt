Serco has limited commercial risk in relation to the contract specic schemes, due either to the right of cost reimbursement or because the deficit will, in general, pass back to the customer or on to the next contractor at the end of the contract.
Among our non contract specic schemes, the largest is SPLAS.
At 31 December 2012, SPLAS had a surplus of 69.7m 2011: surplus of 122.3m.
This is calculated under IAS 19 using market-derived rates at 31 December 2012.
It therefore reects the effect of the market conditions through the actual investment returns in the year and the impact of an increase in ination assumptions and a decrease in the applicable discount rate.
The estimated actuarial deficit of SPLAS as at 31 December 2012 was approximately 10.9m 2011: 27.3m.
The value calculated in the latest triennial review was a deficit of 141m at 6 April 2009.
We continue to review the level of benets and contributions under the scheme in the light of our business needs and changes to pension legislation.
Retirement benefit obligations reduced by 50.5m as a result of the disposal of Serco GmbH.
The acquisition of Vertex Public Services Limited included the acquisition of 13.4m of net retirement benefit obligations as at 11 June 2012.
Figure 6 shows the sensitivity of the liabilities of our pension schemes to changes in discount rates and to adjustments in the actuarial assumptions for the rate of ination, members salary increases and life expectancies.

Treasury The Groups committed bank credit facilities total 730.0m 2011: 726.7m.
As at 31 December 2012, 177.6m had been drawn down on bank facilities 2011: 241.3m.
The bank facility is solely comprised of a 730.0m syndicated revolving credit facility, which matures in March 2017.
It was signed in March 2012 and replaced all existing committed bank credit facilities.
In addition to the bank credit facility, Serco has US private placements totalling 460.8m which will be repaid between 2013 and 2023.
All of the Groups credit facilities detailed above are unsecured.
Going concern The Directors have acknowledged the guidance Going Concern and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009 and An update for Directors of Listed Companies: Responding to Increased Country and Currency Risk in Financial Reports, published by the Financial Reporting Council in October 2009 and January 2012 respectively.
Whilst the current economic environment remains uncertain, the broad base of our contract portfolio and with over 90% of our customers being government bodies, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Groups revenues are largely derived from long-term contracts with governments.
Historically, these contracts have been relatively resilient to changes in the general economy.
The contract portfolio is diverse and a downturn in any particular market, sector or geography has a more limited effect on the Group as a whole.
In addition, with an order book of 19.1bn and high visibility of future revenue streams 92% in 2013: 79% in 2014 and 70% in 2015, the Group is well placed to manage its business risks despite the current uncertain economic climate.
As at 31 December 2012, the Groups principal nancing is through a revolving credit facility and US private placements.
The Group has approximately 1,191m of committed credit facilities.
The headroom on the facilities was approximately 552m as at 31 December 2012.
Scheduled repayments in 2013 in respect of US private placement maturities are 23.4m in August.
The revolving credit facility matures in March 2017 whilst repayments of the US private placements occur between 2013 and 2023.
The Group fully expects to meet these repayments through operational cash ows.
Based on the information set out above, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.
