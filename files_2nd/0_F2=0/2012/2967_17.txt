At November 30, 2012, minimum amounts payable for our operating leases, with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year, and for the annual usage of port facilities and other contractual commitments with remaining terms in excess of one year, were as follows in millions : Fiscal 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter Total Operating leases................. $ 43 $ 41 $ 38 $ 34 $ 25 $179 $ 360 Port facilities and other............ 135 127 121 113 105 678 1,279 $178 $168 $159 $147 $130 $857 $1,639 NOTE 7 CostaConcordia During 2012, we wrote-off the net carrying value of the ship in the amount of 381 million or $515 million and received 395 million or $508 million of hull and machinery insurance proceeds for the total loss of the ship.
As a result, in 2012 we recognized 14 million or $17 million of proceeds in excess of the net carrying value of the ship as a reduction of other ship operating expenses.
In addition, during 2012 we incurred $28 million for ship incident-related expenses that were not covered by insurance, including a $10 million insurance deductible related to third party personal injury liabilities.
These ship incident-related expenses are principally included in other ship operating expenses.
As a result of the ship incident, litigation claims, enforcement actions, regulatory actions and investigations, including, but not limited to, those arising from personal injury, loss of life, loss of or damage to personal property, business interruption losses or environmental damage to any affected coastal waters and the surrounding areas, have been and may be asserted or brought against various parties, including us.
The existing assertions are in their initial stages and there are significant jurisdictional uncertainties.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
However, we do not expect these matters to have a significant impact on our results of operations because we have insurance coverage for these types of third-party claims.
Since the ship incident, we have separately presented short-term insurance recoverables and short-term claims reserve in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At November 30, 2012, substantially all of our aggregated shortterm and long-term insurance recoverables relate to crew, guest and other third party claims for the ship incident.
At November 30, 2012, primarily all of our aggregated short-term and long-term claims reserves also relate to the ship incident.
At November 30, 2012 and 2011, our long-term insurance recoverables and long-term claims reserve are included in other assets and other long-term liabilities, respectively, and are not material.
NOTE 8 Contingencies Litigation In the normal course of our business, various claims and lawsuits have been filed or are pending against us.
Most of these claims and lawsuits are covered by insurance and, accordingly, the maximum amount of our liability, net of any insurance recoverables, is typically limited to our self-insurance retention levels.
Management believes the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 7 for a discussion of loss contingencies related to the ship incident.
Contingent Obligations Lease Out and Lease Back Type LILO Transactions At November 30, 2012, Carnival Corporation had estimated contingent obligations totaling $429 million, excluding termination payments as discussed below, to participants in LILO transactions for two of its ships.
At the inception of these leases, the aggregate of the net present value of these obligations was paid by Carnival Corporation to a group of major financial institutions, who agreed to act as payment undertakers and directly pay 20
