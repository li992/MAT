Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements C1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRSs.
Accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the current and preceding periods.
After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections, the directors are satisfied that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Companys accounting policies in relation to operating leases, share-based payments, translation of foreign currencies, property, plant & equipment, taxation and derivative financial instruments are set out in note 1 to the Group financial statements.
Other accounting policies which are specic to the Company are set out below.
a Share-based payments Where the Company has granted rights to its equity to employees of subsidiary undertakings in relation to equity-settled, share-based payment arrangements the contribution to the subsidiary undertakings is recognised as an additional investment.
b Investments Investments are stated at cost, less any provision for impairment in value.
c Post-retirement benets It is not practical to allocate the underlying assets and liabilities of the dened benefit section of the pension scheme to the Company on a consistent and reasonable basis.

The Companys contributions to the dened contribution section of the pension scheme are charged to the income statement on an accruals basis as they become payable.

126 Dixons Retail plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 12 Financial Statements C11 Post-retirement benets The Company maintains a pension scheme for eligible employees in the UK comprising both a dened benefit and dened contribution section.
The dened benefit section is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualied actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1 September 2002, the dened benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the dened contribution section being offered to those active members of the dened benefit section at that time.
Membership of the dened contribution section is offered to all eligible employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
The recovery plan based on this valuation commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million, which rose to 16.0 million in 2011 12 and will rise to 20.0 million for 2012 13 and 2013 14, rising approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 31 March 2013.
At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benets accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
The valuation of the dened benefit section for the purposes of IAS 19 showed a gross pension deficit before deferred tax of 261.9 million 2011 244.0 million and 2010 263.5 million.
Further particulars of the scheme are disclosed in note 21 to the Group financial statements.

128 Dixons Retail plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 12 Financial Statements e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in interest rates on derivative financial instruments and certain monetary items.
The sensitivity analysis reects the position as at 28 April 2012 and 30April2011 respectively, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in interest rates affect the Companys loss before tax, mainly due to the impact of oating rate borrowings, cash and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys principal oating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR.
The following sensitivity analysis shows a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant and the corresponding decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on profit before tax and equity of 6.1 million 2010 11 a 5.9 million negative effect on profit before tax and equity.
Assumptions used in calculating the sensitivity analysis are set out in note 22 e to the Group financial statements.
