Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2012 the total of such gains was 175 million 2011: 206 million and the potential tax effect before the offset of losses was 40 million 2011: 52 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
At 31 December 2012, the value of such completed development properties was nil 2011: 217 million and the potential tax charge that would arise if these properties were to be sold was nil 2011: nil.
E: UK REIT status The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years after completion of development.
The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Groups exempted net income.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activity and its balance of business.
The Group continues to meet these conditions.
F: French SIIC status Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then designate UK dividends paid to its shareholders as SIIC distributions.
Dividend obligations will arise principally after property disposals but for the Hammerson Group there will be a period of around four years after a disposal for dividends to be paid to shareholders.
Outstanding SIIC dividend obligations arising on disposals and earnings prior to 31 December 2012 amount to 80 million 2011: 127 million and are expected to be settled within dividends paid by Hammerson plc over the following four years.
A further 265 million 2011: 281 million of dividends would be payable if the properties were realised at their 31 December 2012 values.
Since 1 July 2009, qualifying foreign dividends have been exempt from UK tax and therefore no deferred tax provision is recognised.
If Hammerson plc ceased to qualify as a French SIIC before 1 January 2014, tax penalties of 132 million 2011: 163 million would be payable.
To continue to qualify, at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment and, with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of the shares.

4.0 pence per share will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax if applicable, and the remainder of 6.0 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend.
There will be no scrip alternative.
The aggregate amount of the 2012 final dividend is 71.3 million.
This has been calculated using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2012.
The interim dividend of 7.7 pence per share was paid on 5 October 2012, as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate.

Other additions comprise 4.7 million preferred returns previously recognised in receivables and 10.5 million of advanced distributions for which the liability was previously included within investments but which is now recognised within other non-current payables.
Prior to 21 August 2012, the Group had concluded that it did not have significant influence over any of the investments in Value Retail PLC and associated entities as, despite holding certain limited voting rights, the Group had no means to influence financial and operating policies through its voting rights or otherwise.
The interests were therefore classified as available for sale investments.
On 21 August 2012, the Group acquired additional stakes in the sponsor entities of Bicester Investors Limited Partnership, Bicester Investors II LP, VR European Holdings BV and Value Retail PLC, increasing its interest in these Value Retail holding companies to 22%.
These investments have been equity accounted from the date of acquisition of the additional stakes, and disclosed as Investment in Associate see note 14, as the Group has significant influence through its ownership interest from this date.
In addition to the interests in the holding companies, the Group has non-equity interests of differing proportions in the entities which own VRs outlet Villages.
When aggregated the Groups share of VRs operating profit before other net gains amounts to 29.1% for the period ended 31 December 2012.

Variable rate borrowings bear interest based on LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR.
112 HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 Strategic review Governance Financial statements Notes to the accounts Other information 22: Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of these issues is set out in Risk Management on page 38.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A: Debt management The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
B: Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had interest rate swaps of 60.7 million 2011: 60.7 million and 40.0 million 2011: 41.2 million, maturing in 2015 and 2016 respectively.
Under these swaps the Group pays interest at fixed rates of 2.455% and 3.075% respectively and receives interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The Group also had interest rate swaps of 250.0 million 2011: nil maturing in 2020 under which the Group pays interest linked to LIBOR and receives interest at 6.875%.
At 31 December 2011 the Group also had interest rate swaps of 100 million which were cancelled during 2012.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of interest rate swaps was an asset of 11.6 million 2011: 10.6 million liability.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C: Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro denominated bonds and currency swaps, as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2012 was 790.1 million 2011: 583.8 million and their fair value was 841.4 million 2011: 604.1 million.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had currency swaps of 347.7 million, being 58.5 million sold forward against sterling for value in January 2013 at a rate of 1 1.227 and 379.6 million of cross currency swaps to swap the 300.0 million, 5.25% sterling bond maturing in 2016 into euro at a rate of 1 1.265 and a coupon of 4.76%.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had currency swaps of 476.2 million, being 552.0 million sold forward against sterling: 372.0 million for value in March 2012, at a rate of 1 1.162 and 180.0 million for value in June 2012, at a rate of 1 1.146.
The fair value of currency swaps is shown in note 22I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity.
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial Review on pages 44 to 45.
E: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity while maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 22A above.
F: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents HAMMERSON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 113 Strategic review Governance Financial statements Notes to the accounts Other information Notes to the accounts continued 22: Financial instruments and risk management continued payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2012 was 8.2 years 2011: 8.4 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account, the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Financial review on page 47.
Loans receivable and other receivables include balances due from joint venture partners, available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 17 and 18 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 18.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 237.5 million 2011: 268.1 million.
G: Financial maturity analysis The following table is a maturity analysis for income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities.

Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2012, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups annual profit before tax by 15.3 million 2011: increase of 2.8 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 16.3 million 2011: decrease of 4.4 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The decrease in the Groups annual profit before tax in 2011 following a reduction in interest rates is due to the charge arising on the change in fair value of interest rate swaps being greater than the saving arising from floating rate borrowings.
It is estimated that, in relation to financial instruments alone, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2012 by 109.4 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2012 by 133.8 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity by 95.0 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity by 116.1 million.
However, these effects would be more than offset by the effect of exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the Groups financial statements.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at the year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
I: Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of borrowings, currency and interest rate swaps, together with their carrying amounts included in the balance sheet, are as follows: 2012 2011 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Borrowings, excluding currency swaps 2,091.6 2,381.1 2,079.9 2,229.6 Currency swaps 11.1 11.1 15.0 15.0 Total 2,102.7 2,392.2 2,064.9 2,214.6 Interest rate swaps 11.6 11.6 10.6 10.6 Financial instruments associated with assets held for sale included in above table Borrowings, excluding currency swaps 64.6 64.6 Interest rate swaps 3.0 3.0 At 31 December 2012, the fair value of financial instruments exceeded their book value by 289.5 million 2011: 149.7 million, equivalent to 41 pence per share 2011: 21 pence per share on an EPRA net asset value per share basis.
The increase, compared with 31 December 2011 principally reflected the increase in the market values of the Companys bonds caused by a reduction in yields and underlying interest rates.
During the year floating rate reset bonds of 100 million nominal value were redeemed at fair value of 141.7 million, resulting in an exceptional finance cost of 41.7 million which is included in net finance costs note 7.
