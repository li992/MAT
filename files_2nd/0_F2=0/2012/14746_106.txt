The return on equities is 3.7% per annum in excess of the yield on government bonds.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out within this note.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation at 31 March 2012.
The actual return on Pension Scheme assets is as follows: Consolidated Company 2012 2011 2012 2011 m m m m Actual return on Pension Scheme assets 198.5 156.6 123.0 91.0 History of experience gains and losses Consolidated Company 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 m m m m m m m m m m Total actuarial gains and losses and gains recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income before adjustment for taxation 232.9 109.1 383.0 359.0 185.0 68.8 92.3 161.6 188.4 146.3 Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities 17.3 52.7 59.8 0.8 50.6 6.2 26.9 49.7 Experience gains losses on scheme assets 51.1 14.7 394.1 412.2 153.4 53.4 23.1 200.4 190.0 31.2 The cumulative actuarial losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income before adjustment for taxation since the adoption of IAS 19 is 997.2m losses 2011 836.1m.
