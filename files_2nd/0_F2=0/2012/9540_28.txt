01 Lonmin Explained 02 Directors Report Business Review 03 Directors Report Governance 04 Financial Statements 05 Shareholder Information Lonmin Plc [ 157] Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Reserves & Resources Revisions to the South African Mineral Resource estimates were confined to the Marikana, Limpopo and Pandora properties.
The Akanani and Loskop Mineral Resources were unchanged during 2012.
The Mineral Resources at Marikana excluding tailings decreased by 0.5 Moz of 3PGE Au in 2012.
Although mining depletion accounted for significantly more than this amount, it was mostly offset by a slightly lower assessment of geological losses applied to the 2012 Mineral Resource models.
Exploration drilling at Marikana in 2012 was focused on infill drilling that allows for a more accurate assessment of the Mineral Resource, rather than Mineral Resource extension.
A re-assessment of the structure of the Marikana Mineral Resource resulted in the re-classification of an area of high geological complexity from Indicated Resources to Inferred Resources.
A comprehensive assessment of one of the UG2 tailings dams on the Marikana property has allowed for declaration of a Mineral Resource of 0.8 Moz of 3PGE Au.
A major revision of the Pandora Mineral Resource was completed following a large drilling programme conducted in 2011 and a number of smaller drilling programmes conducted since 2008.
The Mineral Resource increased by 30%, with the addition of 2.3 Moz of 3PGE Au, and a large portion of the Inferred Mineral Resource was upgraded to Indicated Resources.
The Zebediela portion of the Inferred Mineral Resources at Limpopo was removed, accounting for a reduction of 2.8 Moz of 3PGE Au, due to surrendering of that portion of the prospecting right area.
No revisions were made to the Mineral Resources in Sudbury and Kenya during 2012.
The following revisions to the Marikana Mineral Reserve were made in 2012, there being no changes to the Limpopo Reserves: The overall UG2 and Merensky Reef Mineral Reserves decreased by 2.1 Moz of 3PGE Au, of which 1.0 Moz is attributed to mining depletion.
An area of Probable Mineral Reserve in the vicinity of the Elandsdrift Fault Zone was removed as the Mineral Resource was downgraded to Inferred Resource as a result of geological structural complexity.
Together with a re-assessment of mining of Merensky Reef affected by Iron Rich Ultramafic Pegmatite IRUP this reduced the Mineral Reserve by 2.0 Moz of 3PGE Au.
A number of additional areas were brought into the life-of-mine plan, which together with a re-assessment of certain modifying factors, increased the Mineral Reserve by 0.9 Moz.
The 3PGE Au grade for the combined Proved and Probable Mineral Reserves decreased by 1% 0.03 g t, which is due to slight revisions in modifying factors.
A summary of the changes to Lonmins Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves are shown in the following tables and should be read in conjunction with the Key Assumptions section of this report.
Detailed breakdowns of these Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves into their respective confidence categories can be found in the sections specific to the individual areas.
In 2011, Limpopo included the Mineral Resources for Zebedelia.
3 Loskop and Sudbury PGM JV exclude Rh, due to insufficient assays, and therefore 2PGE Au are reported.
Tailings Dam exclude Au, due to assay values below laboratory detection limit, and therefore are reported as 3PGE.
4 Resources are reported inclusive of Reserves.
5 Quantities and grades have been rounded to one or two decimal places, therefore minor computational errors may occur.

Key assumptions pertaining to the 2012 Lonmin Mineral Resource and Reserve Statement Mineral Resources are reported inclusive of Mineral Reserves.
Resources that are converted to Reserves are also included in the Mineral Resource statement.
All Resources and Reserves quoted reflect Lonmins attributable portion only.
There have been no changes in the percentage attributable to Lonmin during the year.
The following percentages were applied to the total Mineral Resource and Reserve for each property: Limpopo Limpopo Baobab & Sudbury Marikana Dwaalkop JV Doornvlei Akanani Pandora JV Loskop JV PGM JV Lonmin Attributable 82% 41% 82% 74% 34.85% 41% 50% Incwala Resources, Lonmins BEE partner, owns 18% of both Western Platinum Limited and Eastern Platinum Limited, and 26% of Akanani.
Lonmins 23.56% holding in the share capital of Incwala does not factor in the calculations of its attributable interest.
Limpopo includes Dwaalkop JV, which is a joint venture between Mvelaphanda Resources 50% and Western Platinum 50% that is managed by Lonmin.
Eastern Platinum Limited has an attributable interest of 42.5% in the Pandora Joint Venture together with Anglo Platinum 42.5%, Mvelaphanda Resources 7.5% and the Bapo Ba-Mogale Mining Company 7.5%.
Western Platinum Limited has an attributable interest of 50% in the Loskop Joint Venture together with Boynton Investments 50%.
Lonmins share of the Sudbury PGM JV is currently a nominal 50%, of the product from any PGE deposit developed on the participating properties.
The agreement is that Lonmin will be allocated its pro-rata share in PGEs and Vale will be allocated its pro-rata share in Nickel, Copper, Cobalt, Gold and Silver.
The exchange of metals will be governed by prevailing metal prices at the time of the refined metal production.
Lonmin has a 49% attributable portion of the Bumbo Mineral Resource in terms of The West Kenya earn-in and Joint Venture Agreement between Aviva Corporation Limited and AfriOre International Barbados Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Lonmin Plc.
Where grades are reported as 3PGE Au these are a summation of the Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium and Gold grades.
Modelling of available assay information, obtained from drillhole core, indicates that the proportion of 3PGE Au contained in 5PGE Au, which includes Ruthenium and Iridium, is approximately as follows: UG2 Merensky Platreef Marikana 0.81 0.92 Marikana Tailings 0.78 Limpopo 0.86 0.93 Akanani 0.95 Pandora 0.81 Where Nickel Ni and Copper Cu grade estimates are derived from sufficient reliable information for the various Mineral Resources, they are reported as average grades in percent.
These grades represent acid soluble proportions.
Acid soluble percentages of Ni and Cu are closely correlated to the metals present as sulphide minerals.
Mineral Resources are reported as in-situ tonnes and grade and allow for geological losses such as faults, dykes, potholes and IRUP.
Mineral Resources are estimated using a minimum true width of at least 90 cm and therefore may include some diluting material.

A Mineral Resource estimate of the Eastern Platinum No 1 tailings dam has been included in the Mineral Resources.
The remaining tailing dams will be considered as and when the appropriate assessments take place.
For economic studies and the determination of pay limits, consideration was made of both short and long-term revenue drivers.
The following long-term global assumptions were used: Precious Metals per Troy Ounce : Pt USD1,750, Pd USD870, Rh USD1,500, Ru USD205, Ir USD610, Au USD1,500.
Base Metals per metric tonne : Ni USD19,000, Cu USD6,500.
Average exchange rate of USD1 to ZAR8.5.
Dilutions are quoted as waste tonnes waste ore tonnes in percent.
Bumbo Mineral Resources are reported using a cut-off grade of 0.7% copper equivalent.
The copper equivalent formula for Bumbo was based upon commodity prices at the close of the market on 25th July 2011, namely: Copper: USD9,633 tonne $Cu Zinc: USD2,441 tonne $Zn Gold: USD1,614 ounce $Au Silver: USD40 ounce $Ag The copper equivalent CuEq is as follows: CuEq % Cu% Zn% $Zn 100 $Cu 100 Au g t $Au 31.1034768 $Cu 100 Ag g t $Ag 31.1034768 $Cu 100 Unless otherwise stated, the Lonmin Mineral Resources and Reserves estimates were prepared or supervised by various persons employed by Lonmin.
