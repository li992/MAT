Defined contribution pension costs totalled $10 million for the 12 months to 31 December 2012 nine months to 31 December 2011: $7 million.
The contributions are recognised as pension costs when they are due.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan creates a financial obligation to provide funding to the pension plan to provide a retired employee with pension benefits usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
The two defined benefit plans operated are the Man Group plc Pension Fund in the UK the UK plan and the Man Group Pension Plan in Switzerland the Swiss Plan.
At 31 December 2012, the UK plan comprised 86% 31 December 2011: 83% of the Groups total defined benefit pension obligations.
The UK plan was closed to new members in May 1999, and to future accrual in May 2011.
Employed members of the UK Plan retain enhanced benefits, including a link to salary, on their accrued benefits in the UK Plan.
Future benefits are provided via a defined contribution plan.
The Swiss plan remains open to new members.
It is a mandatory BVG basic pension scheme.
Such schemes aim to maintain the recipients accustomed standard of living.
The law requires minimum contributions to the employers pension scheme to be withheld from income, up to a specific ceiling.
The asset recognised in the Group balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the fair value of plan assets including the Reservoir Trust described below less the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date adjusted for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses by applying the corridor approach.

Pension benefits continued The latest funding valuation of the UK Plan was carried out by independent qualified actuaries as at 31 December 2011 and indicated a deficit of 45 million, after including 49 million of assets in the Reservoir Trust.
To remove the funding deficit, Man has agreed to make an annual cash payment of 11.8 million at 31 March 2013, 2014 and 2016 with a further lump sum to be contributed from the Reservoir Trust in March 2018 of up to 69.0 million to cover any remaining funding deficit.
This funding plan has been agreed by the directors and in principle by the Trustees.
Cash contributions of 7.3 million were made to the UK Plan in the year to 31 December 2012.
In order to maintain flexibility with regards to the funding of the UK Plan, Man also set up the Man Group Reservoir Trust the Reservoir Trust in 2010.
Man contributed $76 million 50 million of assets to the Reservoir Trust on 31 March 2010 and has committed to ensure the Reservoir Trust value remains at least 69 million from 1 April 2013 or at the level of the funding deficit in the UK Plan, if lower.
The Reservoir Trust gives the pension trustees comfort that Man can fund a deficit at 31 December 2017 and in the event that the UK Plan is fully funded, allows Man to recover the assets so that the UK Plan is not over funded.
