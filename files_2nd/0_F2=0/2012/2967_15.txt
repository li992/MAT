The Facility currently bears interest at LIBOR EURIBOR plus a margin of 65 basis points bps.
The margin varies based on changes to Carnival Corporations and Carnival plcs long-term senior unsecured credit ratings.
We are required to pay a commitment fee of 35% of the margin per annum on any undrawn portion.
If more than one-third or if more than two-thirds of the Facility is drawn, we will incur an additional 15 bps or 30 bps utilization fee, respectively, on the total amount outstanding.
