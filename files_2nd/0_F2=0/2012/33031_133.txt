The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair values of the TSR elements of the 2012 SVP grant, the 2012, 2011 and 2010 EDIP grants and the 2011 and 2010 CPP grants.
In accordance with the plans rules, the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against its principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historical dividends, share price volatilities and covariancesofBP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the intended value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
