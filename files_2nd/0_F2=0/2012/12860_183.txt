Post-retirement benefits The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees.
The defined benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes which are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
The defined contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
The Company closed the DC section from 31 March 2011 and replaced it with a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP, a new defined contribution scheme managed by Zurich.
All existing DC members have been automatically transferred to the GPP Plan.
The DC Section will be wound up by the Trustees in due course.
The expected employer cash contribution to the defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 March 2013 is 19.7m 2012: 83.2m.
There were no outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date March 2011: nil.
Triennial funding valuation The most recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the QinetiQ Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2011 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 74.7m.
On the basis of this full valuation, the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed the employer contribution rate of 12.7% from 30 June 2011, past service deficit recovery payments of 10.5m a year for a six-year period from 1 April 2012 and an immediate one-off contribution of 40m into the scheme.
As part of a package of measures to provide stability to the scheme, the Company has also contributed an asset in the form of an interest through a Scottish limited partnership see below in a future income stream of approximately 2.5m per annum, increasing in line with the Consumer Price Index, for 20 years secured on certain properties owned by the Group.
Finally, subsequent to ratification by a court ruling, the Company and Trustees also agreed the key provision that the Trustees will select the Consumer Price Index rather than the Retail Price Index as the relevant index for the increase of pensions in payment in respect of service before 1 June 2008 and for the revaluation of preserved benefits.
Prior to the court ruling the Retail Price Index had always been used as the relevant index.
This change results in a one-off past service credit of 141.4m.
The next scheduled triennial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2014.
QinetiQs Pension Funding Partnership Structure Following the 30 June 2011 valuation, a package of pension changes has been agreed with the Trustees to provide stability to the scheme.
As part of the package of proposals, on 26 March 2012 QinetiQ established the QinetiQ PFP Limited Partnership the Partnership with the scheme.
Under this arrangement, properties to the capitalised value of 32.3m were transferred to the Partnership.
The transfers were effected through a 20-year sale and leaseback agreement.
The schemes interest in the Partnership entitles it to an annual distribution of approximately 2.5m for 20 years: indexed with reference to CPI.
These contributions will replace part of the regular contributions made under the past deficit recovery payments plan.
The schemes interest in the Partnership will revert back to QinetiQ Limited in 2032.
The Partnership is controlled by QinetiQ and its results are consolidated by the Group.
Under IAS 19, the interest held by the scheme in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Groups consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.
As a result, the Groups consolidated financial statements are unchanged by the Partnership.
In addition, the value of the property transferred to the Partnership and leased back to QinetiQ remains on the balance sheet.
QinetiQ retains the operational flexibility to substitute properties of equivalent value within the Partnership and has the option to settle outstanding amounts due under the interest before 2032 if it so chooses.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group has a small number of employees for whom benefits are secured through the Prudential Platinum Scheme.
The net pension deficits of this scheme at 31 March 2012 amounted to nil 31 March 2011: nil.
QinetiQ also offers employees access to a Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan, but no Company contributions are paid to this arrangement.

Post-retirement benefits continued Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2012 2011 Rate of increase in salaries 3.6% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.6% 3.6% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 4.8% 5.6% RPI inflation assumption 3.4% 3.6% CPI inflation assumption 2.6% 2.7% Assumed life expectancies in years: Future male pensioners currently aged 60 88 88 Future female pensioners currently aged 60 90 90 Future male pensioners currently aged 40 90 90 Future female pensioners currently aged 40 92 91 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, because of the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term and, in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate, are measured by external market indicators.
The mortality assumptions as at 31 March 2012 were 90% of S1PMA for males and 100% of S1PFA for females, based on year of birth making allowance for improvements in mortality in line with CMI 2011 Core Projections and a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The comparative period used mortality rates reflecting the tables as published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and previously adopted as standard by the actuarial profession.
These were tables PNMA00MC for males and PNFA00MC for females for members year of birth.
The balance sheet net pension liability is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit depends, therefore, on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries and investment advisors.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 21.1m Rate of inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 22.2m Salary increase Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 3.5m Rate of mortality Increase by one year Increase by 19.3m Scheme assets The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the expected return rates for each asset class.
Equity return rates are the long-term expected return rates based on the market rates of return for risk-free investments, typically government bonds, together with the historical level of risk premium associated with equities: with the resulting rate then being reviewed and benchmarked against a peer group of listed companies.
Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets weighted to reflect the individual scheme actual asset allocations were: 2012 2011 Equities 7.3% 8.0% Corporate bonds 4.3% 5.5% Government bonds 3.2% 4.3% Property 6.8% 8.0% Cash 3.2% 4.3% Weighted average 5.8% 6.9% Return on scheme assets all figures in million 2012 2011 Actual return on plan assets: Expected return on scheme assets 67.6 68.6 Actuarial gain loss on scheme assets 2.9 14.0 Actual gain on scheme assets 70.5 54.6 Defined contribution schemes Payments to the defined contribution schemes totalled 20.3m March 2011: 24.1m.
