Notes to the Accounts Continued 7 Taxation continued The tax on the Groups profit before tax differs from the amount that would arise using the tax rate applicable to the profits of the consolidated Group as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Profit before tax 35,417 30,436 Tax at 26.31% 2011: 28% 9,318 8,522 Tax effects of: Items that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 316 239 Current tax adjustment in respect of prior years 205 66 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of prior years 172 306 Deferred tax adjustment in respect of change in deferred tax rate 1,466 705 Allowable loss on disposal of properties 1,181 Current year impact of change in deferred tax rate 51 40 Share options permanent difference 1 614 Permanent difference on impairment of intangible assets 89 Other differences 41 120 Total tax expense 7,271 7,851 The weighted average tax rate was 20.5% 2011: 25.8%.
The main rate of U. K. Corporation tax was reduced from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011.
The Finance Act 2011 further reduced the main rate of U. K. Corporation tax to 25% from 1 April 2012.
The reduction to 26% was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011, effective from 1 April 2011.
A reduction to 25% was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011 and was to be effective from 1 April 2012.
The effect of these rate changes will be to reduce the Groups future current tax charge.
As this rate change to 25% has been substantively enacted it has the effect of reducing the Groups net deferred tax liabilities recognised at 28 January 2012 by 1.2 million.
The Budget on 21 March 2012 proposed further changes to the main rate of U. K. Corporation Tax, with the main rate of U. K. Corporation tax reducing to 24% from 1 April 2012 and a further two percent reduction to 22% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these financial statements.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction due to legislation not being enacted, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax liabilities accordingly.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the parent by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding shares held by the employee share scheme trusts.
2012 2011 Profit attributable to equity holders of the Company 000 28,146 22,585 Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 38,328,493 38,385,598 Basic earnings per share pence 73.43 58.84 For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
