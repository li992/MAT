S. Sofra in Turkey from our former joint venture partner.
Under International Financial Reporting Standard 3 Business combinations revised 2008 IFRS 3 2008, the interest previously held by the Group was remeasured to its fair value at the acquisition date.
This resulted in a gain of 16 million arising on the revaluation of our existing interest which was recorded on a separate line in the income statement.
IFRS 3 2008 requires that the interest should be treated on the same basis as would be required if the acquirer had disposed directly of the previously held interest and then reacquired it at fair value.
Prior to the acquisition, the interest in Sofra was proportionally consolidated as explained in section D of the Groups accounting policies.

Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of the changes in statutory rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 and 23% from 1 April 2013.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
