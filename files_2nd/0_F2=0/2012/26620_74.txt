Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
The consideration transferred is the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
From a capital management perspective all goodwill and acquired intangibles, net of deferred taxes, are supported with shareholders equity.
This approach is consistent with our regulatory capital treatment.
The acquisition of GLG was supported with existing excess shareholders capital and the issuance of new Man shares to the principals and key employees.
Investment management contracts IMCs IMCs are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows of the contracts and distribution channels acquired and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives which are between 9 to 12 years, and 10 years for the GLG and FRM brand names.
Allocation of goodwill to cash generating units The Group has three identified cash-generating units for impairment review purposes: GLG, FRM, and AHL.
The goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of FRM has been allocated to the FRM cash generating unit as the acquired FRM business has been fully integrated with the previous Man Multi-Manager business, which will benefit from all of the synergies from the acquisition.
In the prior period, the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired on the acquisition of GLG was allocated to the cash generating units CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination.
As at the date of acquisition, 77% of the acquired goodwill and all other intangible assets was allocated to the GLG CGU goodwill: $1,077 million: other intangibles $672 million with the remaining 23% of the goodwill allocated to the AHL CGU goodwill: $326 million.
