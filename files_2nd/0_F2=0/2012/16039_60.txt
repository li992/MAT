Adjusted interest cover is calculated by dividing, adjusted operating profit of 326.6m 2011: 313.2m less 1.5m 2011: 1.5m of specifically excluded IFRS adjustments, by the combined value of interest on bank loans and overdrafts excluding amortised bank finance charges, other interest payable and interest receivable, which total 24.8m 2011: 20.3m.
The pre exceptional unwinding of the discounts charge arises principally from the property provisions created in 2008 and the liability to the pension scheme associated with the SPV.
During 2011 the Group repaid $125m of the BSS unsecured senior notes and terminated the associated derivatives.
This resulted in a net loss of 4.4m, which was shown as exceptional.
