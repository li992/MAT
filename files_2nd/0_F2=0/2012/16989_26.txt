Financial Statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account except when hedge accounting is applied.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for ofce equipment and 25% for computer equipment.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is amortised over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at the rate of 25% for purchased software.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benets The Company and other UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer dened benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts.
These plans are operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are dened contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises.
Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
Pension plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Companys unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged against operating profit.
The increase in the period in the present value of the plans liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to dened contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
140 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012 I II Share-based payments III Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Executive Bonus Scheme EBS and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The fair value of the LTIP at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on IV a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions.
The EBS is determined as a percentage of the annual bonus.
This percentage is matched by the Company with a share award that will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date provided the individual continues to hold the original bonus shares awarded and continues to be employed by the company at the date of vesting.
The EBS includes a strategic bonus shares element for a limited number of senior employees.
The fair value of the matching and strategic elements of the EBS is determined at the date of grant of the bonus and the cost is recognised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 and were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
Financial assets & liabilities The Companys principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and xed rate notes, cash and short-term deposits.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by FRS26 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under FRS26 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classied as a cash ow hedge or fair value hedge.
To the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the profit and loss account.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the profit and loss account or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS29 and has not disclosed information required by that standard in relation to derivative financial instruments as the Groups consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for the Group under IFRS7.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.

These dened benets plans are funded multi-employer plans which are operated by The Weir Group PLC and which are run on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities.
In accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to these plans as if they were dened contribution plans.
While assets and liabilities in respect of these plans are not reected on the Companys balance sheet, details of these are set out below.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualied actuaries on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method.
The Company made special contributions of 7.5m in 2012 2011: 6.6m in addition to the employers regular contributions.
The special contributions for 2013 are expected to be 12.1m, reducing to 9.6m in 2014.
The total contributions to the dened benefit plans in 2013 are expected to be 14.4m 2012: 9.6m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.
The actual return on plan assets in the period was a gain of 63.6m 2011: 31.7m.

This decision was announced to the members of the scheme in July 2011.
The past service gain was recognised last year as an exceptional item in the Consolidated Income Statement.
