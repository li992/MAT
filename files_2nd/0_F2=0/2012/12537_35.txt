120 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2012 25.
Acquisition of subsidiaries In January 2012, the company completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore Oil plc EnCore.
EnCore was an AIM listed oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the offshore UK Continental Shelf where its portfolio of assets included interests in the Catcher and Cladhan discoveries, exploration acreage and a 29.65 per cent holding in Egdon Resources plc, an AIM listed exploration and production company focused on onshore assets with interests in the UK and Europe.
Under the terms of the agreement announced on 5 October 2011, shareholders in EnCore were offered a consideration of 70 pence in cash for each EnCore share held.
Alternatively, EnCore shareholders could elect to receive 0.2067 new shares in the company for each EnCore share held instead of part or all of the cash consideration.
On completion, shareholders representing 93.5 per cent of EnCores shares elected to take new Premier shares, resulting in the company paying a total of 14.1 million US$21.6 million in cash to EnCore shareholders and issuing 60,931,514 new Ordinary Shares to those who chose the share alternative.
The new shares began trading on 17 January 2012.
As a result of the acquisition, the group increased its stake in the Catcher project from 35 to 50 per cent and became operator of the development.
Prior to completion of the EnCore transaction, the company reached an agreement to on-sell the 16.6 per cent interest in the Cladhan area which it indirectly acquired from the EnCore acquisition for an adjusted consideration of US$52.4 million.
The buyer also agreed to farm-in to a 50 per cent interest in EnCores wholly-owned Block 28 10a on a promoted basis whereby it paid 80 per cent of certain well costs and 50 per cent of back costs on the Coaster prospect, which was drilled as part of the companys 2012 drilling programme.
The on-sale of these assets was completed in March 2012.
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 16 January 2012, being the date on which the group gained control of EnCore.
Information in respect of assets acquired and the fair value allocation to the EnCore assets in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 - Business Combinations is as follows: Fair values $ million Net assets acquired: Intangible exploration and evaluation assets 74.6 Property, plant and equipment 138.8 Investment in associate 7.5 Trade and other receivables 3.4 Restricted cash 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents 19.0 Assets held for sale 52.4 Trade and other payables 30.1 Deferred tax liabilities 103.8 Long-term provisions 2.2 Total identifiable assets 166.8 Goodwill 240.8 Total consideration 407.6 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 121 25.
Acquisition of subsidiaries continued $ million Satisfied by: Cash 21.6 Equity instruments 60,931,514 Ordinary Shares 386.0 Total consideration transferred 407.6 $ million Net cash inflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 21.6 Less: cash and restricted cash balances acquired 26.2 Net cash inflow 4.6 These fair values have been finalised based on a detailed review of the exploration portfolio and a reassessment of the Catcher area discoveries in December 2012.
Goodwill arises due to the difference between the fair value of the assets and the consideration transferred and also due to the requirement to recognise deferred UK corporation tax liabilities in respect of for the difference between the assigned fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition-related expenses of US$6.9 million had been incurred by the group in 2011 and 2012 and were included within general and administration costs.
Premier acquired exploration interests as part of the acquisition and fair valued these assets within the EnCore portfolio.
During 2012 three exploration prospects were drilled, two of which were unsuccessful.
The unsuccessful drilling resulted in an exploration write-off of US$49.0 million income statement, being the only significant impact on the groups 2012 profit arising from the acquisition.
Events after the balance sheet date Letter of Credit Facilities In March 2013, the company negotiated an additional 100 million US$163.0 million letter of credit facility, increasing them to 316.0 million US$515.1 million.
This facility will expire in 2015.
Dividends On the 19 March 2013 the Board proposed a final dividend of 5 pence per share 2011: nil.
This dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held in London on 7 June 2013.
If approved, the dividend will be paid on 14 June 2013 to shareholders on the register as of 17 May 2013.

Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The results relate entirely to continuing operations.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Further information relating to the going concern assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension costs The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997.
The company accounts for pension costs in line with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 - Retirement Benefits.
The amounts charged to operating profit regarding the defined benefit scheme are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits do not vest immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest costs and the expected return on the assets are shown as a net amount of other financial costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method, and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange The local currency of the company is US dollars.
All transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the local currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year-end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year-end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
Cash flow statement No cash flow statement is prepared for the company under FRS 1 - Cash Flow Statements as the cash flows of the company have been included in the group cash flow statement of Premier Oil plc.
Related party transactions The company has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 8 - Related Party Disclosures with regard to the non-disclosure of transactions between group companies.
Share-based payments The company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The main assumptions are provided in note 8.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more tax.
The exception to this is that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The disclosures set out below are based on calculations carried out as at 31 December 2012 by a qualified independent actuary.
The figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits incorporating the amendment announced in December 2006.
The Schemes assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The Trustee of the Scheme is required to act in the best interest of the Schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of members of the Trustee Board is determined by the trust documentation.
The liabilities of the defined benefit Scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out of the Scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This amount is reflected in the surplus or the deficit in the balance sheet.
The projected unit credit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the Scheme liabilities make allowance for the projected earnings.
The liabilities set out in this note have been calculated using membership data current as at 31 December 2012.
The results of the calculations and the assumptions adopted are shown below.
As at 31 December 2012, contributions are payable to the Scheme by the company at the rates set out in the schedule of contributions dated 27 July 2012.
Under this schedule, the company contributes on a monthly basis at the rate of 30 per cent of the aggregate of the members pensionable salaries.

The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2012 is 4.4 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2013 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.

Pension schemes continued Sensitivity and risk The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with a significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the FRS 17 balance sheet position to small changes in some of the assumptions.
Where one assumption has been changed all the other assumptions are kept the same as disclosed.
Change from Revised disclosed Surplus Surplus Deficit Deficit $ million $ million Discount rate less 0.1% pa 3.5 0.7 RPI inflation and linked assumptions plus 0.1% pa 3.5 0.7 Members living one year longer than expected 3.5 0.9 The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows: a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: an increase in price inflation and or salary inflation: and improving life expectancy lower mortality rates resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2012 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2011: US$0.9 million.
Commitments and guarantees At the year-end date the company, together with certain subsidiary undertakings, had jointly guaranteed the groups borrowing facilities which consist of a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$695.0 million revolving credit facility and a 216.0 million US$351.1 million letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015, a US$350.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in 2017, and private placements of senior notes of US$244.0 million and 75.0 million, and US$202.0 million and 25.0 million with various maturities starting from 2018 to 2024.

Winding up or reduction of capital: on a return of capital on a winding up or otherwise other than on conversion, redemption or purchase of shares the rights of the holders of Ordinary Shares to participate in the distribution of the assets of the company available for distribution shall rank pari passu in all respects with each other.
Voting rights: the holders of Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to receive notice of, attend, vote and speak at any General Meeting of the company.
Share-based payments and share incentive plans The group currently operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for all employees and a Share Incentive Plan and a Save As You Earn Scheme for UK-based and expatriate employees only.
For the year ended 31 December 2012, the total cost recognised by the company for equity-settled share-based payment transactions is US$30.5 million.
A credit of US$30.5 million has been recorded in retained earnings 2011: US$34.6 million for all equity-settled payments of the group.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil plc group.
Part of this cost is therefore recharged to the relevant subsidiary undertaking where it is capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the income statement as operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
Details of the different share incentive plans currently in operation are set out below: i Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 2009 to provide a long-term all employee scheme which motivates all employees and provides a longer-term perspective to the total remuneration package.
Awards under the LTIP comprise three elements: Equity Pool Awards and Performance Share Awards that vest after the expiry of a three-year performance period, and a potential Matching Award that vests at the expiry of a further three-year performance period, commencing at the end of the three-year performance period for Equity Pool and Performance Share Awards.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the Equity bonus pool of the plan and of the Performance Share Awards.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 41.0% to 42.0% Risk free rate of interest: 1.1% to 3.7% Correlation factor with comparator group: 0.30 to 0.35 ii Share Incentive Plan Under the share incentive plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy partnership shares.
If an employee agrees to buy partnership shares the company currently matches the number of partnership shares bought with an award of shares matching shares, on a one-for-one basis.
