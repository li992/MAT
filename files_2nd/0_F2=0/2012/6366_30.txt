The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.
Where derivatives do qualify for hedge accounting, the treatment of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged as described below: Fair value hedge The change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the related portion of the hedged item is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Cash ow hedge The change in the fair value of the portion of the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in equity and subsequently recycled to the profit and loss account when the hedged cash ow impacts the profit and loss account.
The ineffective portion of the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currencies The financial statements of the company are presented in sterling, its functional currency.
Transactions in currencies other than sterling are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.

The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company together with G4S International Finance plc therefore hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to uctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Cross currency swaps with a nominal value of 134m were arranged to hedge the foreign currency risk on US$265m of the second US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008, effectively xing the sterling value on this portion of debt at an exchange rate of 1.9750.
Assuming a 1% appreciation of sterling against the US dollar, the fair value net gain on the cross currency swaps which hedge part of the currency loan notes would be expected to fall by 2m.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at oating rates as described in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements exposes the group to cash ow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to x the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum of five years.
At 31 December 2012 the nominal value of such contracts was nil in respect of US dollar 2011: 71m and 73m in respect of euro 2011: 121m, their weighted average interest rate was nil% US dollar 2011: 4.8% and 3.2% euro 2011: 3.6 %, and their weighted average period to maturity was one year and two months.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash ow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The quantity of interest rate swaps outstanding in the company is expected to continue to decline as Treasury activity isincreasingly conducted by G4S International Finance plc.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a xed rate market, with investors looking for a xed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of the first issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of oating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of xed rate debt arranged xed to oating swaps effectively converting the xed coupon on the Private Placement to a oating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement xed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The interest on the US Private Placement notes issued in July 2008 and on the GBP Public Bond issued in May 2009 was kept at xed rate.
The core company borrowings are held in US dollar, euro and sterling.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is largely shielded by xed rate loans and interest rate swaps which x a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
A 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies with the 31 December 2012 debt position constant throughout 2013, would lead to an expectation of an additional interest charge of 3m in the 2013 financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the uctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash solutions businesses.
The company acts as a market intermediary, arranging commodity swaps and commodity options with its relationship banks with back to back deals on identical terms with its subsidiaries to x synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
Counterparty credit risk The companys strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
The total mark to market value outstanding with each counterparty is closely monitored against policy limits assigned to each counterparty.
Forshort-term transactions under one year, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agencies.
For long-term transactions, at inception of the transaction, the financial counterparty must have aminimum rating of BBB Baa1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the companys relationship banks, all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2012 the largest two counterparty exposures relating to treasury transactions were 38m and 30m and both were held with institutions with long-term Standard & Poors credit ratings of Aand A respectively.
These exposures represent 37% 2011: 38% and 29% 2011: 27% of the carrying values ofderivative financial instruments, with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
Both of these banks had significant loan commitments outstanding to G4S plc at 31 December 2012.
The company participates in the groups multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly-owned subsidiary of an Aa3 rated bank.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
