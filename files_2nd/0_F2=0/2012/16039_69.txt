The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 59 days 2011: 55 days.
The allowance for doubtful debts is estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
The business has provided fully for all receivables outstanding for more than 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables not receivable for up to 90 days are specifically provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at between 2% to 4% above the clearing bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors unprovided against with a carrying amount of 57.4m 2011: 65.9m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable and therefore there is no allowance for doubtful debts.
Except for some instances of personal guarantees the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
