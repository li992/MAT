The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The value-in-use calculations are based on cash ows over five years grown at 2% in perpetuity.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and compound annual cash ow growth rate for the five-year business plan.
Management estimates discount rates using W CC rates that reect the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks A specic to the CGUs.
The discount rates used varied between 10.1% and 18.8% based on the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The compound annual cash ow growth rates range from 1% growth to 37% growth.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
ilst there is some uncertainty regarding the short-term impact of the political events in MENA, the G oup does not consider that the likelihood Wh r of impairment losses in the long-term has increased.
