As at 31 March 2012 this asset related solely to losses in subsidiary companies.
It is considered too uncertain that the Group will generate profits in these companies that the losses would be available to offset against and, on this basis, the deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has not been recognised.
74 TR Property Investment Trust THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 8 Taxation continued Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
In respect of properties held in subsidiaries, provision for capital gains tax has been made for revaluation surpluses not sheltered by brought forward capital losses or non-trade debits.
In March 2012 as part of the 2012 Budget, the UK Government announced its intention to legislate to reduce the rate of Corporation Tax to 24% with effect from April 2012, which was subsequently enacted under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
The effect of this reduction is reflected in the unrecognised tax assets disclosed in this note.
