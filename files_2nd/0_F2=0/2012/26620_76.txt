81 Man Group plc Annual Report 2012 12.
Goodwill and acquired intangibles continued Under IFRS 3 Business combinations, Man is required to calculate the fair value of acquired assets.
Provisional values for the acquired business, atthe date of acquisition, are set out in the table below: Fair value Provisional $m Provisional Book value adjustments value Cash and cash equivalents 106 106 Fee and other receivables 45 6 39 Investments in fund products 3 3 Leasehold improvements and equipment 1 1 Intangible assets 32 32 Trade and other payables 36 3 39 Deferred tax arising on other intangible assets 6 6 Net assets acquired 119 17 136 Goodwill on acquisition 16 Net assets acquired including goodwill 152 Purchase consideration: Cash consideration 66 Contingent cash consideration 86 Total consideration 152 The fair value adjustments relate primarily to the recognition of intangible assets comprising acquired investment management contracts IMCs andthe FRM brand, which were valued at $31 million and $1 million respectively.
These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows generated from the assets and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected life of 10 years.
Deferred tax has been provided on the value of the intangible assets $6 million and this is a non-cash item as the liability arises due to the tax non-deductibility of the amortisation of IMCs.
Goodwill primarily represents the cost synergies to be generated from acquiring and integrating the FRM business with the legacy Man Multi Manager business.
Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Acquisition costs of $12 million, primarily relating to redundancy costs, legal fees and advisor fees, have been expensed and do not form part of goodwill Note 2.
The contingent cash consideration of $86 million is calculated as the present value of expected earn out payments and dividends on the perpetual preference shares issued to SMTB.
The contingent consideration is deemed to be a financial liability measured initially at fair value and subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.
In addition to the assets and liabilities in the above table, an indemnification asset and corresponding liability, in relation to employee loans, arose on acquisition, which have subsequently been fully settled.
The post tax result for the period since the acquisition date for the legacy FRM business alone amounted to a $4 million profit, excluding pre-tax items inrelation to the post-acquisition amortisation of purchased intangibles $1 million and acquisition costs $12 million, partially offset by excluding the fairvalue gain of $6 million on the contingent consideration.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the post tax profit forFRM would have been $7 million, excluding amortisation of purchased intangibles $3 million and a charge of $33 million for acquisition and restructuring costs relating to the pre and post-acquisition period, partially offset by excluding a fair value gain of $3 million on contingent consideration.
This result does not include any benefit from cost synergies.
Revenue for the period since the acquisition date for the legacy FRM business amounted to$36 million, and if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue would have been $80 million.
