In addition for 2012, operating profi t excludes the gain arising on the acquisition of REALIC and the dilution of the Groups holding in PPM South Africa.
The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profi t attributable to shareholders.
The Company believes that operating profi t, as adjusted for these items, better refl ects underlying performance.
Profi t before tax and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
ii The value of future profi ts or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered insurance businesses are included in the profi ts for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profi ts from the management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected margin for the year arising from the management of the assets of the covered business as defi ned in note 1 a by the Groups asset management businesses.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered insurance business.
Group operating profi t accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profi t in respect of management of the covered business assets.
iii During 2011, the Group altered its infl ation measure basis for future statutory increases to pension payments for certain tranches of its UK defi ned benefi t pension schemes.
This refl ected the UK Governments decision to replace the basis of indexation from RPI with CPI.
This resulted in a credit to operating profi t for 2011 on an IFRS basis of 42 million and an additional 3 million recognised on the EEV basis.
iv Restructuring costs comprise the charge of 19 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 3 million recognised on the EEV basis for the shareholders share of restructuring costs incurred by the PAC with-profi ts fund.
Solvency II implementation costs comprise the charge of 48 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 2 million recognised on the EEV basis.
v The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported average exchange rates for the year.

For IFRS reporting purposes, the Group has adopted updated US GAAP requirements for deferred acquisition costs as an improvement to its accounting policy under IFRS 4 for those operations of the Group which measure insurance assets and liabilities substantially by reference to US GAAP principles.
Accordingly, the IFRS elements and additional EEV basis shareholders interest for the comparative results for 2011 have been adjusted from those previously published for the retrospective application of the change as if the new accounting policy had always applied.
This has resulted in a reallocation of 553 million for 2011 from IFRS basis shareholders reserves to shareholders accrued interest in the long-term business, with no overall eff ect on the EEV basis results.
The supplementary information on pages 326 to 362 was approved by the Board of directors on 12 March 2013 and signed on its behalf.
