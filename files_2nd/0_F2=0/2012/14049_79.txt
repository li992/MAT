Deferred tax Deferred income taxes are calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method, using local substantively enacted tax rates.
The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2012 2011 m m At 1 January asset 5.9 23.5 Income statement charge note 12 12.6 1.6 Acquisitions disposals 6.5 10.8 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income note 12 25.4 26.5 Exchange differences 0.3 At 31 December asset 12.2 5.9 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year was as follows: Temporary Share-based differences payment and Retirement Derivative Other on assets employee benefit financial temporary intangibles benets schemes instruments differences Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2012 25.6 23.8 18.5 9.1 17.1 5.9 Credited charged to income statement 3.9 4.6 0.7 11.2 12.6 Acquisitions disposals 4.0 0.1 2.0 0.4 6.5 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 2.5 18.4 4.5 25.4 Exchange differences 2.3 0.2 0.1 2.0 At 31 December 2012 23.4 21.4 2.9 13.6 3.5 12.2 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the previous year was as follows: Temporary Share-based differences payment and Retirement Derivative Other on assets employee benefit financial temporary intangibles benets schemes instruments differences Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2011 17.3 27.1 13.5 0.3 0.1 23.5 Credited charged to income statement 6.8 2.2 0.7 6.9 1.6 Acquisitions disposals 16.7 1.4 26.1 10.8 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 2.6 32.7 8.8 26.5 Exchange differences 1.6 0.1 2.0 0.3 At 31 December 2011 25.6 23.8 18.5 9.1 17.1 5.9 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same scal authority.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2012 2011 m m Deferred tax liabilities 31.1 22.3 Deferred tax assets 43.3 28.2 12.2 5.9 At the balance sheet date, the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 16.5m 2011: 10.2m which principally relate to unused tax losses of 48.4m 2011: 34.9m.
Losses of 11.8m 2011: 4.5m expire within five years, losses of 24.4m 2011: 17.2m expire within six to ten years and losses of 12.2m 2011: 13.2m may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was nil 2011: 0.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
