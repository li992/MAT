The cost of internal labour capitalised is not material for separate disclosure.
The goodwill acquired balance relates to the Groups acquisition of kiddicare.
com Limited Kiddicare 24m and Flower World Limited 3m and has been allocated to the respective cash-generating units CGUs.
The value of goodwill has been tested for impairment during the current financial year by comparing the recoverable amount on a value in use basis of each CGU to the carrying value of goodwill.
The key assumptions for the Kiddicare value in use calculations are based on the latest Board approved cash flow projections for the next five years and for subsequent years: a long term growth assumption of 2% has been applied.
These cash flows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 8%.
Changes in income and expenditure are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
No impairment arose during the year as a result of this test.
The remaining goodwill of 10m 2011: 7m is allocated across the respective CGUs.
Impairment tests have been performed on the remaining goodwill based on value in use and similar assumptions to those above or on a net asset basis where appropriate.
No impairment loss was identified in the current financial year 2011: nil.
The valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
