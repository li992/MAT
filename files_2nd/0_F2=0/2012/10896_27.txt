Cash flows are expected to be incurred between 2012 and 2060.
A number of uncertainties affect the calculation of the provision including the impact of regulation, the accuracy of the site surveys, unexpected contaminants, transportation costs, the impact of alternative technologies and changes in the discount rate.
The provision incorporates our best estimate of the financial effect of these uncertainties, but future material changes in any of the assumptions could materially impact on the calculation of the provision and hence the income statement.
The undiscounted amount of the provision at 31 March 2012 was 92m 2011: 112m, being the best undiscounted estimate of the liability having regard to these uncertainties.
Restructuring provision At 31 March 2012, 14m of the total restructuring provision 2011: 26m related to the restructuring of our LNG storage facilities, and 13m consisted of provisions for the disposal of surplus leasehold interests and rates payable on surplus properties 2011: 14m.
The expected payment dates for property restructuring costs remain uncertain.

Other provisions Other provisions at 31 March 2012 include 24m 2011: 22m in respect of employer liability claims.
In accordance with insurance industry practice, the estimates for employer liability claims are based on experience from previous years and, therefore, there is no identifiable payment date associated with these items.
