I Important Information for South African Shareholders: Holders of the Companys shares in South Africa should note that National Treasury introduced a new Dividends Tax with effect from 1 April 2012, at a rate of 15 per cent.
The final cash dividend received by a South African shareholder will constitute a foreign dividend and will therefore be subject to Dividends Tax.
Dividends Tax will be withheld from the amount of the final dividend at a rate of 15 per cent, unless a shareholder qualifies for an exemption or a reduced rate of Dividends Tax and the prescribed requirements for effecting the exemption or reduction, as set out in the Scrip Dividend Scheme booklet, are in place.
It is the Companys understanding that a receipt of shares pursuant to the scrip dividend alternative will not constitute a foreign dividend in terms of current legislation.
Under the current legislation, the scrip dividend will not be subject to Dividends Tax, nor income tax on receipt.
The new shares which are acquired under the scrip dividend alternative will be treated as having been acquired for nil consideration.
This information is included only as a general guide to taxation for Shareholders resident in South Africa based on Capcos understanding of the law and the practice currently in force.
Any Shareholder who is in any doubt as to their tax position should seek independent professional advice.
Further disclosures required in terms of the JSE Listings Requirements will be detailed in the finalisation announcement to be published on 10 May 2013.
