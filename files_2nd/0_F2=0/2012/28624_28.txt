Notes to the Company financial statements 37 Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The individual financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006 and have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the EU.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes that form a part of these approved financial statements.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures Intercompany balances and provisions The Group makes payments to new investment managers for the introduction of clients to the Companys operating subsidiaries.
The cost of these payments is recharged to the Companys subsidiaries and, historically, the related provisions were recognised in the accounts of the subsidiaries.
The underlying obligation to make these payments follows the employment contracts, which are with the Company.
Consequently, in these financial statements the presentation of provisions for earn-out payments has been amended to show the legal obligation and the related recoverable amounts from subsidiaries.
This has resulted in both an increase in the amounts owed by Group undertakings and an increase in provisions for liabilities and charges at 31 December 2011 of 6,478,000 2010: 3,305,000.
Developments in reporting standards and interpretations Developments in reporting standards and interpretations are set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are as set out below: Investments in subsidiaries and associates Investments in subsidiaries and associates are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provision for impairment.
Management charges Intra-Group management charges arise in relation to staff costs and other administrative expenses that are initially borne by the Company and then recharged to other Group companies, when incurred.
Accounting policies in relation to impairment, interest income, dividend income, operating leases, borrowings, foreign currency, retirement benefit obligations, taxation, cash and cash equivalents and share-based payments are set out in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
38 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty arise from the Companys defined benefit pension schemes and loan notes issued by former subsidiaries.
These are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

The Company categorises its financial risks into the following primary areas: i credit risk: ii liquidity risk: iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk : and iv pension risk.
The Companys exposures to pension risk are set out in note 48.
The sections below outline the Group risk appetite, as applicable to the Company, and explain how the Company defines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Companys financial risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the financial risks that the Company faces, to set appropriate risk tolerances, limits and controls and to monitor the financial risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The Company regularly reviews its financial risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business and the wider industry.
The Companys overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the Board of directors the Board.
The Board has embedded risk management within the business through the executive committee and senior management.
i Credit risk The Company takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its trading activities.
The principal sources of credit risk arise from depositing funds with banks and through providing long term and working capital financing for subsidiaries.
The Company also took on credit exposure through the provision of loans as part of the disposal of its subsidiaries in Jersey in 2008.
The Company places surplus funds with its banking subsidiary, which operates under the Groups credit risk management policies.
Group policy requires that funds are placed with a range of high-quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
For the purposes of financial reporting the Company categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd. Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
The Companys financial assets are categorised as follows: Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables relate to amounts placed with subsidiaries and loans provided to subsidiaries and former subsidiaries.
The collection and ageing of trade and other receivables are reviewed on a periodic basis by management.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
Trade and other receivables includes derivative financial instruments which relate to option contracts over shares in the Companys associates note 42.
These options expose the Company to credit risk from the potential for non-delivery by the associate companies founders, who are private individuals.
Cash and cash equivalents balances at banks The Company has exposure to financial institutions through its bank deposits reported within cash equivalents.

All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to loan notes, are set out in note 44.
No other impairment losses arose during the year 2011: none.

138 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 50 Financial instruments continued iii Market risk continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The Company is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 43.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 4,198,000 2011: 2,953,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 420,000 2011: 295,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the Companys financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of equity investments in subsidiaries which are carried at historical cost note 41.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2012 000 000 000 000 Available for sale equity securities 3,584 614 4,198 Derivative financial instruments 784 784 Total financial assets 3,584 1,398 4,982 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2011 000 000 000 000 Available for sale equity securities 2,384 569 2,953 Total financial assets 2,384 569 2,953 There have been no transfers between levels during the year 2011: none.
Details of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values of the financial assets in the above table, along with how reasonably possible changes to the assumptions affect these fair values, are provided in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements.
Level 3 financial instruments Changes in the fair values of financial instruments categorised as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy were as follows: 2012 2012 2011 2011 Available for Derivative Available for Derivative sale equity financial 2012 sale equity financial 2011 securities instruments Total securities instruments Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 569 569 574 574 Total gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income 45 45 5 5 Acquired during the year note 42 784 784 At 31 December 614 784 1,398 569 569 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2012 139 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 51 Capital management The Companys objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
For monitoring purposes, the Company defines capital as equity shareholders funds.
The Company monitors the level of distributable reserves on a monthly basis and compares this to forecast dividends.
Capital is distributed to the Company from operating subsidiaries on a timely basis to ensure sufficient capital is maintained.
The Board of directors considers the level of capital held in relation to forecast performance, dividend payments and wider plans for the business, although formal quantitative targets are not set.
The Companys total capital at 31 December 2012, together with movements during the year then ended, is set out in the Company statement of changes in equity.
On 6 November 2012, the Company issued two million ordinary shares by way of a placing for cash consideration which raised 23,956,000, net of 744,000 transaction costs note 27.
There were no changes in the Companys approach to capital management during the year.
52 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided in the normal course of business to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as trustees directors of client companies and providing other services.
A claim relating to the management of a Jersey trust has been filed against a former employee and director of Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited.
Rathbone Trust Company Jersey Limited was a subsidiary of the Company from March 2000 until October 2008.
Although the Board believe this claim will be unsuccessful, a possible obligation may exist which is contingent on whether the claim or any parts of it is upheld.
The Group has sought to confirm the position of the Companys civil liability professional indemnity insurers in relation to the claim.
Based on information currently available, the Companys primary layer insurer has confirmed cover including its share of the excess layer subject to policy terms and conditions and unless the proceedings referred to below rule there is no liability.
The remaining excess insurers have to date refused to confirm cover.
On 25 July 2012, the Company issued proceedings to confirm insurance cover against the excess insurers.
Due to the complexity of the claim, the number of parties involved and the impact of insurance cover available to the trustees, it is not practicable to estimate reliably the value of any possible obligation for the Company.
The Board considers that it is unlikely that a material liability to Rathbones will arise from this claim, and accordingly no provision has been made.
b The Company leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
