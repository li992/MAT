The Groups financial statements also comply with IFRS and interpretations by the IFRS Interpretations Committee as issued by the IASB.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings, available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss.
The Group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.
The Group presents its balance sheet in order of liquidity.
This is considered to be more relevant than a before and after 12 months presentation, given the long term nature of the Groups core business.
However, for each asset and liability line item which combines amounts expected to be recovered or settled before and after 12 months from the balance sheet date, disclosure of the split is made by way of a note.
The presentation of the order of the notes to the financial statements has been amended to enable greater understanding of the Groups financial position and performance, details of which are outlined in the contents page to this report.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the balance sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis.
Income and expenses are not offset in the income statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or IFRIC interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the Group.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions.
The functional currency of the Groups foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in whichthe entity operates.
The assets and liabilities of all of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Groups presentational currency, at the closing rate at the date of the balance sheet.
The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that are not yet effective Certain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 or later periods but which the Group has not adopted early.
Details of these are contained within Note 10 Financial investments, Note 52 Subsidiaries and Note 23 Provisions.
Use of estimates The preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates, possibly significantly.
This is particularly relevant for the determination of fair values of investment property Note 9 and unquoted and illiquid financial investments Note 10 : the estimation of deferred acquisition costs Note 40 : tax balances Notes 35, 41 and 42 : and the estimation of insurance and investment contract liabilities Notes 18 and 19.
The basis of accounting for these areas, and the significant judgements used in determining them, are outlined in the respective notes to the financial statements.
Reportable segments During the year, the Group has changed the management lines of the international subsidiaries to reflect the development of our international strategy.
This has had the consequence of changing the reportable segments of the Group.
Details of the Groups reportable segments are included in Note 27.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8, Operating segments, the prior period segmental information has been restated to reflect these changes.

All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are those entities including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts over which the Group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits Note 52.
Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the period are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control.
The interests of parties, other than the Group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as Net asset value attributable to unit holders Note 48 in the consolidated balance sheet.
The assets and liabilities of all of the Groups foreign operations are translated into sterling, the Groups presentational currency, at the closing exchange rate at the date of the balance sheet.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and the borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders equity.
Associates and joint ventures The Group has interests in associates and joint ventures Note 53 which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity partnerships, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities.
In accordance with the choices permitted by IAS 28, Investments in associates, and IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Associates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost.
The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the Groups share of the profit or loss after the date of the acquisition.
Product classification The Groups products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance contracts participating and non-participating or investment contracts participating and non-participating.
The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 18 and 19 respectively.
Fiduciary activities Assets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements.
Where the Group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.
change to accounting policy Us deferred acquisition costs During 2012, the Group has changed its accounting policy for deferred acquisition costs in the US.
This follows the FASBs pronouncement on deferral methodology, applying to reporting periods starting after 15 December 2011.
This has been applied toIFRS as an improvement in accounting policy, as allowed under IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
In October 2010, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Update 2010-26 on Accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts.
Under US GAAP, costs that can be deferred and amortised are those that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts.
The Update requires insurers tocapitalise only those incremental costs directly related to acquiring a contract, charging all other indirect acquisition expenses to the income statement as incurred.
The main impact of the update is therefore to disallow insurers from deferring indirect acquisition costs and those costs relating to unsuccessful sales.
We currently apply US GAAP to value the insurance assets and liabilities of our US operations, as allowed under IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
As a result of the FASBs pronouncement we are applying the change in deferral methodology for our US business for deferred acquisition costs retrospectively, restating the comparatives as required under IAS 8, Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
The impact of the restatement on 2012 was to reduce operating profit and profit before tax by 8m and profit after tax by 5m.

Supplementary operating profit has been adjusted to reflect the retrospective adoption of ASU 2010-26, issued by the FASB, which specifies the accounting for deferred acquisition costs under US GAAP.
The impact is to reduce US Protection operating profit by 3m for 2011.
Investment projects predominantly relate to Solvency II and other strategic investments.
Investment variances include 18m of restructuring costs relating to a number of reorganisation initiatives around the Group, including the restructure of the International segment.
This supplementary operating profit information one of the Groups key performance indicators provides further analysis of the results reported under IFRS and we believe gives shareholders a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business.
During the year, the Group has changed the management lines of the international subsidiaries to reflect the development of our international strategy.
This has had the consequence of changing the reportable segments of the Group as outlined below.
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the prior period segmental information has been restated to reflect these changes.
Operating profit for the Protection and Annuities segment represents the profit from the annuities business individual and bulk purchase annuities and longevity insurance and the profit from the housing and protection businesses general insurance, and individual and group protection business.
It also includes Legal & General France LGF and Legal & General Netherlands LGN.
Operating profit reflects the investment returns that the business expects to make on the financial investments that back this business and on shareholder funds retained within our general insurance business.

It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares.
For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax derived from continuing operations.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees.
Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.

A description of the principal products offered by the Groups segments is outlined below.
The Group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through control techniques which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board.
The Groups risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 44 to 51.
Details of the risks associated with the Groups principal products and the control techniques used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 15.
Protection and annuities The Groups Protection and Annuities business comprises annuities, individual and group protection, general insurance products and the businesses in France LGF and Netherlands LGN.
The majority of Protection and Annuity products are non-participating contracts and as such profits on this business accrue solely to shareholders.
Annuities Annuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment.
No surrender value is available under any of these products.
Immediate and deferred annuity contracts are offered.
Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase.
The income stream from a deferred annuity is delayed until a specified future date.
Bulk annuities are also offered, where the Group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund.
A small portfolio of immediate annuities has been written as participating business.
Some non-participating deferred annuities sold by the Group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting.
The value of such guaranteed options are currently immaterial.
There is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK non profit business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases.
In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative.
The total of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2012 was 301m 2011: 271m.
Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately 3m 2011: 3m.
Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs.
Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.
Deferred annuity contracts The Group has written some deferred annuity contracts with guaranteed minimum pensions.
These options expose the Group to interest rate and longevity risk as the cost would be expected to increase with decreasing interest rates and improved longevity.
Themarket consistent value of these guarantees carried in the balance sheet is 175m 2011: 185m.
Protection business individual and group The Group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits.
They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits: these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately.
The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms.
Some sickness benefits cover the policyholders mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates.
In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.
General insurance The Group offers Household and Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU products: Household.
These contracts provide cover in respect of policyholders homes, investment properties, contents, personal belongings and incidental liabilities which they may incur as a property owner, occupier and individual.
Exposure is normally limited to the rebuilding cost of the home, the replacement cost of belongings and a policy limit in respect of liability claims.
Accident, Sickness and Unemployment ASU.
These contracts provide cover in respect of continuing payment liabilities incurred by customers when they are unable to work as a result of accident, sickness or unemployment.
They protect predominantly mortgage payments.
Exposure is limited to the monthly payment level selected by the customer sufficient to cover the payment and associated costs, up to the duration limit specified in the policy, usually 12 months.

Since 1993, the DMI contract has included a maximum period of cover of ten years, and a cap on the maximum claim.
For business accepted prior to 1993, cover is unlimited and lasts until the insured property is remortgaged or redeemed.
During 2012 the Group also commenced the sale of pet insurance products.
Legal & General France LGF and Legal & General Netherlands LGN In addition to protection products, LGF and LGN also write savings business.
In LGF this includes unit linked savings, including shares of open ended investment vehicles SICAvS, risks for which are borne by unit holders of these funds, Euro denominated funds with 100% profit sharing clause and bank based investment accounts.
In LGN this includes unit linked and index linked savings products, bank based investment accounts and corporate pension products.
Certain savings products include an exposure to interest rate and credit risk, managed through an active asset-liability managementprogramme.
savings A range of contracts are offered in a variety of different forms to meet customers long term savings objectives.
Policyholders may choose to include a number of protection benefits within their savings contracts.
Typically, any guarantees under the contract would only apply on maturity or earlier death.
On certain older contracts there may be provisions guaranteeing surrender benefits.
Savings contracts may or may not guarantee policyholders an investment return.
The contracts fall into three main types: Non-participating savings, pensions and endowment contracts: Participating savings business, comprising endowment contracts and with-profits bonds: Unit linked savings contracts, unit trusts and collective investment savings products.
Non-participating business is written in the non profit part of the Society Long Term Fund LTF.
Profits accrue solely to shareholders.
Participating contracts are supported by the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
They offer policyholders the possibility of payment of benefits in addition to those guaranteed by the contract.
The amount and timing of the additional benefits usually called bonuses are contractually at the discretion of the Group.
For unit linked savings contracts, unit trusts and collective investment savings products, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders and therefore detailed risk disclosures have not been presented in respect of the associated assets and liabilities.
Unit linked business is written in the Society LTF.
Unit trust and collective investment business is administered by Legal & General Unit Trust Managers Limited and Legal & General Portfolio Management Services Limited, respectively.
Pensions individual and corporate These are long term savings contracts through which policyholders accumulate pension benefits.
Some older contracts contain a basic guaranteed benefit expressed as an amount of pension payable or a guaranteed annuity option.
Other options provided by these contracts include an open market option on maturity, early retirement and late retirement.
The Group would generally have discretion over the terms on which the latter types of options are offered.
Endowment policies These contracts provide a lump sum on maturity determined by the addition of annual and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a minimum sum assured death benefit.
With-profits bonds These contracts provide an investment return to the policyholder which is determined by the attribution of regular and final bonuses over the duration of the contract.
In addition, the contracts provide a death benefit, typically of 101% of the value of the units allocated to the policyholder.

These bonuses are determined in accordance with the principles outlined in the Groups PPFM for the management of the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The principles include: The with-profits part of the Society LTF will be managed with the objective of ensuring that its assets are sufficient to meet its liabilities without the need for additional capital: With-profits policies have no expectation of any distribution from the with-profits part of the Society LTFs inherited estate.
The inherited estate is the excess of assets held within the Society LTF over and above the amount required to meet liabilities, including those which arise from the regulatory duty to treat customers fairly in settling discretionary benefits: and Bonus rates will be smoothed so that some of the short term fluctuations in the value of the investments of the with-profits part oftheSociety LTF and the business results achieved in the with-profits part of the UK LTF are not immediately reflected in payments under with-profits policies.
At 30 June 2005 an assessment was made of the expected cost of guarantees and options to be paid in the future, and funds with thesame value to meet these costs were allocated from the capital in the with-profits sub-fund.
The value of the funds is regularly assessed and is reduced by the cost of guarantees and options paid since 1 July 2005.
At each assessment point, if the value of the funds is lower than the expected cost of guarantees and options, it is possible to make deductions from asset shares to cover the difference.
It is intended to limit deductions to no more than 0.75% each year, up to a maximum of 5% per policy.
Following the movement in the expected cost of guarantees and options and the value of the associated funds up to 31 December 2012, and in accordance with the Societys PPFM, a refund of 0.75% was made to the asset shares.
This followed a deduction of 0.75% made in respect of the year to 31 December 2011.
In the technical provisions, allowance was also made for future deductions in respect of the expected costs of meeting future guarantees and options not covered by the current year deduction.
For policyholders who decide to surrender, a charge will generally be made in respect of the expected cost of guarantees and options not covered by the charge already taken.
Some older participating contracts include a guaranteed minimum rate of roll up of the policyholders fund up tothe date of retirement or maturity.
The distribution of surplus to shareholders depends upon the bonuses declared for the period.
Typically, bonus rates are set having regard to investment returns, although the Group has some discretion setting rates and would normally smooth bonuses over time.
The volatility of investment returns could impact the funds capital position and its ability to pay bonuses.
If future investment conditions were less favourable than anticipated, the lower bonus levels resulting would also reduce future distributions to shareholders.
Business which is written in the with-profits part of the Society LTF is managed to be self-supporting.
The unallocated divisible surplus in the fund would normally be expected to absorb the impact of these investment risks.
Only in extreme scenarios, where shareholders were required to provide support to the with-profits part of the Society LTF to meet its liabilities, would these risksaffect equity.
As part of the 2007 Society LTF restructure, the 1996 Sub-fund 321m was merged into the Shareholder Retained Capital SRC.
As a result, Societys Board of Directors undertook to initially maintain 500m of assets within Society to support the with-profits business.
The amount of the commitment reduced to 300m in 2012 and will then gradually reduce to zero over a period not exceeding six years.
The Groups approach to setting bonus rates is designed to treat customers fairly.
The approach is set out in the Societys PPFM for the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
In addition, bonus declarations are also affected by FSA regulations relating to Treating Customers Fairly TCF, which limit the discretion available when setting bonus rates.

Us Protection Protection business Protection consists of individual term assurance, which provide death benefits over the medium to long term.
The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter.
During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract.
After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age related guaranteed premium.
Reinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims.
These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the Groups balance sheet.
Within LGA, reinsurance and securitisation is also used to provide regulatory solvency relief including relief from regulation Triple X term insurance reserves and regulation AXXX universal life reserves.
Universal life Universal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long term.
The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate.
LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate.
LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.
The reserves for universal life totalled $679m at 31 December 2012 $688m at 31 December 2011.
The guaranteed interest rates associated with those reserves ranged from 1.5% to 6%, with the majority of the policies having guaranteed rates ranging from 3% to 4% 2011: 3% to 4%.
Annuities Immediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by the Protection and Annuities division.
Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.
The reserves for immediate annuities and deferred annuities totalled $12m and $195m respectively at 31 December 2012 $12m and $200m at 31 December 2011 respectively.

The Group is exposed to asset risk on shareholders equity supporting the non profit Protection and Annuities and Savings businesses and capital within the Groups treasury function.
Risks attributable to Group capital and financing assets are outlined below.
Shareholder Funds Shareholder assets include portfolios of equity, property, bond and other investments, not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders.
The value of, and income from, these assets is sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy.
Potential volatility in returns are managed using a range of techniques, including performance benchmarks and limits on concentrations of exposures by asset type and geographic region.
Group Treasury and Liquidity Management The Groups treasury function manages the Groups banking relationships, capital raising activities, overall cash and liquidity position and the payment of dividends.
The Group seeks to manage its corporate funds and liquidity requirements on a pooled basis and to ensure the Group maintains sufficient liquid assets and standby facilities to meet a prudent estimate of its net cash outflows.
In addition, it ensures that, even under adverse conditions, the Group has access to the funds necessary to cover surrenders, withdrawals and maturing liabilities.
As at 31 December 2012, the Group had in place a 1bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in October 2017.

Unit linked business is written in both theSociety LTF and in the LTF of PMC.
The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders.
The Group is, therefore, notdirectly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.

The bonuses are broadly based onhistoric and current rates of return on equity, property and fixed income securities, as well as expectations of future investment returns.
With-profits also includes participating business in the LGF operation which shares similar characteristics.
The with-profits classification excludes unit linked contracts.

The Group classifies its financial investments on initial recognition as held for trading HFT, designated at fair value through profit or loss FvTPL, availableforsale AFS or loans and receivables.
Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.
The Groups policy is to measure investments at FvTPL except for certain overseas assets where the related liability is valued on apassive basis not using current information, in which case investments are classified as AFS.
All derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT.
Certain financial investments held by the Group are designated as FvTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the Groups investment strategy.
Assets designated as FvTPL include debt securities and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS under IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Assets backing participating and nonparticipating policyholder liabilities outside the US are designated as FvTPL.
For participating contracts the assets are managed on a fair value basis to maximise the total return to policyholders over the contract life.
The Groups nonparticipating investment contract liabilities outside of the US are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FvTPL to avoid an accounting mismatch in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial investments are based on bid prices.
If the market for a financial investment is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques such as recent arms length transactions, consensus market pricing, reference to similar listed investments, discounted cash flow models or option pricing models.

The techniques used for determining fair value include earnings multiples, the price of a recent investment or a net asset basis.
Financial investments classified as HFT and FvTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the income statement.
Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity.
Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on nonequity instruments are reflected in the income statement.
Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.
Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus acquisition costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Future developments IFRS 9, Financial Instruments issued in November 2009 effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015 isthe first part of a new standard on classification and measurement of financial assets that will replace IAS 39.
IFRS 9 has two measurement categories: amortised cost and fair value.
All equity instruments are measured at fair value.
A debt instrument is at amortised cost only if the entity is holding it to collect contractual cash flows and the cash flows represent principal and interest, otherwise it must be measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Further amendments to IFRS 9, dealing with financial liabilities, were published in October 2010.
These include amortised cost accounting for most financial liabilities, with bifurcation of embedded derivatives.
The main change in the amendment is that in cases where the fair value option is taken for financial liabilities, the part of a fair value change due to an entitys own credit risk is recorded in other comprehensive income rather than the income statement, unless this creates an accounting mismatch.
The Group does not intend to early adopt this standard.
IFRS 13, Fair value Measurement effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 provides clarity over the definition and disclosure of fair value, which can then be applied across all accounting standards.
This standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.

The Group is able to substitute the constituents of the original reference portfolios with new reference assets, allowing the management of the underlying credit risk although substitutions in 2011 were limited and there have been no substitutions in 2012.
A breakdown of the underlying CDO reference portfolio by sector is provided below: 2012 2011 sector % % Banks 14 14 Utilities 10 10 Consumer Services & Goods 25 25 Financial Services 6 6 Technology & Telecoms 9 9 Insurance 6 6 Industrials 20 20 Oil & Gas 6 6 Health Care 4 4 100 100 The CDOs are termed as super senior since default losses on the reference portfolio have to exceed 27.6%, on average across the four CDOs, before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Assuming an average recovery rate of 30%, then over 39% of the reference names would have to default before the CDOs incur any default losses.
Beyond 27.6% of default losses on the reference portfolio, losses to the CDO would occur at a rate that is a multiple of the loss rate on the reference portfolio.
For illustration a 200m loss could be incurred if default losses to the reference portfolios exceeded 30.5% or if 43.6% of the names in the diversified global investment grade portfolio defaulted, with an average 30% recovery rate.
All figures are averages across the four CDOs.
The underlying reference portfolio has had no reference entity defaults in 2011 or 2012.
Losses are limited under the terms of the CDOs to assets and collateral invested.
These CDOs also incorporate features under which, in certain circumstances, the Group can choose either to post additional cash collateral or to allow wind up of the structures.
These features are dependant on the portfolios weighted average spreads, default experience to date and time to maturity.
No additional collateral was posted to any of the CDOs during the year ended 31 December 2012 2011: nil.
During the period, the Group received nil 2011: nil of previously posted collateral.
These CDOs are valued using an external valuation which is based on observable market inputs.
This is then validated against the internal valuation.

iv Fair value hierarchy Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged or a liability settled between knowledgeable willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Fair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs.
Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Groups view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.
The Group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.
The levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows: Level 1: fair values measured using quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : Level 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have classified them as level 2.
Accordingly, these assets have also been classified in level 2.
Level 3 assets, where internal models are used to represent a small proportion of assets to which shareholders are exposed, and reflect unquoted equities including investments in private equity, property vehicles and suspended securities.
In many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy.
In these situations, the Group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.
As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the Group has classified within level 3.
The Group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available.
The Group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate.
As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the Groups credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.

Illiquid market conditions have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the Groups financial instruments.
As a result, there is generally no or limited observable market data for these assets and liabilities.
Fair value estimates for financial instruments deemed to be in an illiquid market are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, currency, credit and interest rate risks, loss experience and other factors.
These fair values are estimates and involve considerable uncertainty and variability as a result of the inputs selected and may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed, and the differences could be material.
As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realisable in an immediate sale or settlement of the instrument.
In addition, changes in the underlying assumptions used in the fair value measurement technique could significantly affect these fair value estimates.
Fair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker.
These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee.

The Group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group useshedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39 are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fairvalue or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item.
The Groups principal uses of hedge accounting are to: i recognise in shareholders equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Any cumulative gains and or losses are recognised in the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation: ii defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur: and iii hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations.
Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
The relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction.
The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis.
Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges between 80% and 125% effectiveness with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the income statement, within other expenses, in the current period.
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Where the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the income statement.
There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classified as AFS.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The table below provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired.

The approach to the management of operational risks, including loss arising from trading errors, breach offund management guidelines or valuation errors, where a breakdown in controls could lead to successful litigation against the company by one or more clients, is set out in Note 25.
accumulation of risks There is limited potential for single incidents to give rise to a large number of claims across the different contract types written by the Group.
In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long term and short term insurance business written by the Group.
However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure.
These correlations are difficult to estimate though they would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios became more extreme.
An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.
16 long term insurance valuation assumPtions The Groups insurance assumptions, described below, relate exclusively to the UK insurance business.
The non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the Groups operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.
non-participating business For its non-participating business the Group seeks to make prudent assumptions about its future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience.
The approach used to set non-participating assumptions is generally similar to that used to determine the assumptions used for FSA statutory Peak 1, although the actual assumptions may sometimes differ from those used for regulatory reporting purposes.
These assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.
valuation rates of interest and discount rates The valuation interest rate for each contract type is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract adjusted for the risk that asset proceeds are not received by the Group.
For some business, this yield is the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities and therunning yield on variable interest securities.
For other business it is the Internal Rate of Return on the portfolio of backing assets.

indd 159 16 03 2013 03:29 Financial statements Balance sheet management continued 16 long term insurance valuation assumPtions continued In 2012, the Group continued to hold an additional reserve to protect against the risk of an uplift in defaults in the current economic environment and also maintained the level of the long term default allowance at 40bps 2011: 40bps per annum for unapproved securities backing non profit business, 35bps 2011: 35bps per annum for unapproved securities backing with-profits business, 5bps 2011: 3bps perannum for approved securities and swaps backing non profit business, 3bps 2011: 3bps per annum for approved securities and swaps backing with-profit business.
For unapproved securities backing non profit annuity business, the credit default allowances equate to 60bps 2011: 61bps per annum when experienced over the duration of the assets held, leading to an overall total default provision of 1.7bn 2011: 1.6bn.
A similar methodology has been used for assets backing non-participating with-profits business.
The Group believes the total default allowance is prudent to cover all reasonably foreseeable circumstances.
For equity investments, the yield is based on the current dividend yield, adjusted for prudence.
For property holdings, yields are based on the rental income payable calculated by considering different categories of tenant separately, adjusted for the possibility of default.
Default rates used in the calculations vary by tenant category.
mortality and morbidity Mortality and morbidity assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau CMIB of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
These tables are based on industry-wide experience.
The majority of internal statistical investigations are carried out at least annually to determine the extent to which the Groups experience differs from that of the industry and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.
Persistency The Group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually.
Persistency can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.
The Group tries to balance past experience and future conditions by making prudent assumptions about the future expected long term average persistency levels.
For non-participating contracts where explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.
expenses The Group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business.
Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the Groups business plan.
An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made, taking account of both salary and price information.
Participating business For its participating business, the Group seeks to establish its liabilities at their realistic value in line with the requirements set out inFRS 27.
Non-economic assumptions are set to represent the Groups best estimates of future experience.

The model is calibrated using market data from avariety of market sources.
This enables assumptions to be determined for the term structure of risk free interest rates, property andequity volatility.
Risk free interest rates are determined with reference to the gilt yield curve on the valuation date increased bytenbasis points.
Property volatility is set with reference to historic variations in property prices.
Equity volatility is set so that the model reproduces observed market prices of traded equity derivatives.
Correlations between asset classes are based on historic data.
Each investment scenario contains a consistent set of assumptions for investment returns and inflation.
Future bonuses Future reversionary and terminal bonuses are consistent with the bonus policies set out in Societys Principles and Practices ofFinancial Management PPFM.
value of in-force non-participating contracts The Group makes a deduction from the liabilities for the expected value of future profits arising on non-participating contracts writtenin the with-profits part of the Society LTF.
The economic assumptions used to calculate the value of these profits are consistent with those used to calculate liabilities for with-profits business, with the addition of a liquidity premium in respect of assets backing non-participating annuity business.
Non-economic assumptions represent best estimates of expected future experience on this business.
An explicit allowance is madefor non-market risk.
guaranteed annuity options The guarantees are valued on a market consistent basis.
The valuation methodology allows for the correlation between interest ratesand the proportion of the policyholders who take up the option.
guaranteed cash options The liability is determined assuming that policyholders choose the most valuable alternative between the annuity and cash available atretirement.

For contracts where the policyholder has the option to vary the rate of premium, theprovision is taken as being the higher of the amount calculated as if the policyholder continues to make premium payments or, alternatively, ceases to pay premiums altogether.
Persistency non-participating business Lapse rates are used in the valuation of certain classes of long term business.
Where this is the case, the valuation persistency basis isset by applying a prudential margin over the best estimate assumptions.
The tables below show the major products where lapse rates have been used.
For term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policys lifetime when itistreated as an asset but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policys lifetime when it is treated as a liability.
The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.
Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, usingthe valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.
For unitised business, the margin acts to either increase or decrease the best estimate lapse rates, depending upon which approach results in the higher liability.
The direction of the margin is assessed for unit life business and unit pensions business separately.
A summary of the lapse basis for major classes of business participating and non-participating, as defined by the requirements oftheannual returns to the FSA, is shown below.

indd 164 16 03 2013 03:29 OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR APPROACH GOVERnAnCE FInAnCIAl StAtEmEntS OtHER InFORmAtIOn Balance sheet management continued UK long term business sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups long term insurance valuation assumptions disclosed in Note 16.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice, items of the Groups experience may be correlated.
The Group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
These stresses use the assets that back the liabilities.
Any excess assets have not been stressed in these calculations.
The sensitivity of the profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
The change in interest rate test assumes a 100 basis point change in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with a 100 basis point change in the real yields on variable securities.
Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of FSA regulations.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The inflation stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in inflation resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense inflation rate is increased by 1% pa.
The reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to that insurer.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 1% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
Default of largest reinsurer: The largest reinsurer was deduced at an entity level by mathematical reserves ceded.
The largest reinsurer is Swiss Re.
The increase in reserves is consistent with the reinsured reserves.
Details of IGD sensitivity analysis can be found in Table 2 of Note 26.
The Group also uses embedded value financial statements information to manage risk.
The effect of alternative assumptions on the long term embedded value, prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in October 2005 are contained within the Supplementary Financial Statements on page 233 of the Annual Report and Accounts.

indd 165 16 03 2013 03:29 Financial statements Balance sheet management continued 18 insurance contract liaBilities Insurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract.
A number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features DPF which entitle the policyholders to receive guaranteed benefits as well as additional benefits: the amount or timing of which is contractually at the discretion of the Group: and which are contractually based on: the performance of a specified pool of contracts or a specified type of contract: realised and or unrealised investment returns on a specified pool of assets held by the issuer: or the profit or loss of the Company, fund or other entity which issues the contract.
Contracts with DPF are referred to as participating contracts.
With-profits contracts in the UK and most Garantie Long Terme contracts in France are classified as participating.
long term insurance Under current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP, as permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance contracts.
uk In the UK, insurance contract liabilities are determined following an annual investigation of the long term funds LTFs in accordance with regulatory requirements.
For non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method.
This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs and contractually guaranteed benefits.
For unit linkedinsurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.
For participating contracts, the liabilities to policyholders are determined on a realistic basis in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 27, Life assurance.
This includes an assessment of the cost of any future options and guarantees granted to policyholders valued on a market consistent basis.
The calculation also takes account of bonus decisions which are consistent withLegal & General Assurance Society Limiteds Societys Principles and Practices of Financial Management PPFM.
Theshareholders share of the future cost of bonuses is excluded from the assessment of the realistic liability.
In determining the realistic value of liabilities for participating contracts, the value of future profits on non-participating business written in the with-profits part of the fund is accounted for as part of the calculation.
The present value of future profits VIF for thisbusiness is separately determined and its value is deducted from the sum of the liabilities for participating contracts and the unallocated divisible surplus.
Unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are received and non-unitised liabilities are recognised when premiums are due.
overseas The long term insurance contract liabilities for business transacted by overseas subsidiaries are determined on the basis of recognised actuarial methods which reflect local supervisory principles or, in the case of the US, on the basis of US GAAP.
general insurance Liabilities, together with related reinsurance recoveries, are established on the basis of current information.
Such liabilities can never be definitive as to their timing or the amount of claims and are therefore subject to subsequent reassessment on a regular basis.
Claims and related reinsurance recoveries are accounted for in respect of all incidents up to the year end.
Provision is made on the basis of available information for the estimated ultimate cost, including claims settlement expenses, claims reported but notyet settled and claims incurred but not yet reported.
An unexpired risk provision is made for any overall excess of expected claims and deferred acquisition costs over unearned premiums and after taking account of investment return.

When performing the liability adequacy test, the Group discounts all contractual cash flows and compares this amount with the carrying value of the liability.
Any deficiency is immediately charged to the income statement, initially reducing deferred acquisition costs and then by establishing a provision for losses.
reinsurance The Groups insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing.
Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period asthe related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured.
Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy.
Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the consolidated balance sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which casethe associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.

Amounts under unit linked contracts are generally repayable on demand and the Group is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient liquidity within the asset portfolio to enable liabilities to unit linked policyholders to be met as they fall due.
However, the terms of funds investing in less liquid assets permit the deferral of redemptions for predefined periods in circumstances where there are not sufficient liquid assets within the fund to meet the level of requested redemptions.
Accordingly, unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the table.

In the UK, participating investment contract liabilities are determined in accordance with FRS 27, including a value for guarantees, in the same way as participating insurance contracts.
Non-participating investment contracts are unit linked contracts.
Unit linked liabilities are measured at fair value by reference tothevalue of the underlying net asset values of the Groups unitised investment funds at the balance sheet date.
Claims are not included in the income statement but are deducted from investment contract liabilities.
The movement in investment contract liabilities consists of claims incurred in the period less the corresponding elimination of the policyholder liability originally recognised in the balance sheet and the investment return credited to policyholders.

Accordingly unit linked liabilities have been excluded from the reported cash flows.
A maturity analysis based on the earliest contractual repayment date would present investment contract liabilities as due on the earliest period of the table because policyholders can exercise cancellation options at their discretion.
In such a scenario, the liability would be reduced due to the application of surrender penalties.
20 unallocated divisiBle surPlus The participating funds operate with an excess of assets over the amount required to meet the policyholder liabilities.
The nature of benefits for the contracts within these funds is such that the allocation of surpluses between ordinary equity holders andparticipating policyholders is uncertain.
The amount of surplus which has not been allocated at the balance sheet date is classified within liabilities as the unallocated divisible surplus.
Adjustments made to comply with FRS 27 are charged to the unallocated divisible surplus.

Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.
Borrowings comprise unsecured subordinated debt such as tier 1 and tier 2 bond issues, short and long term unsecured senior debt suchas long dated bond issues, commercial paper issuance and bank borrowings under both committed and uncommitted debt facilities including bank overdrafts.
Borrowings secured on specific assets cash flows such as Triple X securitisations and private equity fund linked partnership assets are included as non recourse borrowings.
Mortgage loans raised by SIPP clients secured on those properties invested in their portfolio of linked SIPP investments which we manage on their behalf are treated as unit linked borrowings.

Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

indd 177 16 03 2013 03:29 Financial statements BAlAnce sheet MAnAgeMent continued 23 Provisions continued ii retirement benefit obligations continued The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the fund is not restricted.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the Group.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the income statement but through the statement of comprehensive income.
The benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The Group has no liability for retirement benefits other than for pensions, except for a small scheme in LGF Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire, which provides lump sum benefits on retirement.

For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date the liability is re-measured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash flows will be reflected in the fairvalue movement for a period.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation of the asset.

This liability has been determined using the net present value of the future commission which will be payable on fund values.
This valuation technique uses assumptions which are consistent with the Groups effective rate of interest, investment return assumptions and persistency assumptions used in other valuations, but it is not determined by reference to published price quotations.
The undiscounted value which is expected to be paid at maturity in respect of such commission is 248m 2011: 259m.
Payables and other financial liabilities settled after 12 months are expected to be settled within five years with the exception of derivative liabilities, as disclosed in Note 11.

In 2011, derivative liabilities of 203m classified as Level 3 comprised non profit non-linked interest rate contracts, which were transferred into Level 3 during the year due to the use of measurement inputs that were not based on observable market data.
The pricing of these derivatives was dependant on interest rate assumptions.
Using reasonably alternative assumptions would have resulted in an increase or decrease in fair value of 10m.
Trail commissions are modelled using expected cash flows, incorporating expected future persistency.
They have therefore been classified as Level 3 liabilities.
The entire movement in the balance has been reflected in the income statement during the year.

indd 181 16 03 2013 03:29 Financial statements Balance sheet management continued 25 oPerational risk Operational risk is defined as exposure to loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems, or from external events.
Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the Groups businesses.
All business managers are required to confirm regularly the adequacy of controls to mitigate those operational risks relevant to their responsibilities.
Significant control issues are escalated to senior and executive management through the Groups risk management framework.
The framework is supported by the Operational Risk Management teams which facilitates the identification, assessment, monitoring and control of risks across the Groups businesses.
There are a number of categories under which operational risk and its management across the Group can be considered, and these areoutlined in the following paragraphs.
internal process failure The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from failure of the internal processes with which it transacts its business.
Eachbusiness division is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the controls over its processes.
Regular reviews are undertaken oftheir appropriateness and effectiveness.
People The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of loss from inappropriate actions by its staff.
Recruitment is managed centrally by HRfunctions, and all new recruits undergo a formal induction programme.
All employees have job descriptions setting out their accountabilities and reporting lines, and are appraised annually in accordance with agreed performance management frameworks.
Employees in regulated subsidiaries are provided with appropriate training to enable them to meet the relevant regulatory requirements.
Risks relating to health and safety and other legislation are managed through the provision of relevant training to all staff.
outsourcing The Group is potentially exposed to the actions or failure of suppliers contracted to provide services on an outsourced basis.
TheGroup has defined minimum standards of control to be applied for all outsourced arrangements within a formal outsourcing andcritical supplier policy.
legal Legal risk is the risk of loss from unclear or deficient product documentation: inadequate documentation in support of material contracts such as reassurance treaties: the incorrect interpretation of changes in legislation: employment related disputes and claims: and commercial disputes with suppliers.
The risks are actively managed through the Group Legal Risk framework, which defines minimum standards of control to be applied to minimise the risk of loss.
compliance Compliance risk within the Group relates to the risk of non-adherence to legislative requirements, regulations and internal policies andprocedures.
Responsibility for ensuring adherence to relevant legal and regulatory requirements is vested in individual business managers.
A Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance function has oversight of the Groups compliance with conduct of business requirements and standards, providing policy advice and guidance and oversight of compliance arrangements and responsibilities.
event Event risk relates to the potential for loss arising from significant external events such as terrorism, financial crisis, major changes in fiscal systems or disaster.
Typically, such events have a low likelihood of occurrence, a material impact and can be difficult to prevent.
The Groups risk mitigation focuses on minimising the business disruption and potential financial loss which may ensue from such an event.
This includes maintaining a framework for the management of major incidents, the maintenance and regular testing of detailed business, technical and location recovery plans and the provision of insurance cover for the loss of buildings, contents and information technology systems and for the increased cost of working in the event of business disruption.

indd 182 16 03 2013 03:29 OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR APPROACH GOVERnAnCE FInAnCIAl StAtEmEntS OtHER InFORmAtIOn Balance sheet management continued Fraud The Group is potentially exposed to the risk of internal fraud, claims-related fraud, and external action by third parties.
The risk of internal fraud is managed through a number of processes including the screening of staff at recruitment, segregation of duties and management oversight.
The activities of Internal Audit also act to counter the risk.
Claims-related fraud is managed by ensuring business processes are designed to fully validate claims and ensure that only bona fide claims are settled.
Anti-fraud techniques areregularly updated to mitigate risks and emerging threats.
The Groups approach to mitigating fraud and other dishonest acts is supported by promoting an open and honest culture in all dealings between employees, managers and those parties with which the Group has contact.
A formal code of ethics sets out the Groups expectations in this respect.
Effective and honest communication isessential if malpractice is to be effectively dealt with.
The Group has defined whistle blowing procedures to enable all employees and those who work with Legal & General to raise matters of concern relating to Legal & General in confidence.
technology The Group places a high degree of reliance on IT in its business activities.
The failure of IT systems could potentially expose the Group tosignificant business disruption and loss.
To mitigate this risk, standards and methodologies for developing, testing and operating ITsystems are maintained.
Disaster recovery facilities enable IT operations to be conducted at remote locations in the event of the lossof computer facilities.
All records are remotely backed up and computer suites are equipped with alternative power sources.
contagion The potential for contagion risk arises as a consequence of the use of a common brand across the majority of the Group and the provision of intra-group loans and indemnities.
The Group has defined policies and procedures for managing matters that may have reputational implications, to ensure that Legal & Generals position is correctly understood.
The Group also has defined policies forthe provision of guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort.
26 management oF caPital resources capital structure The Groups total capital resources of 8.4bn 2011: 7.9bn on an IFRS basis comprise equity holders capital, 5.4bn 2011: 5.1bn, subordinated debt 1.8bn 2011: 1.8bn, and unallocated divisible surplus, 1.2bn 2011: 1.0bn.
From a regulatory perspective the Group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on an ongoing basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which we operate.
At 31 December 2012, Legal & Generals unaudited Insurance Group Directive IGD capital resources were 4.1bn 2011: 3.8bn in excess of capital requirements of 3.1bn 2011: 3.1bn, representing a solvency coverage ratio of 234% 2011: 220%.
This surplus capital is after accruing for a 2012 final dividend of 336m 2011: 279m.
The Group writes a range of long term insurance and investment business in the long term fund LTF of its main operating insurance subsidiary, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited Society.
This fund is segregated from the Groups other assets.
The fund includes participating with-profits business where policyholders and shareholders share in the risks and rewards, and non-participating non profit business, where the shareholders receive profits or incur losses.
Capital in excess of the amount required to cover the liabilities is currently held within Society.
This capital provides support for new and existing non profit business within our UK non profit Protection and Annuities and Savings businesses.
The non-linked, non profit pensions and annuity business of Society is ceded, on arms length terms, to a wholly owned Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle ISPV, Legal & General Pensions Limited LGPL.
Whilst an ISPV is not required to segregate policyholder assets within a LTF, LGPL continues to manage policyholder and shareholder assets separately for internal purposes.
Managed pension fund business is written through Legal & General Assurance Pensions Management Limited PMC, which is a lifecompany writing predominantly non-participating group pension business effected by trustees of occupational schemes in the UK or their equivalent overseas.
The assets are held in a LTF and are separate from other assets within the Group.
In addition, the Group operates two UK long term insurance businesses acquired in 2008 Nationwide Life Limited and Suffolk Life Annuities Limited.
General insurance business is written in the UK by Legal & General Insurance Limited, and long term insurance business is also written by LGA, LGN and LGF.

The Group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.
capital measures The Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the Group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business.
The measures used bythe Group include: Accounting bases Management use the primary financial statements prepared on an IFRS basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.
In addition, the supplementary accounts prepared using EEV principles provide further insight into the value of the business to shareholders.
Accordingly the Groups net asset value and total capital employed are also analysed and measured on this basis.
Regulatory bases The financial strength of the Groups insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements see below.
Oneof these regulatory measures, Individual Capital Assessment ICA, measures capital using risk based stochastic techniques, andprovides a measure of the level of economic capital required to run the Groups business.
Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements In each country in which the Group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by long term insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities.
The minimum required capital must be maintained at all times throughout the year.
This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.
The required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance companys liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance companys liabilities and risk exposures.
The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the Group operates are detailed below: UK regulatory basis Required capital for the life business is based on FSA rules.
Society must hold assets in excess of the higher of two amounts: the first being calculated using the FSA rules specified by the Regulator pillar 1, the second being an economic capital assessment by the Company which is reviewed by the FSA pillar 2, otherwise known as ICA.
The public pillar 1 capital calculation is calculated by applying fixed percentages to liabilities and sums assured at risk or setting aside a proportion of expenses Peak 1.
There are further stress tests for participating business, as measured in the Realistic Balance Sheet Peak 2, which may increase the required capital under Peak 1 calculations.
The private pillar 2 capital calculation is an assessment of the economic capital required to ensure that the Company can meet itsliabilities, with a high likelihood, as they fall due.
This is achieved by application of stochastic modelling and scenario testing.
Theresult is reviewed and may be modified by the FSA.
Regulatory capital for the general insurance business is also calculated using FSA pillar 1 and pillar 2 requirements.
The pillar 1 calculation applies fixed percentages to premiums and claims.
Pillar 2 creates a higher capital requirement and is therefore applied inthis business.
US regulatory basis Required capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital RBC based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model.
RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile.
The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.

indd 184 16 03 2013 03:29 OVERVIEW OUR PROGRESS OUR APPROACH GOVERnAnCE FInAnCIAl StAtEmEntS OtHER InFORmAtIOn Balance sheet management continued French and Dutch regulatory bases The minimum required capital is defined by the French Ministry of Finances Code des Assurances and the fide Nederlandsche Bank N. V. Dutch Supervisory Body respectively.
The basis of the calculation is a percentage of the liabilities plus a percentage of the sum assured at risk and, for some contracts, the premium.
The percentages depend on the guarantees given and the amount of reinsurance cover.
Group regulatory basis In addition to the regulatory capital calculations for the individual firms, the Group is required to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
available regulatory capital resources Capital resources available to meet regulatory UK capital requirements are determined using FSA valuation rules.
The asset valuation rules are based on UK GAAP, adjusted for admissibility, counterparty exposure limits and specific valuation differences.
The Groups regulatory capital position statement in Table 1 sets out the different sources of capital held within the Group.
The Groups total available capital resources, based on unaudited FSA returns, are 6.6bn 2011: 6.0bn of which 4.2bn 2011: 4.1bn is held by the life businesses.
The use of capital held by the UK and overseas life businesses is generally constrained by local regulatory requirements, and may not be available to provide funding for other businesses.
The total available capital resources of the Groups with-profits business with-profits estate is determined in accordance with the Realistic Balance Sheet rules prescribed by the FSA.
At 31 December 2012, the realistic value of the UK participating liabilities was 14.0bn 2011: 14.6bn under the FSA realistic capital regime.
The excess of realistic assets over realistic liabilities was 0.7bn 2011: 0.7bn.
The capital resources reflect the surplus in that part of the fund which is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
The liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet do not include the amount representing the shareholders share of future bonuses.

Available regulatory capital resource risks The Groups available capital resources are sensitive to changes in market conditions, both to changes in the value of the assets and to the impact which changes in investment conditions may have on the value of the liabilities.
Capital resources are also sensitive to assumptions and experience relating to mortality and morbidity and, to a lesser extent, expenses and persistency.
The most significant sensitivities arise from the following four risks: market risk in relation to UK participating business which would crystallise if adverse changes in the value of the assets supporting this business could not be fully reflected in payments to policyholders because of the effect of guarantees and options.
The capital position of this business would also deteriorate if increases to the market cost of derivatives resulted in an increase in the liability forguarantees and options in the realistic balance sheet.
market risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the return from the fixed interest investments supporting this business were lower than that assumed for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK annuity business, which would crystallise if the mortality of annuitants improved more rapidly thanthe assumptions used for reserving.
mortality risk in relation to the UK and US term assurance businesses, which would crystallise if mortality of the lives insured washigher than that assumed, possibly because of an epidemic.
A range of management actions is available to mitigate any adverse impact from changing market conditions and experience, including changes to with-profits bonus rates, changes to discretionary surrender terms and charging for guarantees.
To the extent that management actions are expected only to offset partially adverse experience, then liabilities would be increased to anticipate thefuture impact of the adverse experience and total capital resources would be reduced.

The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity.
On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the Group is transferred to retained earnings.
Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.
i description of schemes The Group provides a number of equity settled share-based long term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.
The Savings related share option scheme SAYE allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over either three, five or seven years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the Group.
The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the Group shares on the invitation date.
Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.
Conditional shares can be granted to top managers under the Performance share plan PSP, based upon individual and Company performance.
Under the PSP, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period is dependent on the Groups relative Total Shareholder Return TSR.
The Company share option scheme CSOP, approved by HMRC, and unapproved Executive share option scheme ESOS are designed to provide a long term incentive to directors and managers of the Group.
The number of options granted is based on the managers grade, salary and performance.
In order for the options to be exercisable, Legal & Generals TSR must exceed the median TSR of the FTSE 100 for a period of at least three years commencing on the date of the grant.
Fair value is calculated using a binomial model, reflecting the historic exercise patterns.
The Share bonus plan SBP awards restricted shares and nil-paid options.
Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends.
Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments.
Under the Employee share plan ESP, approved by HMRC, permanent UK employees may elect to purchase Group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis.
The Group supplements the number of shares purchased by matching the first 20 of the employees contributions.
From time to time, the Group may make a grant of free shares.
Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years before they may vest to the employee.
The fair value of granted shares is equal to the market value at grant date.

During the year, two funds 2011: nil were seeded in this manner and met the above classification.
Consequently the assets and liabilities of these funds have been classified as held for sale.

45 share capital, share premium and employee scheme treasury shares An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the Group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any Group entity purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.

The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them.
Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them.
The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the FSA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.
Various Group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time.
The relevant members of the Group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities.
The provisions made are regularly reviewed.
It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.
In 1975, Legal & General Assurance Society Limited the Society was required by the Institute of London Underwriters ILU to execute the ILU form of guarantee in respect of policies issued through the ILUs Policy Signing Office on behalf of NRG Victory Reinsurance Company Ltd Victory, a company which was then a subsidiary of the Society.
In 1990, Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep Holding NV the assets and liabilities of which have since been assumed by Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV under a statutory merger in the Netherlands acquired Victory and provided an indemnity to the Society against any liability the Society may have as a result of the ILUs requirement, and the ILU agreed that its requirement of the Society would not apply to policies written or renewed after the acquisition.
Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep NV is now owned by Columbia Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Whether the Society has any liability as a result of the ILUs requirement and, if so, the amount of its potential liability is uncertain.
The Society has made no payment or provision in respect of this matter.
Group companies have given indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions.
