The following external factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and areas where we make decisions on the basis of information that is incomplete or uncertain.
1 Commodity prices During FY2012, commodity markets were influenced by ongoing, unresolved sovereign debt concerns in Europe, a continuing gradual slowdown in China and uncertainty about the pace and sustainability of the US recovery, among other factors.
In the case of steelmaking raw materials, Chinese demand growth decelerated, and combined with robust supply growth from seaborne sources, resulted in lower raw material prices than the previous year.
The metals commodities attracted lower prices than the previous year as a result of declining demand in Europe and slower demand growth in China.
For energy commodities, geopolitical tensions provided price support for crude oil, while US gas prices declined with unfavourable supply and demand conditions, despite significant coal to gas switching in the power sector.
The following table shows prices of our most significant commodities for the years ended 30 June 2012, 2011 and 2010.
These prices represent selected quoted prices from the relevant sources as indicated.
These prices will differ from the realised prices on the sale of the Groups production due to differences in quotational periods, quality of products, delivery terms and the range of quoted prices that are used for contracting sales in different markets.
