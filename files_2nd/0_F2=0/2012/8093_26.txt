DIVIDEND Informa usually pays a dividend to all shareholders twice each year.
Informa operates a Dividend Access Plan which is open to all its shareholders.
Those shareholders who hold fewer than 100,000 shares are deemed to consent to receive their dividends from a UK resident Informa company.
However if a shareholder holding over 100,000 shares wishes to do so may elect to join the Dividend Access Plan by completing an Election Form.
This form is available from Informas Registrars by calling 0870 707 4040, if you are calling from outside the UK please call: 44 870 707 4040.
If you hold over 100,000 shares and do not elect to join the Dividend Access Plan you will receive your dividends from Informa plc which is domiciled in Switzerland.
