The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken direct to equity of 1.3m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since the inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the group statement of comprehensive income before 4 October 2004.
Normal contributions of 1.0m are expected to be paid into the dened benefit pension schemes during the 2013 financial year.
Additional contributions of 14.0m are expected to be paid into the dened benefit pension schemes during the 2013 financial year, of which 9.0m is expected to be paid by the group and 5.0m will be received from the pension funding partnership structure.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Overview The groups principal financial instruments comprise derivatives, borrowings and overdrafts, and cash and cash equivalents.
These financial instruments are used to manage interest rate and currency exposures, funding and liquidity requirements and share price exposure arising under the groups employee incentive schemes.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the groups operations include trade receivables and payables see notes 18 and 24 respectively.
It is, and has always been, the groups policy that no derivative is entered into for trading or speculative purposes.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Additionally, the group is exposed to commodity price risk and share price risk.
The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks as summarised below.
Interest rate risk The groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the groups long-term debt obligations with oating interest rates.
The groups policy is to manage its interest cost by maintaining a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
The groups policy is to have an average over the next three years of between 25% and 80% of its borrowings at xed rates of interest.
To manage this, the group enters into interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements which are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
At 30 September 2012 after taking into account the effect of these instruments, approximately 86% of the groups borrowings are at a xed rate of interest 2011: 82%.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk table The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, on the groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings and equity through the change in fair values of applicable derivative instruments.

The group has operations in euro-denominated countries and nances these partly through the use of foreign currency borrowings and cross currency swaps which hedge the translation risk of net investments in foreign operations.
Additionally cash generation from euro-denominated operations can be utilised to meet euro payment obligations in sterling denominated companies, providing a natural hedge.
The group also has transactional exposures arising from purchases of prime materials, capital expenditure and interest costs in currencies other than the functional currency of the individual group entities.
Non functional currency purchases and interest costs are made in the currencies of US dollars and euros.
As at 30 September 2012 the group has hedged 69% 2011: 67% of forecast net exposures 12 months in advance using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Where funding is raised in a currency other than the currency ultimately required by the group, cross currency interest rate swaps are used to convert the cash ows to the required currency.
These swaps have the same duration and other critical terms as the underlying borrowing.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and euro exchange rates, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities and the groups equity due to changes in fair value of forward exchange contracts.

Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Credit risk The group trades only with recognised creditworthy third parties.
It is the groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount disclosed in note 18.
For transactions that do not occur in the country of the relevant operating unit, the group does not offer credit terms without the approval of the Head of Finance Shared Services.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
The group maintains a policy on counterparty credit exposures with banks and financial institutions arising from the use of derivatives and financial instruments.
This policy restricts the investment of surplus funds and entering into derivatives to counterparties with a minimum credit rating maintained by either Moodys, Standard & Poors or Fitch.
The level of exposure with counterparties at various ratings levels is also restricted under this policy.
The level of exposure and the credit worthiness of the groups banking counterparties is reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with this policy.
Commodity price risk The main commodity price risk arises in the purchases of prime materials, being PET, sugar, steel and frozen concentrated orange juice.
Where it is considered commercially advantageous, the group enters into xed price contracts with suppliers to hedge against unfavourable commodity price changes.
Share schemes equity price risk The group operates several employee incentive share schemes.
It has an exposure to the share price for the schemes in which shares are purchased in the market to satisfy the requirements of the plan.
To hedge this risk the group has entered into a number of total return share swaps against schemes maturing in 2012 and 2013.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Britvic plc share price, with all other variables held constant, of the groups profit before tax due to changes in the fair value of the share swaps.
Increase Effect on decrease in profit before share price tax % m 2012 10 1.5 10 1.5 2011 10 1.9 10 1.9 Liquidity risk The group monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using rolling cash ow forecasts.
These forecasts consider the maturity of both its financial investments and financial assets e. g. accounts receivable, other financial assets and projected cash ows from operations.
The objective of the groups liquidity policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funds and exibility through the use of bank loans and overdrafts and long term private placement issuance.
The bank loans entered into under the 400m bank facility are unsecured however 1.4m of outstanding Britvic France bank loans are secured.
At 30 September 2012, 0.3m of the groups debt will mature in less than one year 2011: none.

Details with regard to derivative contracts are included in note 26.
All bank loans outstanding at year end were secured loans from inception.
Fair value hierarchy The group uses the following valuation hierarchy to determine the carrying value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
