PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES FACING THE COMPANY At the balance sheet date, the Company was exposed to a maximum credit risk of 5.2 million, of which 210,000 was overdue, and an impairment charge of 105,000 was taken to the income statement in the year.
Cash deposits with financial institutions and derivative transactions are permitted with investment-grade financial institutions only.
The Company receives a small amount of income from properties which it has sublet to third parties, but the sums involved from any one letting are immaterial.
Liquidity risk The Company regularly monitors cash flow forecasts and endeavours to ensure that there are enough funds, including committed bank and finance lease facilities, to meet its business requirements and comply with banking covenants.
The risks in this area relate to miscalculating cash flow requirements, being unable to renew credit facilities or a substantial fall in sales and profits.
