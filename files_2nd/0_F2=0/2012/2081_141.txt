The Board is conscious that, just as it must set remuneration levels to attract and retain talented executives, it must also ensure that remuneration rates for Non-executive Directors are set at a level that will attract and retain the calibre of Director necessary to contribute effectively to a high-performing Board.
The remuneration levels reflect the size and complexity of the Group, the multi-jurisdictional environment arising from the Dual Listed Company structure, the multiple stock exchange listings, the extent of the geographic regions in which the Group operates and the enhanced responsibilities associated with membership of Board Committees.
They also reflect the considerable travel burden imposed on members of the Board.
In setting the remuneration of the Directors, the economic environment and the financial performance of the Group is taken into account, along with pay and employment conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group.
Fees for the Non-executive Directors are determined by the Chairman and the CEO.
The Non-executive Directors do not take part in these discussions.
Fees for the Chairman are determined by the Board on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.
Fees for the Non-executive Directors and Chairman were reviewed in June 2012 and benchmarked against peer companies with the assistance of externally provided benchmark data.
As a result of the review, a decision was taken to make no change to the fee levels of the Non-executive Directors or the Chairman for FY2013.
The table below sets out the fees that have been effective since 1 July 2008.
The aggregate sum available to remunerate Non-executive Directors was approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGMs at US$3.8 million.
