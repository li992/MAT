In 2012, 1.95Moz of gold were added Gold Reserves and Resources to the Groups Mineral Resource base before depletion based on the success of the Groups 2012 exploration programme.
Based on the success of the Groups 2012 exploration programme, in 2012 1.95Moz of gold were added to the Groups Mineral Resource base before depletion: a net increase of 0.45Moz to 25.1Moz after depletion and disposal of a non-core asset during the year.
Mineral Resources of 25.1Moz include 10.0Moz of Proven and Probable Reserves.
All added gold Resources are located within existing mining operations and c. 90% of the gold is contained in non-refractory ore, potentially suitable for processing through existing on-site RIP or heap-leach facilities.
The ore reserve grade of these recent discoveries was similar to the 2012 processing grade and considerably higher than the average for the Group Reserves.
The Groups Reserve grade was sustained in spite depletion of the higher grade ore during the year.
This Mineral Resource and Ore Reserves update is based as in the previous year, on a US$1,000 oz, long-term gold price, with the exception of Albyn and Visokoe, where current estimates use a gold price of US$1,200 oz.
The estimates were prepared following an extensive exploration programme, metallurgical tests and other technical work completed by the Group.
The estimates were made internally by the Groups specialist following the methodology advised by independent minerals specialists Wardell Armstrong International.
A summary of the Groups gold Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as of 1 January 2013 is shown below.

the Group holds a number of alluvial gold operations.
Due to the size of the individual operations and the nature of the mineralisation, the Group considers the preparation of JORC reports for the alluvials to be unpractical.
Therefore, the Group reports the alluvial resources and reserves following the Russian Classication System.
Total alluvial 3 gold reserves amount to c. 570,000oz at an average grade of 0.36g m whilst resources including Reserves are c. 1Moz at an average 3 grade of 0.37g m.
