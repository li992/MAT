Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES NIOBIUM estimates as at 31 December 2012 ANGLO AMERICAN NIBIO BRASIL LIMITADA The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
The gures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, the percentage attributable to Anglo American plc is stated separately.
Rounding of gures may cause computational discrepancies.

Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Boa Vista Oxide Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production.
2 Boa Vista Phosphate Tailings Ore Reserves: The fines portion of the Phosphate tailings from Ouvidor are processed in the Niobium Tailings Plant to recover Niobium.
3 Boa Vista Oxide Mineral Resources: The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The Mineral Resources are split into Oxide and Fresh Rock due to the recognition of distinct 2 5 differences in mineralogical characteristics.
The increase is due to improved grade control and new drilling information.
4 Catalo I & II Complex Fresh Rock Mineral Resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb O cut-off for Boa Vista Mine.
For Area Leste, Mina II and Morro do Padre the 2 5 cut-off grade is 0.7 %Nb O.
The increase is a result of the completion of a drilling campaign enabling the geological model to be updated along with a lowering in the cut-off grade.
Studies are in 2 5 progress to convert resources to reserves.
The Fresh Rock Resources are a combination of 4 project areas: Area Leste: Measured 8.2 Mt at 1.24 %Nb O : Indicated 4.7 Mt at 1.20 %Nb O : Inferred 1.3 Mt at 1.12 %Nb O 2 5 2 5 2 5 Boa Vista: Measured 0.6 Mt at 0.97 %Nb O : Indicated 28.6 Mt at 0.95 %Nb O : Inferred 9.2 Mt at 1.03 %Nb O 2 5 2 5 2 5 Mina II: Measured 5.5 Mt at 1.24 %Nb O : Indicated 0.9 Mt at 1.17 %Nb O : Inferred 0.8 Mt at 1.19 %Nb O 2 5 2 5 2 5 Morro do Padre: Indicated 2.6 Mt at 1.27 %Nb O : Inferred 8.9 Mt at 1.54 %Nb O 2 5 2 5 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2012 223
