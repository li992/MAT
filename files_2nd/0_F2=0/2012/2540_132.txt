Share-based payments The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2012, including national insurance of 0.4m 2011: 0.5m and dividend equivalents of 1.0m 2011: 0.4m, is 3.0m 2011: 4.7m.
This expense arises from transactions which are expected to be equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The Britvic Share Incentive Plan SIP The SIP is an all-employee plan approved by HMRC.
The plan allows for discretionary annual awards of free ordinary shares with a value of 3% of salary subject to HMRC maximum limits together with an offer of matching shares on the basis of one free matching share for each ordinary share purchased with a participants savings, up to a maximum of 50 2011: 75 per four week pay period.
Employees are entitled to receive the annual free share award, where granted by the group, provided they are employed by the company on the last day of each financial year and on the award date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Awards made during the period are shown in the table below.
The fair value of these awards is equivalent to the intrinsic value of the shares.
No of shares 2012 2011 Annual free shares award - 484,343 Matching shares award 1 free share for every ordinary share purchased 281,662 346,267 Britvic plc Annual Report 2012 87 financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Share-based payments continued The Britvic Executive Share Option Plan Option Plan The Option Plan allows for options to buy ordinary shares to be granted to selected employees.
The option price is the average market price of Britvic plcs shares on the three business days before the date of grant.
Options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance condition and remain exercisable until ten years after the date of grant.
The performance condition requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the average growth in RPI over the same period for the options to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% per annum in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2011: 25% of the options will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of options that vest and no options will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, an option holder who exercises his her option may receive a cash payment rather than the Ordinary shares under option.
The cash payment would be equal to the amount by which the market value of the ordinary shares under option exceeds the option price.
However, it is expected that this plan will be equity-settled and as a consequence has been accounted for as such.
The following table illustrates the movements in the number of share options during the period.
Number Weighted average of share exercise price options pence Outstanding as at 3 October 2010 7,548,083 283.7 Granted during the period 1,566,418 464.6 Exercised during the period 209,531 265.8 Forfeited during the period 140,584 392.4 Outstanding as at 2 October 2011 8,764,386 314.8 Granted during the period 2,175,767 331.6 Exercised during the period 244,499 233.1 Forfeited during the period 246,138 406.4 Lapsed during the period 9,496 347.0 Outstanding at 30 September 2012 10,440,020 318.0 Exercisable at 30 September 2012 4,659,273 258.1 The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 362.2p 2011: 459.3p.
The share options outstanding as at 30 September 2012 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.7 years 2011: 7.1 years and the range of exercise prices was 221.0p 464.6p 2011: 221.0p 464.6p.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period was 58.2p 2011: 82.8p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model, taking account of the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The following table lists the inputs to the model used in respect of the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2012.

Share-based payments continued The Britvic Performance Share Plan PSP The PSP allows for awards of ordinary shares or nil cost options to be made to selected employees with vesting subject to the satisfaction of a performance condition.
Different performance conditions apply to different groups of employees.
Awards up to and including 2008 were made in respect of ordinary shares.
Awards granted in 2009 and 2010 were made in respect of nil cost options.
Nil cost options become exercisable on the satisfaction of the performance conditions and remain exercisable until 10 years 7 years after the date of grant for employees based in the UK Ireland respectively.
The performance condition applying to the total number of awards granted to members of the senior leadership team during the current period is divided equally between the total shareholder return TSR and return on invested capital ROIC performance conditions described below.
The TSR condition measures the companys TSR relative to a comparator group consisting of 18 companies over a three year performance period.
The awards will not vest unless the companys position in the comparator group is at least median.
At median 25% 2011: 25% will vest, rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting at upper quartile.
For the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 30 September 2012, the ROIC performance condition requires the companys ROIC to be at least 22.3% 2011: for the award granted during the 52 weeks ended 2 October 2011, 22.7% over the three year performance period for the award to vest in full.
If ROIC is 21.5% 2011: 21.9% over the performance period, 25% 2011: 25% of the award will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the percentage of awards that vest and no awards will vest if ROIC is below the lower threshold.
Awards granted to members of the senior management team vest solely subject to a performance condition which requires average growth in EPS of 7% pa over a three year period in excess of the growth in RPI over the same period for the awards to vest in full.
If EPS growth averages 3% pa in excess of RPI growth, 25% 2011: 25% of the awards will vest.
Straight-line apportionment will be applied between these two levels to determine the number of awards that vest and no awards will vest if average EPS growth is below the lower threshold.
In some circumstances, at the discretion of the company, vested awards may be satisfied by a cash payment rather than a transfer of ordinary shares.
The following tables illustrate the movements in the number of shares and nil cost options during the period.

The nil cost options outstanding as at 30 September 2012 had a weighted average remaining contracted life of 8.2 years TSR condition 2011: 8.5 years, 8.0 years EPS condition 2011: 8.4 years and 8.2 years ROIC condition 2011: 8.5 years.
The weighted average fair value of nil cost options granted during the period was 194.2p TSR condition 2011: 258.6p, 323.0p EPS condition 2011: 413.0p and 322.7p ROIC condition 2011: 413.0p.
