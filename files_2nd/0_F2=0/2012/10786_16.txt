Amortisation of intangible assets is split equally between cost of sales and administration costs and is disclosed in note 5.
The amortisation periods for intangible assets are: Years Software 5 Customer Database 5 The brand names arising from the acquisition of Gray & Osbourn Limited, High and Mighty and Slimma and Figleaves are deemed to have indefinite lives as there are no foreseeable limits to the periods over which they are expected to generate cash inflows and are subject to annual impairment tests.
The carrying value of the brand names have been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for this calculation are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and the forecast cash flows.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent three year financial budgets approved by management and thereafter extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity with 2.7% growth assumed to reflect that there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which cash flows are expected to be generated.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 5.7% 2011, 6.3%.

The average credit period given to customers for the sale of goods is 243 days 2011, 241 days.
Interest is charged at 39.9% 2011, 39.9% on the outstanding balance.
Generally, receivables over 150 days past due are written off in full.
Trade receivables that reach the trigger point of 56 days past due are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts, determined by reference to past default experience.
The carrying amount of trade receivables whose terms have been renegotiated but would otherwise be past due totalled 66.5m at 3 March 2012 2011, 59.9m.
Before accepting any new customer, the group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and scores attributed to customers are reviewed every 28 days.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired, with regard to the historical default rate has remained stable.

Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

ii The group has a bank loan of 220m 2011, 190m secured by a charge over certain eligible trade debtors current and 0-28 days past due of the group and is without recourse to any of the groups other assets.
The facility has a current limit of 250m and finance costs are linked to US commercial paper rates and is committed until March 2016.
In addition the group has unsecured bank loans of 30m 2011, 40m drawn down under a medium term bank revolving credit facility, which was renegotiated in November 2011, of 100 million committed until March 2016. iii All borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The group use derivatives such as interest rate swaps where appropriate.
Based on weighted average interest rates and the value of bank loans at 3 March 2012 the estimated future interest cost per annum until maturity would be 2.1m 2011, 1.6m.
Financial liabilities other than financial instruments include bank loans and overdrafts and trade and other payables.
Other than as disclosed above, all are due within one year.
The maturity analysis of the groups financial liability on an undiscounted basis, assuming that the facilities are retained until the end of the committed period are as follows: 2012 2011 m m On demand or within one year 2.1 41.6 In the second year 2.1 191.3 In the third to fourth year 2.1 In the fifth year 252.1 258.4 232.9 At 3 March 2012, the group had available 120m 2011, 90m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The Financial Review on page 15 summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
There is no material difference between the fair value and book value of the groups borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities.

The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are all grouped into Level 2 2011, same.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year 2011, same.
19 Financial instruments Capital risk management The group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 17, cash and cash equivalents disclosed in note 24 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 22 to 23 and the statement of changes in equity.
Gearing ratio The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2012 2011 m m Debt 250.0 230.0 Cash and cash equivalents 57.5 49.1 Net Debt 192.5 180.9 Equity 402.3 360.4 Gearing ratio 48% 50% Debt is defined as long and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 17.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the group attributable to equity holders of the parent.
Externally imposed capital requirement The group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2.
Financial risk management objectives The financial risks facing the group include currency risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The group seeks to minimise the effects of certain of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures as governed by the groups policies.
The group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency risk management The group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is the policy of the group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover specific foreign currency payments for the purchase of overseas sourced products.
Group policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to three years ahead.

The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors assessment of a reasonably possible change.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.

Where appropriate, exposure to interest rate fluctuations on indebtedness is managed by using derivatives such as interest rate swaps.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis If interest rates had increased by 0.5% and all other variables were held constant, the groups profit before tax for the 53 weeks ended 3 March 2012 would decrease by 1.25m 2011, 1.1m.
This sensitivity analysis has been determined based on exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date and assuming the net debt outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative financial instruments are made through banks which are approved by the board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, supplied by independent rating agencies.
Customer debtor balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated, and did not exceed five percent of gross monetary assets at any one time during the period.
Liquidity risk management The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking and borrowing facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 17 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the group has at its disposal and details of the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
Fair value of financial instruments Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate their fair values.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of 2.2m and 2.1m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2012 and 2011 respectively.
64 N Brown Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Notes to the Group Accounts 28 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 2.0m 2011, 1.8m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 3 March 2012, contributions of 0.2m 2011, 0.2m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 June 2009 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2012 2011 Discount rate 4.8% 5.6% Expected return on scheme assets 4.6% 5.7% Expected rate of salary increase 4.4% 4.8% Future pension increases 2.4% 2.4% Inflation Retail Price Index 3.4% 3.8% Inflation Consumer Price Index 2.4% 2.8% Life expectancy at age 65 years Pensioner aged 65 23.8 23.8 Non-pensioner aged 45 26.8 26.8 2012 2011 Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: m m Current service cost 1.8 1.6 Interest cost 3.9 3.9 Expected return on scheme assets 4.2 3.9 Gains on settlements 2.9 1.5 1.3 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
The cumulative actuarial losses since transition to IFRS were 0.1m 2011, actuarial gains of 6.1m.
The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of 8.4m 2011, gain of 7.3m.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.
