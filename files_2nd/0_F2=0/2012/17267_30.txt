Wolseley plc 102 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Year ended 31 July 2012 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union, including interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees.
The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and is headquartered in Switzerland.
Accounting developments and changes There have been no changes to Group accounting policies during the year ended 31 July 2012.
A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out in note 37 on pages 137 to 143.
There are no IFRSs or IFRIC interpretation that are effective for the first time for the financial year beginning on or after 1 August 2012 that are expected to have a material impact on the Group.
An amended standard on employee benefits, IAS 19, which will be mandatory for the Group for the financial year beginning 1 August 2013, requires the net funding cost of retirement benefits obligations to be calculated using the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation.
If the Group had adopted this amended standard in the year ended 31 July 2012 its financing costs would have been increased by approximately 10 million.
There are no other new standards, amendments to and interpretations of existing standards that have been published that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.
Choices permitted by IFRS The Group has elected to apply hedge accounting to some of its financial instruments, and to recognise its liability for retirement benefit obligations in full.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Many of the Groups accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.
The following areas are most sensitive to the accuracy of such estimates.
Impairment of trade receivables A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made when management estimates that the expected present value of future cash flows recoverable in respect of these receivables is less than the carrying amount.
Determining the amount of such provision requires estimating the amount and timing of such future cash flows, giving consideration to the financial condition of the debtor and the probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
The actual amounts of cash recovered may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision is based.
The amount relating to continuing operations charged to the income statement in 2012 in respect of impaired receivables represented 0.25 per cent of revenue 2011: 0.35 per cent.
Wolseley held a provision for impairment of receivables at 31 July 2012 amounting to 46 million 2011: 47 million.
Valuation of inventories Provisions are made against slow-moving, obsolete and damaged inventories for which the net realisable value is estimated to be less than the cost.
Inventories which are damaged or obsolete are written down as identified.
The risk of obsolescence of slow-moving inventory is assessed by comparing the level of inventory held to future sales projected on the basis of historical experience.
The actual realisable value of inventory may differ materially from the estimated value on which the provision is based.
The Group held allowances in respect of inventory balances at 31 July 2012 amounting to 116 million 2011: 126 million.
Overview Performance Governance Financials Information Wolseley plc 103 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Impairment of assets The Group reviews assets that have an indefinite useful life at least annually to assess whether their recoverable amount exceeds their carrying value.
The recoverable amount is defined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use, which in turn is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
The recoverable amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets is assessed on the basis of the value in use of the cash generating unit or group of cash generating units CGU to which they are attributed.
The estimate of value in use, and hence the outcome of the impairment test, is sensitive to the assumptions made about the revenue growth, trading margin and the level of working capital required to support trading over the next five years, the long-term growth rate of their market, and the discount rate considered appropriate to reflect the time value of money and any risks specific to the CGU that are not reflected in the cash flows.
As disclosed in notes 12 and 13, the Group has charged 353 million in respect of the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles assets at 31 July 2012 2011: 42 million after preparing value in use calculations on the basis of assumptions set out on page 140.
A 220 million impairment has been incurred in the Nordic region and a 133 million impairment has been incurred in France.
Following this impairment charge the Groups two Danish businesses, Stark and Silvan, have goodwill and acquired intangible assets with a carrying value at 31 July 2012 of 142 million and 32 million respectively.
There are no goodwill and acquired intangible assets remaining in France at 31 July 2012.
If the long-term prospects for the Danish market or the competitive positions of Stark and Silvan are weaker than assumed in calculating their underlying value in use, then further impairment charges may be required against the carrying value of these assets.
The estimated value in use of these businesses is most sensitive to the trading profit assumed in the final year of the cash flow forecast which reflects the latest estimate of the mid point in the business cycle.
A reduction in trading profit of approximately 5 per cent would result in a further impairment of 25 million.
Rebates receivable from vendors The Group enters into agreements with many of its vendors that provide for rebates of the cost of inventory purchased.
Many of these agreements apply to purchases in a calendar rather than financial year, and under certain agreements the rebate rises as a proportion of purchases as higher quantities or values of purchases are made.
The Group adjusts the cost of inventory purchased to reflect estimated rebates receivable, which can depend on the projected volume, value and mix of purchases from a vendor through to the end of the qualifying period.
Actual rebates receivable from vendors may differ materially from the estimates on which the cost of inventory is based.
Provisions for self-insured risks The Group retains layers of certain of its insurable risks, principally US casualty and global property damage, which are managed by a captive insurance company, Wolseley Insurance Limited.
Certain of the retained risks are subject to an annual actuarial assessment.
The provision for self-insured risks represents an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported.
The actual cost of settling these liabilities may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provision is based.
At 31 July 2012, the provision for claims arising from this insurance was 46 million 2011: 57 million.
Wolseley plc 104 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2012 1.
Accounting policies and critical estimates and judgements continued Provisions for legal, environmental and related exposures and contingent liabilities The Group makes provisions for known and potential legal claims and environmental and other matters, including asbestos related litigation and product liability claims, where an outflow of resources is considered probable and a reliable estimate may be made of the likely outcome of the dispute or matter.
In establishing such provisions the Group takes into account the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and considers the advice of its legal and other professional advisers.
The ultimate liability for potential legal claims and other matters may be dependent upon the discovery of facts that are currently uncertain, the outcome of litigation proceedings and possible settlement negotiations, and the actual cost of settlement may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2012 legal, environmental and other provisions amounted to 149 million 2011: 164 million.
Where the Group has insurance cover that it is virtually certain will settle a provision then it recognises an equivalent asset in trade and other receivables.
The Group may also become involved in legal proceedings or commercial disputes in respect of which it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings or disputes.
In these cases, where material, appropriate disclosure would be included in the financial statements but no provision would be made and no contingent liability can be quantified.
Provisions for onerous leases When the present value of the future cash flows receivable from the operation of leased assets is less than the present value of the rental payments to which the Group is committed, the Group applies the shortfall firstly against the carrying amount of the assets in the case of finance leases and then provides for any further onerous element of the contract for all leases.
Determining the amount of such a provision requires estimating the future net cash flows receivable in respect of these assets, and in the particular case where the leased properties are vacant this requires assessing the likely period for which the property will remain vacant, the cost of any works required to enhance its marketability and the rental income receivable when the property is sublet.
Actual cash flows paid and received may differ materially from the estimated amounts on which the provisions are based.
At 31 July 2012, the provision for onerous leases was 39 million 2011: 54 million.
Taxation Accruals for current tax are based on managements interpretation of country-specific tax law, and require judgements about the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained.
Where management considers it probable that the tax position will be sustained, each material tax benefit is reviewed to assess whether it should be recognised in full, or whether provision should be made for a potential settlement through negotiation.
All such provisions are included in current liabilities.
Any estimated exposure to interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom and in a number of overseas locations that are accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates, and are disclosed in note 25.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most sensitive assumptions are the discount rate and life expectancy.
The Group has estimated that a decrease of 0.5 per cent in the discount rate would increase the liability by 141 million, an increase of 0.5 per cent would decrease the liability by 125 million.
Increasing the estimate of life expectancy by one year would increase the liability by 36 million.

Non-GAAP performance measures Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
As explained on page 150, the Group considers that trading profit, and other performance measures based on it, including EBITDA before exceptional items, present valuable additional information to users of the financial statements.

The carrying value of the remaining goodwill and other acquired intangible assets relating to Stark, Silvan and Neumann was 142 million, 32 million and 27 million respectively at 31 July 2012.
Market conditions have also been more challenging than expected in France and the outlook has become increasingly uncertain.
As a result, expectations of profitability for PBM have been reduced resulting in the impairment of all its goodwill and acquired intangible assets.
Pre-tax discount rates of between 1112 per cent 2011: 1012 per cent and long-term growth rates of between 1.5-2.0 per cent have been used in the value in use models for the Nordic and France segments.

There are other potential deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling 23 million 2011: 15 million that have not been recognised on the basis that their future economic benefit is uncertain.
The losses are in the UK, relating to capital disposals, and Sweden and do not expire.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
However, tax may arise on 176 million 2011: 379 million of temporary differences but the Group is in a position to control the timing of their reversal and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

At 30 November 2011 the notes were stated at an amount of 551 million, comprising a par value of 474 million and a fair value adjustment of 77 million, which was offset by the carrying value of interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of 79 million 2011: 513 million, 453 million, 60 million and 64 million respectively.
During November 2011 the Group entered into a series of receive floating, pay fixed interest rate swaps over the remaining duration of the notes, such that the Group is now effectively paying a weighted average fixed interest rate of 2.5 per cent on the par value of the notes.
This transaction is not eligible for hedge accounting, and accordingly the Group has fide-designated the hedge relationship.
The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the notes is being released to the income statement on an amortised cost basis over the period to maturity of the notes.
At 31 July 2012 the carrying amount of the notes of 542 million comprised a par value of 475 million and a fair value adjustment of 67 million.

Financial instruments and financial risk management There have been no significant changes during the year to the Groups policies on accounting for, valuing and managing the risk of financial instruments.
These policies are summarised on pages 142 to 149.
Capital structure To assess the appropriateness of its capital structure to current and forecast trading, the Groups principal measure of financial gearing is the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items.
The Group aims to operate with investment grade credit metrics and ensure this ratio does not exceed 1 to 2 times.
The Groups main borrowing facilities contain a financial covenant limiting the ratio of net debt to EBITDA before exceptional items to 3.5:1.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.

The environmental and legal provision includes 52 million 2011: 44 million for the estimated liability for asbestos litigation on a discounted basis using a long-term discount rate of 2.2 per cent 2011: 3.8 per cent.
This amount has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2012 based on advice from independent professional advisers.
The Group has insurance that it currently believes is sufficient to cover the estimated liability and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in other receivables.
Based on current estimates, the amount of performing insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no material profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.
There were 155 claims outstanding at 31 July 2012 31 July 2011: 160.
Restructuring provisions include provisions for staff redundancy costs and future lease rentals on closed branches.
In determining the provision for onerous leases, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately five years.
Other provisions include the Groups best estimate of the cost of potential product and service warranty claims arising in Stock Building Supply before its disposal on 6 May 2009, and other warranty and separation costs relating to businesses disposed.
Other provisions also include rental commitments on vacant properties other than those arising from restructuring actions, dilapidations on leased properties and warranties.
The weighted average maturity of these obligations is approximately three years.

Retirement benefit obligations i Long-term benefit plans provided by the Group The Group has a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its UK employees.
The Group operates a number of smaller schemes in other jurisdictions, providing pensions or other long-term benefits such as long service or termination awards.
More information about the schemes operated by the Group is set out on pages 150 and 151.
There have been no significant changes during the financial year.
The Group currently expects to contribute 44 million to the UK defined benefit schemes and 12 million to the non-UK defined benefit schemes in the year ending 31 July 2013.
All of the Groups companies are now reviewing their pension arrangements and this may lead to further cash contributions in the range of 100 million to 150 million.

The expected equity returns can be considered as a risk free rate of return determined by reference to government bond rates in the countries in which the plans are based plus a risk premium to reflect the additional risks associated with equities.
For the UK scheme the expected return implies a premium of 3.9 per cent per year as at 31 July 2012 2011: 3.1 per cent over the expected return from government bonds.
For the principal overseas schemes in the USA, Canada and Switzerland a similar approach has been adopted with returns set by reference to long-term bond rates after taking actuarial advice.

Under the Ordinary Share Plan, employees can be granted a variable number of awards in any form or combination of options, restricted share awards, conditional share awards or phantom share awards up to a maximum of 100 per cent of their current salary.
The vesting period is three years and there are no performance measures other than retained employment.
The first awards were granted on 15 November 2011.
There have been no other significant changes to the Groups share-based payment plans, which are summarised on page 152.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Schemes are subject to a condition such that they may not be exercised unless the growth in headline earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period by at least 9 per cent.
When management expect that there is no realistic probability that this condition for a particular award to vest will be attained, amounts charged in previous periods in respect of that award are credited to the income statement.
No such credit has been recorded in 2012.
In 2011 13 million was credited to the income statement in respect of the 2008 award.
The number of outstanding and number of exercisable share options and share awards are detailed below.

Some of these operating lease arrangements have renewal options and rental escalation clauses, though the effect of these is not material.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The commitments shown above include commitments for onerous leases which have already been provided for.
At 31 July 2012 provisions include an amount of 39 million 2011: 54 million in respect of minimum lease payments for such onerous leases net of sublease payments expected to be received.
The total minimum sublease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable subleases at 31 July 2012 is 36 million 2011: 19 million.
Contingent liabilities Group companies are, from time to time, subject to certain claims and litigation arising in the normal course of business in relation to, among other things, the suitability of products, contract and commercial disputes and disputes with employees.
Provision is made if, on the basis of current information and professional advice, liabilities are considered likely to arise.
In the case of unfavourable outcomes the Group may benefit from applicable insurance recoveries.
Certain claims arise as a result of the unintentional supply of defective products and these claims are usually the responsibility of the manufacturer, though defence and other costs may also be incurred by the Group.
Mislabelled gaskets In December 2011 the Groups US business wrote to a number of customers in the USA and Canada in relation to the unintentional supply of gaskets which were mislabelled by a former supplier, Lortech Rubber Inc. of Canada, as being nonasbestos.
A number of customers had found asbestos in gaskets above the level at which they can be classified as nonasbestos.
Independent expert advice confirmed that there was no health or safety risk arising from the handling, installation and use of the gaskets.
Well-established protocols are maintained by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration to ensure the safe removal of all types of gaskets.
The performance of the gaskets is not affected and the expert advice is to leave the gaskets in place until the end of their lives.
The supply of these products in the USA and Canada is legal.
No significant product liability claims have arisen from this matter to date.
Warranties and guarantees in relation to business disposals Following a review of the appropriate allocation of the Groups resources in 2009 the Group has disposed of a number of non-core businesses and various Group companies have provided certain standard warranties and guarantees to acquirers and other third parties, including warranties regarding financial statements and taxation.
Provision is made where the Group considers that a liability is likely to crystallise, though it is possible that claims in respect of which no provisions has been made could be received in the future.
Group companies have also guaranteed certain property and other obligations which could be called in an event of default.
As at the date of this report there are no significant outstanding claims in relation to business disposals.
Outcome The outcome of claims and litigation to which Group companies are party cannot readily be foreseen as, in some cases, the facts are unclear, further time is needed to properly assess the merits of the case, or they are part of continuing legal proceedings.
However, based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
Post balance sheet events On 21 August 2012, the Group completed the disposal of the Woodcote Group for proceeds of 3.4 million.
On 25 September 2012, the Group completed the acquisition of Power Equipment Direct, an online retailer of generators and power equipment, for a maximum consideration of 41 million.
It had revenue of 53 million in its last financial year.

Additional information Group accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies applied by the Group in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements is set out below.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
These exclude impairments of acquired intangibles which are also presented separately in the income statement.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include restructurings of business activities and gains or losses on the disposal of businesses.
Consolidation The consolidated financial information includes the results of the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2012.
The trading results of businesses other than discontinued operations acquired or sold during the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from continuing operations from the date of acquisition or up to the date of sale.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Discontinued operations When the Group has disposed of or intends to dispose of a business component that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations it classifies such operations as discontinued.
The post-tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations is shown as a single line on the face of the income statement, separate from the other results of the Group.
Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary undertaking operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group and the functional currency of the parent company.
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the period end.
Exchange differences arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the year are recognised in the currency translation reserve as are exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets.
Changes in the fair value and the final settlement value of derivative financial instruments, entered into to hedge foreign currency net assets and that satisfy the hedging conditions of IAS 39, are recognised in the currency translation reserve see the separate accounting policy on derivative financial instruments.
In the event that an overseas subsidiary undertaking is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Foreign currency transactions entered into during the year are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All currency translation differences are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign currency net assets as detailed above.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Business combinations The introduction of a new holding company in 2011 constituted a group reconstruction and was accounted for using merger accounting principles.
In all other cases the Group has applied the purchase method in its accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
Acquisition related costs are expensed.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services falling within the Groups ordinary activities, excluding intra-group sales, estimated and actual sales returns, trade and early settlement discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Revenue from the provision of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of goods have been transferred to the customer.
The risks and rewards of ownership of goods are deemed to have been transferred when the goods are shipped to, or are picked up, by the customer.
Revenue from services is recognised when the service provided to the customer has been completed.
Customer loyalty credits are accounted for as a separate component of the sales transaction in which they are granted.
A portion of the fair value of the consideration received is allocated to the loyalty credits and recognised over the period that loyalty credits are redeemed.
Revenue from the provision of goods and services is only recognised when the amounts to be recognised are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.
Cost of sales Cost of sales includes purchased goods, the cost of bringing inventory to its present location and condition, and labour and overheads attributable to assembly and construction services.
Vendor rebates The Group enters into arrangements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates.
These purchase rebates are accrued as earned and are recorded initially as a reduction in inventory with a subsequent reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary undertaking at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
All goodwill has arisen from business combinations.
On transition to IFRS, the balance of goodwill as measured under UK GAAP was allocated to cash-generating units and groups of cash-generating units CGUs.
These are independent sources of income streams, and represent the lowest level within the Group at which the associated goodwill is monitored for management purposes, which may be at country, divisional, brand or regional level.
Goodwill arising on business combinations after 1 August 2004 has been allocated to the CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
No CGUs are larger than the reporting segments determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Other intangible assets An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably.
The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets, primarily brands, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Amortisation is calculated using the reducing balance method for customer relationships and the straight-line method for other intangible assets.
The cost of the intangible assets is amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 4 25 years Trade names and brands 1 15 years Other 1 4 years Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset and is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include software licences, consulting costs attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software and internal costs directly attributable to the development, design and implementation of the computer software.
Costs in respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method so as to charge the cost of the computer software to the income statement over its estimated useful life as follows: Software 3 5 years Software assets are generally either purchases from third parties or internally generated.
Other intangible assets arise on business combinations.
Property, plant and equipment PPE PPE is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, except for land and assets in the course of construction, which are not depreciated and are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
In addition, subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings and long leaseholds 35 50 years Operating leasehold improvements over the period of the lease Plant and machinery 7 10 years Computer hardware 3 5 years Fixtures and fittings 5 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years The residual values and useful lives of PPE are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the long-term construction or production of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have transferred to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.
The asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The capital elements of future obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities in the balance sheet and analysed between current and non-current amounts.
The interest elements of future obligations under finance leases are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
The cost of operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the periods of the leases.
Wolseley plc 140 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2012 37.
Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Assets and disposal groups held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered by sale rather than by continuing use in the business.
Where a group of assets and their directly associated liabilities are to be disposed of in a single transaction, such disposal groups are also classified as held for sale.
For this to be the case, the asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition, and management must be committed to and have initiated a plan to sell the asset or disposal group which, when initiated, was expected to result in a completed sale within 12 months.
Assets that are classified as held for sale are not depreciated.
Assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, such as goodwill, are not subject to amortisation or depreciation and are tested annually for impairment and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation and assets under construction are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
The value in use is in most cases based on the discounted present value of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or from the individual asset or asset group.
The value in use calculations in respect of CGUs use cash flow projections based on five year financial forecasts approved by management.
The key assumptions for these forecasts are those regarding revenue growth, trading margin and the level of working capital required to support trading, which management estimates based on past experience, reflecting the cyclicality of earnings, and expectations of future changes in the market.
To prepare value in use calculations, the cash flow forecasts are extrapolated after the five year period at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate for each market ranging from 1.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent, and discounted back to present value.
The discount rate assumptions use an estimate of the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 8.3 per cent, based on the five year historic volatility of Wolseley shares and on benchmark interest rates.
The pre-tax discount rate which ranges from 11 per cent to 14 per cent 2011: 10 per cent to 13 per cent has been applied to the risk adjusted cash flows of each CGU.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and acquired intangibles for CGUs which have a significant proportion of the Groups total are: Blended Branches USA 243 million, Beijer Nordic 152 million, Stark Nordic 142 million, Waterworks USA 105 million and Starkki Nordic 97 million.
Inventories Inventories, which all comprise goods purchased for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out FIFO method or the average cost method as appropriate to the nature of the transactions in those items of inventory.
The cost of goods purchased for resale includes import and custom duties, transport and handling costs, freight and packing costs and other attributable costs less trade discounts, rebates and other subsidies.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Examples of such evidence include significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are written off against the provision when recoverability is assessed as being remote.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Provisions Provisions for environmental restoration, restructuring costs, product and service warranties and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Such provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
The discount rate used to determine the present value reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions for insurance represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date on certain risks retained by the Group.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Retirement benefit obligations Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post-retirement benefits are charged to the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension plans and other retirement benefits, the cost is calculated annually using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
The current service cost of defined benefit plans is recorded within operating profit.
The total expected return from pension scheme assets less the total interest on pension scheme liabilities is recorded within finance revenue if a gain and finance costs if an expense.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recorded within operating profit and recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation at the balance sheet date, less any past service costs not yet recognised, less the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
Taxation Current tax represents the expected tax payable or recoverable on the taxable income for the year using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and taking into account any adjustments arising from prior years.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds, net of tax.
Where any group company purchases the Companys equity share capital treasury shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Wolseley plc 142 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2012 37.
Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued Share-based payments Share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups executive share option, long-term incentive, employee share purchase and ordinary share plan schemes.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards, measured using Black-Scholes, Binomial and Monte Carlo valuation methodologies.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant including the impact of any non-vesting conditions such as a requirement for employees to save and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
For cash-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is re-measured at each balance sheet date until the liability is settled.
The fair value at the date of grant of options awarded during the year has been estimated by the binomial methodology for all schemes except the long term incentive scheme, for which a Monte Carlo simulation was used.
The fair value of shares granted under the Ordinary Share Plan and Restricted Share Plan was calculated as the market price of the shares at the date of grant reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid over the vesting period.
The principal assumptions required by these methodologies were: Long Term Incentive Executive Share Options Employee Share Options Schemes 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Risk free interest rate 1.4% 2.55% 0.65% 1.57% 1.4% 1.31% Expected dividend yield 3.8% 1.84% 3.22% 1.80% 3.8% 1.93% Expected volatility 44.51% 42.14% 43.73% 44.04% 41% 53.2% Expected life 5.7 years 5.7 years 17 years 17 years 3 years 3 years Expected volatility has been estimated on the basis of historic volatility over the expected term, excluding the effect of extraordinary volatility due to the Groups capital reorganisation and rights issue in 2009.
Expected life has been estimated on the basis of historical data on the exercise pattern.
The principal assumptions for the Ordinary Share Plan are expected dividend yield of 3.8 per cent and expected life of three years.
Generally, the compensation cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to the failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
Dividends payable Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the shareholders of the Company generally in the case of the final dividend or paid in the case of interim dividends.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet to the extent that there is no right of offset and no practice of net settlement with cash balances.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, in particular interest rate swaps and currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in derivative financial instruments.
At the inception of a hedging transaction entailing the use of derivative financial instruments, the Group documents the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument together with its risk management objective and the strategy underlying the proposed transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception of the hedging relationship and subsequently on an ongoing basis, of the effectiveness of the hedge in offsetting movements in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Where derivative financial instruments do not fulfil the criteria for hedge accounting contained in IAS 39, changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement.

Additional information continued Group accounting policies continued When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability is adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument arising from the hedged risk are recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity are either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, are recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration received net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost with any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Fair value measurements can be classified in the following hierarchy: Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 : Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 : Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market such as over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves.
The fair value of currency swaps has been estimated as the cost of closing out the contracts using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The Groups other financial instruments are measured on bases other than fair value.
Other receivables include an amount of 52 million 2011: 44 million which has been discounted at a rate of 2.2 per cent 2011: 3.8 per cent due to the long-term nature of the receivable.
Because other current assets and liabilities are either of short maturity or bear floating rate interest, their fair values approximate to book values.
The book values and fair values of categories including non-current assets and liabilities can be compared as follows: 2012 2012 2011 2011 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Trade and other receivables, excluding prepayments and accrued income 1,840 1,840 1,846 1,846 Trade and other payables, excluding accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security 1,931 1,931 1,950 1,950 Bank loans 245 245 352 352 Senior unsecured notes 542 567 513 513 Finance lease obligations 53 53 52 52 Financial instruments: risk management policies The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international operations, and the financial instruments which fund them.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of interest rate, liquidity, foreign exchange and counterparty exposures, which have been consistently applied during the financial years ended 31 July 2011 and 31 July 2012.
By the nature of its business the Group also has trade credit and commodity price exposures, the management of which is delegated to operating businesses.
There has been no change since the year end in the major financial risks faced by the Group.
Policies for managing each of these risks are regularly reviewed and are summarised below.
When the Group enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be undertaken.
Wolseley plc 146 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Year ended 31 July 2012 37.
Additional information continued Additional information about financial instruments continued Capital risk management The Groups sources of funding currently comprise cash flows generated by operations, equity contributed by shareholders and borrowings from banks and other financial institutions.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may pay a special dividend, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains a policy of ensuring sufficient borrowing headroom to finance all investment and capital expenditure included in its strategic plan, with an additional contingent safety margin.
The Group has estimated its anticipated contractual cash outflows including interest payable in respect of its trade and other payables and bank borrowings on an undiscounted basis.
The principal assumptions are that floating rate interest is calculated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date, and cash flows in foreign currency are translated using spot rates at the balance sheet date.
These cash flows can be analysed by maturity as follows: Trade and other Interest on debt payables Debt Total As at 31 July 2012 m m m m Due in less than one year 1,855 92 29 1,976 Due in one to two years 7 1 28 36 Due in two to three years 5 40 28 73 Due in three to four years 5 200 23 228 Due in four to five years 5 7 19 31 Due in over five years 54 380 52 486 Total 1,931 720 179 2,830 Trade and Interest rate other Interest on and currency payables Debt debt swaps Total As at 31 July 2011 m m m m m Due in less than one year 1,876 197 31 2 2,106 Due in one to two years 15 50 29 94 Due in two to three years 5 9 28 42 Due in three to four years 5 36 28 69 Due in four to five years 4 198 23 225 Due in over five years 45 386 68 499 Total 1,950 876 207 2 3,035 Ov Over ervie view w P Per erfformance ormance Go Gov vernance ernance Financials Financials Inf Infor ormat mation ion Wolseley plc 147 Annual Report and Accounts 2012 37.
Additional information continued Additional information about financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are located.
Approximately 46 per cent of the Groups revenue is in US dollars and 19 per cent in Euros.
The Group does not have significant transactional foreign currency cash flow exposures.
However, those that do arise may be hedged with either forward contracts or currency options.
The Group does not normally hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary effect.
The Groups policy is to adjust the currencies in which its debt is denominated to materially match the currencies in which its trading profit is generated.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group, are shown in the Five year summary on page 160.
The net effect of currency translation was to reduce revenue by 47 million 0.3 per cent 2011: decrease of 70 million, or 0.5 per cent and to have no impact on trading profit 2011: decrease of 1 million, or 0.2 per cent.
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange rate against US dollars, Euros and Canadian dollars as follows: 2012 2011 Strengthening Strengthening weakening weakening of sterling of sterling US dollars 1.2% 1.7% Euros 2.8% 1.8% Canadian dollars 0.3% 3.6% The Group has financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies which have been designated as hedges of the net investment in its overseas subsidiaries.
The principal value of these financial instruments at the balance sheet date was 452 million 2011: 852 million.
The gain on translation of these financial instruments into sterling of 7 million 2011: gain of 12 million has been taken to the translation reserve.
At 31 July 2012 the Group had the following short-term currency swaps and forward contracts which were designated and effective as hedges of overseas operations.

Additional information continued Additional information about financial instruments continued The Group also has used forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge cash flows in respect of committed transactions and has classified these contracts as fair value through profit or loss.
At 31 July 2012 there were no open contracts so classified.
At 31 July 2011 the Group had entered into the following short-term forward contracts so classified: 2011 Currency million m Bought sold forward DKK 1,360 160 SEK 1,415 137 EUR 25 22 USD 1 1 Interest rate risk To manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Groups policy is normally that between 0 per cent and 50 per cent of projected borrowings required during the next two years should be at fixed rates.
However, this percentage is regularly reviewed by the Board and 72 per cent of loans were at fixed rates at 31 July 2012.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies principally at rates determined by reference to short-term benchmark rates applicable to the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR.
Rates which reset at least every 12 months are regarded as floating rates, and the Group then uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile.
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at Treasury Committee and Board meetings.
The Treasury Committee gives prior approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
Interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on notional principal of 100 million were held at fair value through profit and loss at 31 July 2011 and expired on 13 August 2011.
These swap contracts were designated as cash flow hedges until 31 January 2010.
As the cash flows which were the subject of the hedge relationship were still forecast to occur, valuation losses deferred in equity were recycled over the duration of the previous hedge relationship.
During November 2011 the Group entered into interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest payable on $664 million of notional principal.
The contracts expire between November 2015 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 1.51 per cent and 2.94 per cent.
These contracts have been held since inception at fair value through profit or loss.
With effect from 1 December 2011 interest rate swap contracts comprising fixed interest receivable on notional principal of $729 million have been classified as held at fair value through profit or loss.
The contracts expire between November 2012 and November 2020 and the fixed interest rates range between 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent 2011: 4.93 per cent and 5.32 per cent.

The movement in fair value of these interest rate swaps between 1 August 2011 and 30 November 2011 was analysed into a proportion that was effective as a hedge, and a proportion that was ineffective: both portions were charged to the income statement with the effective portion offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged borrowings see note 5.

There is an associated risk that customers may not be able to pay outstanding loan balances.
At 31 July 2012 the maximum exposure to credit risk was 1,846 million 2011: 1,872 million of which 6 million 2011: 33 million is secured against properties under construction or completed properties awaiting sale.
Each of the businesses have established procedures in place to review and collect outstanding receivables.
Significant outstanding and overdue balances are reviewed on a regular basis and resulting actions are put in place on a timely basis.
In some cases protection is provided through credit insurance arrangements.
All of the major businesses use professional, dedicated credit teams, in some cases field-based.
Appropriate provisions are made for debts that may be impaired on a timely basis.
Concentration of credit risk in trade receivables is limited as the Groups customer base is large and unrelated.
Accordingly, management consider that there is no further credit risk provision required above the current provision for impairment.
The Group has cash balances deposited for short periods with financial institutions, and enters into certain contracts such as interest rate swaps which entitle the Group to receive future cash flows from financial institutions.
These transactions give rise to credit risk on amounts due from counterparties with a maximum exposure of 888 million 2011: 470 million.
This risk is managed by setting credit and settlement limits for a panel of approved counterparties.
The limits are approved by the Treasury Committee and ratings are monitored regularly.
Market price risk The Group monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing the effect on financial instruments over various periods of a range of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group does not consider it has a material exposure to changes in interest rates.
The Group has estimated that a weakening of sterling by ten per cent against all the currencies in which the Group does business would result in a charge to equity of 14 million 2011: 66 million, arising from the translation of borrowings denominated in foreign currency, and a credit of 8 million to the income statement, arising from the retranslation of interest rate swaps held at fair value through profit or loss 2011: no material effect.
The Group does not require operating businesses to adhere to a formalised risk management policy in respect of trade credit risk or commodity price risk, and does not consider that there is a useful way of quantifying the Groups exposure to any of the macro-economic variables that might affect the collectability of receivables or the prices of commodities.

Additional information continued Additional information about non-GAAP measures of performance Trading profit is defined as operating profit before exceptional items and the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles.
Exceptional items are those material items which by virtue of their size or incidence are presented separately and are excluded from trading profit to enable a clear and consistent presentation of the Groups financial performance.
In addition, the current businesses within the Group have arisen through internal organic growth and through acquisition.
Operating profit includes only the amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles arising on those businesses that have been acquired subsequent to 31 July 2004 and as such does not reflect equally the performance of businesses acquired prior to 31 July 2004 where no amortisation or impairment of acquired intangibles was recognised, businesses that have developed organically where no intangibles are attributed and those businesses more recently acquired where amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles is charged.
The Group believes that trading profit provides valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in assessing the Groups performance since it provides information on the performance of the business that local managers are more directly able to influence and on a basis consistent across the Group.
The Group uses trading profit and certain key performance indicators, calculated by reference to trading profit, for planning, budgeting and reporting purposes and for its internal assessment of the operating performance of individual businesses within the Group.
Additional information about pensions and other long-term employee benefits Description of plans The principal scheme operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final or the average of the last five years of pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes retirement benefits are funded by a salary sacrifice arrangement from employees with the balance being paid by Group companies.
Employees salary sacrifice is either 5 per cent or 8 per cent of earnings depending on the level of benefits accruing.
The Group contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
This scheme was closed to new entrants in 2009.
A defined contribution scheme is also operated.
The principal schemes operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, which are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
The Group also operates two defined benefit schemes in the United States which are closed to new entrants.

The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution scheme.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.

Additional information continued Additional information about pensions and other long-term employee benefits continued Investment policy The Groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally and, if relevant, by the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The Groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the increase in the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the Group of the post-employment plans being lower over the long term and within acceptable boundaries of risk.
For the UK scheme, the policy is to invest approximately 75 per cent of the assets in equities and 25 per cent in other asset classes, principally bonds.
The investment strategy is subject to regular review by the scheme trustees in consultation with the Group.
For the overseas schemes the investment strategy involves the investment in defined levels of predominantly equities with the remainder of the assets being invested in cash and bonds.
