No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Issued under employee share schemes On 30 April 2012, a total of 246,017 shares were issued in satisfaction of shares vesting in accordance with the rules of the Groups Bonus Matching Plan granted in 2009.
Additionally, on 10 February, 14 September and 24 December 2012 a total of 1,776 shares, 873 shares and 1,553 shares respectively were issued on early exercise of options under the Groups SavingsRelated Share Option Plan by three separate individuals whose employment with the Group had terminated due to retirement 28 September 2011: 274 shares, one individual.
No shares were issued in satisfaction of the Bonus Matching Plan for employees whose employment terminated due to retirement.
1 April 2011: 2,456 shares, one individual Share placing As part of the funding for the capital investment required for biomass transformation, on 29 October 2012 the Group placed 36,474,627 shares, representing 9.9% of the existing issued ordinary share capital at that time.
The placing raised gross proceeds of 189.7 million.
Associated transaction costs of 2.0 million have been deducted directly from equity.
16 The placing shares have been credited as fully paid and rank equally in all respects with the existing ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each in the capital of the Company, including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of such shares after the date of issue of the placing shares.
The share placing was achieved through a cash box placing arrangement, which is legally structured such that the merger relief criteria within the Companies Act 2006 apply.
Accordingly, the funds raised in excess of the nominal value of the shares issued have been treated as distributable within retained reserves rather than credited to the share premium account.
As a consequence, of the 187.7 million net proceeds raised, share capital increased by 4.3 million with the balance of 183.4 million increasing retained profits in the year ended 31 December 2012 note 5.
