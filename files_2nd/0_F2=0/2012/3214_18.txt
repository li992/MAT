Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in notes 27 and 28.
The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit from ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, which from 1 April 2012 was 24% 2011: 26%, with the exception of upstream profits, which were taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2011: 30% plus a supplementary charge of 32% 2011: 32%.
On 3 July 2012, the UK Government substantively enacted the restriction on the rate of tax relief on oil and gas decommissioning costs from the current 62% to 50%.
A one-off exceptional charge of 40 million has been recognised from revaluing the related deferred tax provisions.
94 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 9.
Taxation continued Certain upstream assets also bear petroleum revenue tax at 50% 2011: 50%.
Norwegian upstream profits are taxed at the standard rate of 28% 2011: 28% plus a special tax of 50% 2011: 50% resulting in an aggregate tax rate of 78%.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.
The UK Government has announced its intention to propose that Parliament reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 21% by 1 April 2014.
At 31 December 2012 a reduction in the rate to 23% had been substantively enacted so the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these Financial Statements have been based on that rate.
The effect of the additional proposed reduction in the UK corporation tax rate by 2014 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by 18 million.
b Factors affecting the tax charge The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax are as follows: Year ended 31 December 2012 2011 Exceptional items Exceptional items Business and certain Results for Business and certain Results for performance re-measurements the year performance re-measurements the year m m m m m m Profit from continuing operations before tax 2,379 63 2,442 2,062 794 1,268 Less: share of profits in joint ventures and associates, net of interest and taxation 140 6 134 93 26 67 Group profit from continuing operations before tax 2,239 69 2,308 1,969 768 1,201 Tax on profit from continuing operations at standard UK corporation tax rate of 24.5% 2011: 26.5% 549 17 566 522 204 318 Effects of: Net expenses not deductible for tax purposes 77 56 133 20 20 Movement in unrecognised deferred tax assets 20 20 28 31 59 UK petroleum revenue tax rates 149 149 128 128 Overseas tax rates 39 6 45 24 15 9 Additional charges applicable to upstream profits 235 11 246 152 2 154 Changes to tax rates 40 50 10 30 201 171 Adjustments in respect of prior years 34 1 33 Taxation on profit from continuing operations 1,029 140 1,169 810 16 826 c Factors that may affect future tax charges Production of gas and oil within the UK continental shelf is subject to several taxes: corporation tax at 30% 2011: 30% on profits of gas and oil production: a supplementary charge at 32% 2011: 32% on profits of gas and oil production adjusted for financing costs and petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% 2011: 50% on income generated from certain gas and oil production net of certain costs.
PRT is a deductible expense for the purposes of corporation tax and the supplementary charge.
The rate of tax suffered on profits of UK gas production therefore falls between 62% and 81% 2011: 62% and 81%.
To the extent that the Groups profits are earned from UK gas and oil production, its effective tax rate will remain above the current UK statutory rate of 24% 2011: 26%.
Income earned in territories outside the UK, notably in the USA and Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK statutory rate.
In the medium term, the Groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 1,273 million 2011: 421 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,183 million 2011: 5,159 million.
The number of shares excludes six million ordinary shares 2011: seven million, being the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held in the employee share trust.
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements, exceptional items and the impact of Strategic Investments, assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as explained in note 2.
The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows: a Continuing and discontinued operations Year ended 31 December 2012 2011 Pence per Pence per ordinary ordinary m share m share Earnings basic 1,273 24.6 421 8.2 Net exceptional items after taxation notes 2 and 7 481 9.2 522 10.1 Certain re-measurement gains losses after taxation notes 2 and 7 404 7.8 322 6.2 Depreciation of fair value uplifts to property, plant and equipment from Strategic Investments, after taxation 56 1.1 68 1.3 Earnings adjusted basic 1,406 27.1 1,333 25.8 Earnings diluted 1,273 24.4 421 8.1 Earnings adjusted diluted 1,406 27.0 1,333 25.6 Strategic Investments During 2009, the Group acquired a 20% interest in British Energy and the entire share capital of Venture.
As explained in note 2, the depreciation relating to fair value uplifts of the acquired Venture PP&E and associated taxation is excluded in arriving at adjusted earnings for the year, which amounted to 67 million 2011: 64 million depreciation and a taxation credit of 40 million 2011: 37 million in the period.
Additionally, the impact of depreciation arising on fair value uplifts attributed to the British Energy nuclear power stations and related taxation included within the Groups share of the post-taxation results of the associate is excluded in arriving at adjusted earnings for the period, which amounted to 29 million 2011: 41 million net of taxation.

In addition to basic and adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2012 or 2011, however the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of debt and equity.
Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain strong credit ratings.
The Groups credit ratings are important for several reasons, to: maintain a low cost of debt: limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning security arrangements: and ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long term customers.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups long-term credit rating was A3 stable outlook for Moodys Investors Service Limited and Astable outlook for Standard & Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited.
These ratings did not change during 2012.
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Groups credit ratings and significant movements in commodity prices.
A number of financial ratios are monitored, including those used by the credit rating agencies, such as debt to cash flow ratios and adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense.
At 31 December 2012, the ratio of the Groups net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.1 2011: 1.1.
Adjusted EBITDA to gross interest expense for the year ended 31 December 2012 was 8.4 2011: 8.7.
British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL is required under FSA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this requirement in 2012 and 2011.
For the remainder of the Group, the level of debt that can be raised is restricted by the Companys Articles of Association.
Net debt is limited to the greater of 5.0 billion and a gearing ratio of three times adjusted capital and reserves.
Based on adjusted capital and reserves as at 31 December 2012 of 5.9 billion, the limit for net debt was 17.8 billion.
The Group funds its debt principally through issuing bonds.
In addition the Group also maintains substantial committed facilities from banks see note 25, but generally uses these to provide backup liquidity and does not typically draw on them.

Fluctuations in profits from year to year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the current year and taxes paid: and Petroleum revenue tax payments are based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits.
Variations in production from period to period may therefore lead to temporary differences between tax charged and tax paid.

Goodwill and other intangible assets continued c Key assumptions used Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances, with the exception of the impairment tests for the Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil CGUs, where fair value less costs to sell has been used as the basis for determining recoverable amount.
Value in use VIU The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans.
The Groups business plans are based on past experience, and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate.
Commodity prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates.
The extent to which the commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
Note 24 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
i Growth rates and discount rates Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates.
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by external analysts.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
Additionally, risks specific to the cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts.
Each CGUs weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Groups CGUs are provided in the table below: British Gas Direct Energy Direct Energy Direct Energy Business energy British Gas Residential Business Residential and 2012 supply and services Residential services energy supply energy supply business services Growth rate to perpetuity 1.9% 1.9% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Pre-tax discount rate 7.5% 7.5% 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% British Gas Direct Energy Direct Energy Direct Energy Business energy British Gas Residential Business Residential and 2011 supply and services Residential services energy supply energy supply business services Growth rate to perpetuity 2.0% 2.0% 2.1% 2.1% 2.1% Pre-tax discount rate 7.5% 7.5% 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% ii Inflation rates Inflation rates used in the three-year business plan were based on a blend of a number of publicly available inflation forecasts for the UK, Canada and the US.
Inflation rates used for the value in use calculations were as follows: UK: 1.9% 2011: 2.0%, Canada: 2.0% 2011: 2.1% and the US: 2.3% 2011: 2.6%.
iii Key operating assumptions by CGUs using VIU The key operating assumptions across all CGUs are Gross Margin, Revenues and Operating Costs.
Each of these assumptions is tailored to the specific CGU using managements knowledge of the environment, as shown in the table overleaf.

Fair value less costs to sell FVLCS FVLCS is used as the basis for determining the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil.
This methodology is deemed to be more appropriate as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil as a whole.
This is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
Discount rate and cash-flow assumptions, Centrica Energy Upstream gas and oil FVLCS is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas production and development assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCS calculation for the first three years are based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 8.5% 2011: 8.5% to determine the FVLCS.
The discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCS calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described above, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
d Summary of results For all material CGUs, the recoverable amounts exceed their carrying values at the impairment test date.
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amounts of the goodwill balances to be less than the carrying amounts.

Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following is an analysis of the gross deferred tax balances and associated offsetting balances for financial reporting purposes: 31 December 2012 2011 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Gross deferred tax balances crystallising within one year 66 261 187 354 Gross deferred tax balances crystallising after one year 514 1,814 993 2,097 580 2,075 1,180 2,451 Offsetting deferred tax balances 397 397 945 945 Net deferred tax balances after offsetting for financial reporting purposes 183 1,678 235 1,506 At the balance sheet date the Group had certain deductible temporary differences of 382 million 2011: 454 million available for utilisation against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
A significant proportion of these assets may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no temporary differences existed in respect of the Groups overseas investments 2011: nil.
The deferred tax liability arising on these temporary differences is estimated to be nil 2011: nil.

Included within the closing provision are costs related to surplus properties of 26 million 2011: 24 million estimated with reference to the expected cost to be incurred to the point of lease termination, including costs for dilapidations and sub-letting.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2022. ii The non-current element of exceptional restructuring provisions charged in the year are expected to be utilised by 2016. iii Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives.
The estimate has been based on 2P reserves, price levels and technology at the Balance Sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives of the facilities but is expected to occur by 2055, with the majority of the provision being utilised between 2020 and 2030.
The charge to income includes 41 million of notional interest 2011: 40 million.
Additions in the year include 450 million in relation to the Statoil, ConocoPhillips and Total asset purchases see note 30. iv The purchase contract loss provision relates to a number of European gas transportation contracts, the Rijnmond tolling contract and Direct Energy wind farm power purchase agreements see note 7.
The majority of the provisions are expected to be utilised by 2018. v Other provisions include UK contract migration costs, National Insurance payable in respect of Long Term Incentive Scheme liabilities, costs for certain long term takeor-pay contracts renegotiated by the Group in prior years and outstanding litigation for a number of items none of which are individually significant.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2016. vi Includes transfers to from other Balance Sheet accounts.
During 2012, 71 million was transferred from restructuring provisions to pension liabilities in respect of changes to employee pension benefits.
Fair value of financial instruments The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties under no compulsion to act.
The Group has documented internal policies for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.
Financial liabilities 31 December 2012 2011 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Notes m m m m Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: Trade and other payables 21 3,968 3,968 3,609 3,609 Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings: Bank overdrafts and loans 12 369 388 267 274 Bonds 12 4,578 5,119 3,460 3,891 Commercial paper 12 82 82 114 114 Obligations under finance leases 12 299 337 330 328 Provisions 23 350 350 384 384 9,646 10,244 8,164 8,600 Financial liabilities at fair value: Derivative financial instruments 19 942 942 1,645 1,645 Financial assets The carrying values of the Groups financial assets disclosed in notes 12, 18 and 19 are equal to the fair values of those assets.
Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings The fair values of bonds are based on quoted market prices.
The fair values of bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest.
The fair values of overdrafts and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts.
The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Groups cost of borrowing.
Other financial instruments Due to their nature and or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.
Derivative financial instruments and energy contracts designated at fair value through profit or loss The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are determined by reference to closing market rates at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair values of energy derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates not currently supported by observable market data.
The extent to which fair values of energy derivatives are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
110 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
Fair value of financial instruments continued The Group has judged each of the markets in which it operates as active for the purposes of accounting as follows: Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil UK years 2 2 3 2 3 North America years 5 Up to 5 n a Up to 5 3 The fair values of energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 that settle inside the active period of the market are based on quoted market prices and expected volumes, discounted at an average rate of 1% per annum 2011: 1%.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments in North America and Europe are based primarily on quoted market prices.
In the UK, however, certain energy contracts extend beyond the active period of the market.
The fair values of energy contracts that extend beyond the active period of the market are determined by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using valuation techniques based on commodity prices derived using assumptions that are based on internal market expectations and expected volumes, discounted using an average discount rate of 2% per annum for 2012 2011: 2%.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for contracts which extend beyond the active period differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain or loss will arise.
Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available see note S2 for further detail.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the Income Statement relating to the differences between the transaction prices and the amounts that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is as follows: 2012 2011 Net deferred gains losses m m 1 January 59 109 Net losses deferred on new transactions 20 7 Recognised in the Income Statement during the year 2 43 31 December 41 59 Fair value hierarchy Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and held at fair value are classified into one of three categories: 31 December 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Financial assets Derivative financial instruments: Energy derivatives 29 195 139 363 40 318 42 400 Interest rate derivatives 185 185 179 179 Foreign exchange derivatives 33 33 26 26 Treasury gilts designated at fair value through profit or loss 130 130 128 128 Debt instruments 56 2 58 69 3 72 Equity instruments 12 6 18 11 7 18 Total financial assets 227 413 147 787 248 523 52 823 Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments: Energy derivatives 59 570 157 786 169 1,140 206 1,515 Interest rate derivatives 88 88 86 86 Foreign exchange derivatives 68 68 44 44 Total financial liabilities 59 726 157 942 169 1,270 206 1,645 There were no significant transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2012 and 2011.

The impacts of reasonably possible changes to assumed gas, power, coal, emissions and oil prices on the net fair value of the Groups fair value measurements categorised as Level 3 are as follows: 2012 2011 Reasonably possible Reasonably possible Energy price change in variable change in variable UK gas p therm 5 9 UK power MWh 4 6 UK coal US$ tonne 13 13 UK emissions tonne 2 2 UK oil US$ bbl 17 20 2012 2011 Increase decrease in fair value m m UK energy prices increase decrease 17 5 52 38 The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing energy contracts in relation to gas, power, emissions, coal and oil prices to reasonably possible alternative assumptions at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value impacts only concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and are marked-to-market based on valuation models using assumptions that are not currently observable in an active market.
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution, as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
This is because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of energy contracts changes.
Changes in fair values based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated as the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value will not always be linear.
This can be seen in the results from the above sensitivity analysis.
Financial risk management The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The processes for managing these risks are set out in note S3.
The information in this note sets out financial metrics related to these risks.
Transactional and translational currency risks It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of non-functional currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
At 31 December 2012, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions 2011: nil, other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures.
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the net asset numbers in the Groups Financial Statements.
The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is monitored by the GFRMC Group Financial Risk Management Committee.

Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade.
The Group seeks to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It is the Group's policy to maintain committed facilities and or available surplus cash resources of at least 1,200 million, raise at least 75% of its net debt excluding non-recourse debt in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse long-term debt portfolio greater than five years.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of 3,029 million 2011: 3,254 million and 931 million 2011: 518 million of cash and cash equivalents.
130% 2011: 115% of the Groups net debt has been raised in the long-term debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 12.6 years 2011: 9.6 years.

In 2011 there was also a net 8 million cash collateral inflow within discontinued operations.
The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.

Counterparty credit exposure issues remained a focal point within the Group throughout 2012 and the Group continues to be vigilant in managing counterparty risks in accordance with its financial risk management policies.
The period has seen a large number of credit rating downgrades for both financial institutions and European energy majors.
In spite of this, the Group has not altered its rating thresholds for counterparty credit limits and continues to operate within its limits.
In the US and Europe, on-going regulatory changes are resulting in an increase in trading over exchanges or via zero threshold margined contracts.
This helps to reduce counterparty credit risk, but carries increased liquidity requirements.
Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories shown below are included in note S3.
Credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2012 2011 Receivables from Receivables from Derivative financial treasury, trading and Derivative financial treasury, trading and instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash positive fair values counterparties equivalents positive fair values counterparties equivalents m m m m m m AAA to AA 1 78 550 5 128 411 AA to A 392 439 354 469 408 106 BBB to BBB 85 108 2 23 137 BB to BB 71 42 1 20 27 1 B or lower 5 3 1 i Unrated 32 182 24 85 237 581 854 931 605 938 518 i The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses.

Pensions continued The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held in each class and the expected returns on separate asset classes less costs of administering the plan and taxes paid by the plan itself.
The returns on separate asset classes are based on the expected median return over a 10-year period for equities, high-yield debt and property and appropriate market indices for fixed-interest bonds and inflation-linked assets.
These returns are calculated by the independent company actuary, and adjusted for factors specific to the investment portfolio of the Centrica Combined Common Investment Fund.
Included within the Balance Sheet within non-current securities are 61 million 2011: 54 million of investments, held by the Law Debenture Trust on behalf of the Company, as security in respect of the Centrica Unfunded Pension Scheme defined benefit section.
Included within the pension scheme liabilities above are 37 million 2011: 34 million relating to this scheme.
h Pension scheme contributions The UK Registered Pension Schemes were subject to their triennial valuation carried out by Towers Watson, the schemes independent actuaries, at 31 March 2012.
The results of this valuation were approved by the trustees of the schemes on 11 December 2012.
Based on the valuation, the Group and the trustees agreed a revised schedule for deficit payments consisting of an amount of 37 million paid in the year to 31 December 2012 and 77 million per annum from 2013 to 2016.
This payment profile replaces the deficit payments as agreed to in the 2009 triennial valuation.
A continuing charge over the Humber power station provides additional security for the trustees.
On 31 December 2012 the Group and the trustees also agreed to partially fund the deficit payments using an asset-backed contribution arrangement.
Under the arrangement, certain loans to UK Group companies were transferred to a Scottish Limited Partnership established by the Group.
The Group made a special contribution to the UK Registered Pension Schemes of 84 million: on the same date the schemes used this contribution to acquire an interest in the partnership for its fair value of 84 million.
The schemes partnership interests entitle them to a distribution from the income of the partnership of 22 million per annum for 4 years.
The partnership is controlled by Centrica and its results are consolidated by the Group.
As the trustees interest in the partnership does not meet the definition of a plan asset under IAS 19, it is not reflected in the Balance Sheet.
Distributions from the partnership to the schemes will be recognised as scheme assets in the future as they occur.
Deficit payments are also being made in respect of the Direct Energy Marketing Limited Pension Plan in Canada.
4 million was paid in the year to 31 December 2012 and 7 million per annum is to be paid from 2013 to 2016 and 3 million in 2017.
The Group also estimates that it will pay 105 million of ordinary employer contributions during 2013 at an average rate of 21% of pensionable pay.

Business combinations and asset purchases Principal acquisitions made during the year are described below.
Business combinations The business combinations are immaterial in aggregate to the Groups consolidated Financial Statements.
The fair values are provisional unless stated otherwise.
Carrot Creek On 10 January 2012, the Group acquired control of a business comprising a portfolio of interests in a number of gas assets located in west central Alberta, Canada from Encana Corporation for CA$59 million 37 million in cash and Direct Energys existing Entice asset with a fair value of CA$48 million 30 million.
No goodwill arose on the acquisition.
The acquisition allows the Group to grow its North American Upstream gas business.
The acquisition is included in the Direct Energy Upstream and wholesale energy segment.
120 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30. Business combinations and asset purchases continued Home Warranty of America On 1 March 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of Home Warranty Holding Corporation as well as the assets of HWOA LLC HWA for total cash consideration of $52 million 32 million including $10 million 6 million of deferred consideration.
Goodwill of $47 million 29 million arose on the acquisition, of which 40% is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
HWA is a US home warranty protection plan company.
The acquisition allows Direct Energy to sell home protection plans nationwide and provides further growth and integration opportunities.
The acquisition is included in the Direct Energy Residential and business services segment.
Energetix Inc and NYSEG Solutions Inc On 22 August 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of New York based energy retailers Energetix Inc. and NYSEG Solutions Inc. for total cash consideration of $121 million 77 million including $5 million 3 million of deferred consideration.
Goodwill of $43 million 27 million arose on the acquisition, of which 100% is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
This acquisition will further strengthen Direct Energys position as a leading competitive energy retailer in the US Northeast, increasing the number of residential and small commercial customer accounts by approximately 245,000.
The acquisition is included in the Direct Energy Residential energy supply and Business energy supply segments.
Goodwill recognised on the above acquisitions is attributable to enhanced geographical presence, cost savings, synergies and growth opportunities.
2011 Business Combinations fair value updates During the year, there have been no significant updates to the fair value entries posted in relation to acquisitions which occurred in 2011.
The net impact of fair value updates on goodwill is an increase of 18 million.
Asset purchases Statoil asset acquisition On 30 April 2012, the Group completed its acquisition of certain oil and gas production and development assets in the Norwegian North Sea from Statoil for total cash consideration of 770 million with an additional payment of up to $100 million 62 million contingent on future production performance.
In addition, a tax liability of 144 million was assumed which is included in the purchase cost.
ConocoPhillips asset acquisition On 30 April 2012, the Group completed its acquisition of certain non-operated interests in the gas and oil producing Statfjord field and associated satellite fields from ConocoPhillips for total cash consideration of 141 million.
As part of this transaction, a pre-existing contract with ConocoPhillips with a fair value of 20 million asset was novated so that it is now entirely between Group companies.
Accordingly, the value of this contract forms part of the asset acquisition cost.
In addition, a tax liability of 25 million was assumed which is included in the purchase cost.
Total asset acquisition During the year, the Group completed its acquisition of a portfolio of non-operated interests in producing oil and gas assets in the UK North Sea from Total for total cash consideration of 133 million.
The acquisition of the interests was executed through separate purchase agreements which completed on 11 May, 1 August and 23 August 2012.
Certain assets in the original portfolio, when the deal was announced in February 2012, were not acquired since pre-emption rights in the respective fields were exercised.
These asset purchases will help to deliver UK energy security and further expand the Groups upstream business.
The acquisitions are included within the Centrica Energy Gas segment.
Disposals, discontinued operations and disposal groups held for sale On 30 April 2012, the Group disposed of a 50% interest in its Round 3 wind farm, which resulted in a profit on disposal of 43 million.
On 1 June 2011, the Group completed its planned disposal of its European segment with the sale of the trade and assets of Oxxio B. V. for a total consideration of 111 million, which resulted in a loss on disposal of 56 million.

Auditors remuneration continued It is the Groups policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects.
Appointments are made taking into account factors including expertise, experience and cost.
In addition, the Audit Committee has approved a detailed policy defining the types of work for which the Companys auditors can tender and the approvals required.
In the past, the auditors have been engaged on assignments in addition to their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly important, including due diligence reporting and reporting accountant services on acquisitions.
Commitments and contingencies a Commitments The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement contracts.
Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.
They also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.
The commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts, where there is a right of set-off with the counterparty.
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
The commitments disclosed below are based on the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices.
The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note 25.
Whilst the commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note 25.
In addition, the volumes used in calculating the maturity analysis in note 25 are estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities and in note 25 there is no offset of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts where there is a right of set-off with the counterparty.
31 December 2012 2011 m m Commitments in relation to the acquisition of property, plant and equipment: Acquisition of Statoil oil and gas assets 983 Development of Norwegian oil and gas assets 283 Development of Cygnus gas field 88 Development of York gas field 82 Other capital expenditure 21 87 Commitments in relation to the acquisition of intangible assets: i Renewable obligation certificates to be purchased from joint ventures 1,376 1,377 Renewable obligation certificates to be purchased from other parties 784 774 EUAs and CERs 42 44 iv Other intangible assets 105 193 Other commitments: ii Commodity purchase contracts 51,933 58,311 LNG capacity 844 844 Transportation capacity 936 969 Outsourcing of services 277 348 Commitments to invest in joint ventures 174 234 Other long term commitments 562 777 Operating lease commitments: iii iv Future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases 974 950 i Renewable obligation certificates are purchased from several joint ventures which produce power from wind energy under long term offtake agreements up to 15 years.
The commitments disclosed above are the gross contractual commitments and do not take into account the Groups economic interest in the joint venture.
ii At 31 December the maturity analysis for commodity purchase contracts was: 1 year 9.2 billion, 1-2 years 7.2 billion, 2-3 years 5.9 billion, 3-4 years 5.1 billion, 4-5 years 3.0 billion and 5 years 21.5 billion 2011: 1 year 10.3 billion, 1-2 years 8.0 billion, 2-3 years 6.3 billion, 3-4 years 5.6 billion, 4-5 years 4.7 billion and 5 years 23.4 billion.
iii At 31 December the maturity analysis for the total minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases was: 1 year 222 million, 1-2 years 98 million, 2-3 years 82 million, 3-4 years 64 million, 4-5 years 54 million and 5 years 454 million 2011: 1 year 157 million, 1-2 years 130 million, 2-3 years 88 million, 3-4 years 65 million, 4-5 years 54 million and 5 years 456 million.

122 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 33.
Commitments and contingencies continued Lease payments recognised as an expense in the year were as follows: Year ended 31 December 2012 2011 m m Minimum lease payments net of sub-lease receipts 125 126 i Contingent rents renewables 130 132 i The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption certificates from renewable sources.
Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment 2011: nil.
Payments made for physical power are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents.
b Guarantees and indemnities In connection with the Groups energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in creditworthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
The Group has provided a number of guarantees and indemnities in respect of decommissioning costs: the two most significant indemnities relate to the decommissioning costs associated with the Morecambe and Statfjord fields.
These indemnities are to the previous owners of these fields.
Under the licence conditions of the fields, the previous owners will have exposure to the decommissioning costs should these liabilities not be fully discharged by the Group.
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the associated gas field falls below a predetermined proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant legal decommissioning notices in respect of the relevant fields have been revoked.
c Contingent liabilities Under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target CERT scheme, British Gas was required to meet a variety of carbon emissions reduction targets by 31 December 2012.
Ofgem has indicated that mitigating actions undertaken after this date will also be taken into account when assessing delivery.
Accordingly the Group believes it will have fulfilled the CERT requirements.
Ofgem is still to formally conclude on the Groups compliance and has the option of enforcement action if they consider the targets have not been met.

Nuclear new build and share repurchase programme As part of the 2009 transaction to acquire a 20% interest in British Energy, EDF Energy and the Group formed an 80 20 arrangement to undertake pre-development activities for a nuclear new build programme, with the intention of constructing, operating and decommissioning four European Pressurised Nuclear Reactors.
On 4 February 2013, the Group announced its decision not to proceed with this nuclear new build investment.
Accordingly, the Group has recorded an impairment of 231 million at the year end.
No further impairments are expected as a result of this decision and the Groups 20% interest in the existing nuclear power stations in the UK remains unaffected.
As a result of this decision, the Group also announced on 4 February 2013 its intention to launch a 500 million share repurchase programme to return surplus capital to shareholders, to be conducted over 12 months.
