It included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 23%, with effect from 1 April 2013.
The lower rate of 23% has been used to determine the overall net deferred tax liability, as the temporary differences are expected to reverse at a lower rate.
The March 2012 budget announced a further 1% reduction in the main rate of corporation tax.
A lower rate of 24%, from 1 April 2012, was enacted in July 2012, with the intention for the rate to reduce further, by 1% per annum, to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The proposed rate reduction to 22% had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is not included, therefore, in the financial statements.
The impact of the further change in rate, from 23% to 22%, applied to the deferred tax balance at 29 July 2012 would be to increase profit after tax for the year by 2.9 million and increase other comprehensive losses by 0.7 million in July 2013.
