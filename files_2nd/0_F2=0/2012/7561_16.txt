Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2012 Income taxes The Group recognises expected liabilities for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes due, which requires significant judgement as to the ultimate tax determination of certain items.
Where the actual liability arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period when such determination is made.
Allowances against the carrying value of inventories The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future demand requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels.
Factors that could impact estimated demand and selling prices are the timing and success of product ranges.
Allowances against the carrying value of trade receivables Using information available at the balance sheet date, the Group reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes judgements based on an assessment of debt ageing, past experience, or known customer circumstances in order to determine the appropriate level of allowance required to account for potential uncollectable trade receivables.

Closure of Howden Joinery Supply Division Asia Ltd: During the current period, the Group made the decision to close the Hong Kong registered 100% owned Group subsidiary company Howden Joinery Supply Division Asia Ltd, which had previously carried out sourcing operations for the Group in Asia.
By the end of the period, the management of all sourcing from Asia had been transfered to the Groups UK sourcing team.
Prior to the decision to close the company, the Group was recognising associated goodwill with a carrying value of 2.5m.
Once the decision had been made to close the company, this goodwill was written off in full, as shown above and in note 14.
Closure of the company had begun by the end of the current period, and it is anticipated that the company will be placed into administration during 2013.
A provision for closure costs has been set up in the current period, and utilisation of the provision has begun.
More details of the provision are given in note 23.
The company did not have any external customers.
The cost of the goods which it sourced were recharged within the Group and accordingly were eliminated on consolidation.
Thus there is no revenue shown for this discontinued operation.
The only expenses which are shown in both current and prior periods are the incremental costs which the Group incurred as a result of carrying out business through this company e. g. the salaries, ofce rent, and other similar administrative costs of running the sourcing operation in Asia.
Closure of Southon Insurance Company Ltd: Southon Insurance Company Ltd was a 100% owned Group subsidiary company, registered and licensed to carry on insurance business in Guernsey.
In the past, the company had reinsured potential liabilities under certain product guarantees issued by former Group companies.
It had also reinsured certain legacy Group employers liabilities and public liability.
The company ceased underwriting in December 2007, and during the current period it has terminated all residual liabilities.
As part of the process of terminating these liabilities, it paid a commutation premium of 0.4m to dispose of liabilities with a book value of 0.8m, as shown above.
By the end of the current period, the company had received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission to surrender its insurance licence, and the company had been put into the hands of liquidators.
The company did not have any external customers in either the current or prior period.
Its only income and expenses in both periods were insignicant amounts of investment income and administration expenses, therefore there is no significant revenue, costs, or pre-tax or post-tax profit or loss to disclose in either period.

All deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised at 23% 2011: 25%.
Permanent differences arise in relation to share schemes, resulting from a difference between the accounting and tax treatments.
In accordance with IAS 12, the excess of current and deferred tax over and above the related cumulative remuneration expense under IFRS 2 has been recognised directly in equity.
This arises mainly due to the Group assuming no tax relief for the payments and provisions made in association with the legacy properties until the tax position is agreed with HMRC.

Prior to that, HJ Asia was a 50% owned joint venture, with no associated goodwill.
During the current period, the Group has made the decision to close the operations of HJ Asia, and has accordingly derecognised the associated goodwill.
The derecognition of goodwill, together with other costs related to the closure of HJ Asia, have been treated as a discontinued exceptional item in the current period see note 6 for further details.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.
The Group also has carried forward capital losses and the related potential deferred tax asset of 19.6m 2011: 21.3m which has not been recognised.
Both of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m Balance at start of period 8.7 9.2 Decrease in allowance recognised in the Income Statement 0.6 0.5 Balance at end of period 8.1 8.7 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 29.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
85 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable or require provision.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specic amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance, which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 8.1m 2011: 8.7m consists of a specic provision of 3.8m 2011: 4.2m which has been made against specic debts with a gross carrying value of 4.8m 2011: 4.8m, and a provision of 4.3m 2011: 4.5m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
5.6m debts were written off in the period 2011: 5.9m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specic debtor balances with customers totalling 13.6m before bad debt provision 2011: 13.7m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m 130 days past due 7.3 6.9 3160 days past due 1.0 1.3 6190 days past due 0.8 0.7 90 days past due 4.5 4.8 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 13.6 13.7 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts, or is placed on short-term deposit with maturity periods of less than three months.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
As explained in the accounting policy note, and as noted at the foot of the consolidated cash ow statement, this denition differs slightly from the denition of cash and cash equivalents, which is used in the cash ow statement, and which includes overdrafts repayable on demand.
Assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure bank borrowings.

The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 46 days 2011: 48 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.

The fees are then amortised over the life of the facility.
During the current period, the Group extended its facility, which had previously been due to expire in May 2014, to July 2016.
The additional fees payable on extension were capitalised, together with the unamortised portion of the existing fees, and these fees are being amortised over the period to July 2016.
At the current period end, the amount of fees relating to the period in excess of one year from the balance sheet date were greater than the corresponding amounts drawn down under the facility, thereby creating a net debit balance as shown above.
All bank borrowings are in sterling, and are drawn under the 160m 2011: 160m committed bank facility.
The terms of this facility are explained further in the final paragraph of note 29 a.
This facility is secured on the property, other assets, and investments of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets are as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time and can never exceed 160m.
In accordance with the terms of the facility agreement this limit will be reduced to 140m in May 2014.
As at 29 December 2012, the Group had available 126m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 24 December 2011: 145m.
In June 2012 the facility was extended until July 2016.
The loan carries interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin.
From March 2011 to maturity, the margin will vary between 200 and 250 basis points and will be determined by the Groups rolling Adjusted profit Before Tax.

All of the finance lease obligations are in sterling.
Each lease contract is at a xed interest rate.
The finance lease obligations were unsecured, and the average remaining lease term at the period end was 3 years and 3 months.

Under the terms of this scheme, employees will make pension contributions out of their salaries, and the Group will also make additional contributions.
The Group decided to give employees the option to enter this scheme earlier than the mandatory start date, and so the auto-enrolment scheme was open to employees from November 2012 on a voluntary, opt-in, basis.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 0.1m 2011: nil represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
The Group operates a dened contribution scheme for its employees.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group, and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This scheme began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 0.9m 2011: 1.1m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
The Group operates a funded pension scheme which provides benets based on the pensionable pay of participating employees.
This scheme will be closed to new entrants from April 2013.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation, the related current service cost, and past service cost are determined by a qualied actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2011 by the scheme actuary.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the results of the 5 April 2011 valuation to 29 December 2012, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.

2011 and 2012: Females S1PFA, CMI 2010 core projections with a long-term improvement rate of 1.5% p. a.
Note: The underlying S1PMA and S1PFA tables are also adjusted by scaling factors.
Separate scaling factors apply to males and females and to the different categories of members.
The mortality assumption adopted by the Group in 2012 and 2011 is equivalent to the following life expectancies: 2012 2011 Male yrs Female yrs Male yrs Female yrs Non-pensioner age 45 89.2 91.6 89.1 91.5 Pensioner age 65 88.4 89.4 88.2 89.2 If there was an increase decrease in the discount rate of 0.25%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 4.7%, or 41m, and a decrease increase in the current service cost of around 6% or 0.7m.
An increase of 0.25% to the ination rate would increase scheme liabilities by around 18m, or 2%, and would increase current service cost by around 0.6m or 5%.
A decrease of 0.25% to the ination rate would decrease scheme liabilities by around 13m, or 1.5%, and would reduce current service cost by around 0.4m, or 3%.
The effect of changing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 3% or 25m, and would increase current service cost by around 0.3m or 2%.

A single long-term assumption is then calculated as the weighted average of the actual asset allocation and the long-term assumption for each asset class.

94 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2012 23 PROVISIONS Property provision Other provision Business closure Total m m m m At 25 December 2010 54.4 1.5 55.9 Additional provision in the period 8.0 3.3 11.3 Utilisation of provision in the period 29.4 2.5 31.9 At 24 December 2011 33.0 2.3 35.3 Additional provision in the period 1.3 3.2 1.0 5.5 Provision released in the period 0.1 0.1 Utilisation of provision in the period 16.4 2.1 0.1 18.6 At 29 December 2012 17.8 3.4 0.9 22.1 Property provision The property provision covers onerous leases on any non-trading leased properties.
For some properties, the provision is based on the shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable.
For other properties, where negotiations to surrender the lease are in progress, the provision is based on the amount which the landlord has indicated that they are willing to take as a premium in order for the Group to surrender the lease.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group considers that it can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning, or surrendering the lease.
Throughout the course of the period the Group reviews the range of options for unused properties, and maintains ongoing discussions with landlords and external agents, with a view to identifying possible lease surrenders and nding tenants.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties, and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.2m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
This amount is shown as a finance charge in note 10.
There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision at note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash ows has been adjusted to reect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outows under this provision are expected to take place over a number or years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
The timing of outows from the provision is variable, and is dependent on property lease expiry dates and on opportunities to surrender leases.
Other provision The other provision relates to amounts due in respect of product warranties.
As products are sold, the Group makes provision for claims under warranties.
As claims are made, the Group utilises the provision and then uses this data to periodically revise the basis on which it makes further provision.
Business closure provision The provision for business closure relates to the costs of closure of the Group subsidiary company Howden Joinery Supply Division Asia Ltd. More details of this are provided in note 6.
The provision represents managements best estimate of the costs of closing the business, which are mainly staff costs and the costs of closing the Companys ofce in Hong Kong.
The decision to close the business was made in the current period, and some expenses related to the closure have already been incurred in the current period and set against the provision, as shown above.
The timing of the remaining outows from the provision is expected to occur within the next 12 months.

At the period end, the Group had a 160m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on four sub-facilities stock, trade receivables, property and a cash ow facility.
The facility limit was the lower of 160m and the sum of the four sub-facilities.
The property component initially 17.4m amortises at the rate of 141,667 each month, whereas the other components act as a revolving credit facility with no amortisation.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business, ii allows up to 20m of additional secured borrowings, and iii allows up to 10m of finance lease borrowing.
During the period the maturity of the facility was extended from May 2014 to July 2016.
As part of that extension the facility was reduced from 160m to 140m in May 2014.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2011.

c Categories of financial instruments 29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m Financial assets current and non-current Trade receivables 71.2 73.0 Cash and cash equivalents 96.7 59.4 Financial liabilities current and non-current Trade payables 60.4 68.1 Borrowings 0.3 2.3 d Financial risk management General The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks.
The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantication of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below subcategorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash ow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as dened immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 19.
105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 19.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds through adherence to a policy of minimum long-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors A and Moodys A2.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 71.2 73.0 Cash and cash equivalents 96.7 59.4 Total credit risk exposure 167.9 132.4 f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows and matching the maturity proles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 21 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Financial Review contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
106 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2012 Maturity prole of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash ows.

107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued g Market risk This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will uctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to several currencies, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent, from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m Euro Trade receivables 1.5 2.6 Cash and cash equivalents 2.8 2.4 Trade payables 12.6 8.9 8.3 3.9 US Dollar Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents 4.0 3.7 Trade payables 1.8 1.9 2.2 1.8 Hong Kong Dollar Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.1 Trade payables 0.1 0.1 Chinese Yuan Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 Trade payables 0.1 Japanese Yen Trade receivables Cash and cash equivalents Trade payables 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Total 6.1 1.8 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the parent company has borrowed funds at oating interest rates.
The Board has reviewed this risk of interest rate increases causing financial distress and concluded that hedging protection should only be considered if net borrowings or cash surpluses were to exceed 150m.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Payments on the Groups finance leases are xed on inception of the lease contract, and as such are regarded as xed rate borrowings.
108 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2012 h Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its period end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the period end date was outstanding for the whole period.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are xed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to repricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates: Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for oating rate nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would remain the same 2011: remain the same.
For a decrease of 50 basis points, the current year gures would remain the same 2011: remain the same.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, US dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen exchange rates the Hong Kong dollar being effectively pegged to the US dollar.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, the US Dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese Yuan, and the Japanese Yen.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial period and held constant throughout the reporting period.
29 December 2012 24 December 2011 m m 10% weakening of Sterling to Euro 0.9 0.4 10% strengthening of Sterling to Euro 0.7 0.4 10% weakening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 0.2 10% strengthening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 0.2 The Groups sensitivity, on the basis above, to a strengthening or weakening of Sterling to the Hong Kong Dollar, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen was less than 0.1m at both the current and prior period ends.
