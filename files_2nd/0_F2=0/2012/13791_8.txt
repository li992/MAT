We are currently in the middle of an investment programme that saw the Bravo platform installed in 2012 and the arrival of the Atwood Mako rig for a 16 well development drilling campaign that will drive average daily production in 2013 up by a minimum of 50%.
The next phase of the project involves driving operating costs down and to this end power and processing modules 1 are being constructed in 2013 for installation on the Bravo platform early in 2014.
This will then facilitate the replacement of the FPSO that is currently on location with a FSO FSO day rates are approximately 50% lower than for FPSO.
The Group has signed a LOI with Teekay for an FSO that is scheduled to be on location in mid-2014.

Outside of the Bualuang area, the DrillCo-1 land rig arrived on location at the Kerendan gas eld in Central Kalimantan to begin development drilling.
This will lead to production growth from 2014, further diversifying the Groups production basis.
In the North Kutei, the Groups high impact exploration drilling programme commenced in the fourth quarter of 2012.
This campaign got off to an encouraging start and we announced in February 2013 that the South Kecapi-1 well was an oil and gas discovery which owed 6,000 bopd on test.
The North Kendang-1 well is currently drilling, and on completion the rig will move to drill the Bedug prospect.
Production Production for the year averaged 10,800 boepd and in 2013 the Group expects daily production to average between 12,500 and 15,500 boepd.
Production in 2012 was down year on year following the decision to sell the Offshore Northwest Java and Southeast Sumatra PSCs in the second half of 2011 and to re-invest the capital into growing production from elds that produce higher value barrels.

22 Business review Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 The Kerendan eld development is the anchor project for the Greater Kerendan region and the development drilling programme is improving our understanding of the sub-surface in the area.
Using the knowledge gained, the exploration drilling programme will start during the second quarter of 2013 with the drilling of the West Kerendan and Sungai Lahei prospects.
The drill-pad is at an advanced stage of preparation for the exploration drilling.
The West Kerendan and Sungai Lahei prospects contain a combined mean prospective resource of 900 Bcf.
In the event of success, the Group will look to commercialise the discovered volume through construction of a pipeline from Greater Kerendan to the gas markets in East Kalimantan.
Beyond these two prospects, there are further 1 prospects contained in the Bangkanai PSC, including the large Jupoi surface anticline.
The Group also anticipates being awarded two new licences adjacent to the Bangkanai PSC providing further growth opportunities in the basin.

The Ocean 2 General semi-submersible rig was contracted as part of a four company consortium and drilling started on the Bontang PSC in December 2012 with the South Kecapi-1 exploration well and has continued through the first quarter of 2013.
The South Kecapi-1 well encountered over 40 metres of net oil and gas pay in high quality stacked Pliocene channel sandstones.
The shallower BT18-BT25 channels contained 29 metres of net gas pay in thick channel sandstones, although the volume encountered is not thought to be commercial on a stand-alone basis.
In the deeper BT45 Pliocene channels, 11 metres of net oil pay was encountered and owed light oil at a constrained rate of 6,000 bopd when tested.
