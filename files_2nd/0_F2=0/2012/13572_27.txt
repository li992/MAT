The reductions to 24 per cent effective from 1 April 2012 and 23 per cent effective from 1 April 2013 were substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively.
As the rate change to 23 per cent was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate.
The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity.
Accordingly, in 2012, 24m has been credited to the income statement, 3m has been charged to the OCI and 3m has been charged directly to equity.
Had the further tax rate changes been substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date it would have had the effect of reducing the deferred tax asset by 15m and reducing the deferred tax liability by 33m.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 144m 2011 178m.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the potential withholding tax due on the remittance of undistributed profits as the Group is able to control the timing of such remittances and it is probable that consent will not be given in the foreseeable future.
