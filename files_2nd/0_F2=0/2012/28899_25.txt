FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The duration analysis above is presented on an undiscounted basis.
The carrying values in the statement of financial position are discounted where appropriate in accordance with Group accounting policy.
The capital and interest payable on the bonds and notes has been included until the dates on which the Group has the option to call the instruments and the interest rates are reset.
For further information on the terms of the bonds and notes see note 19 to the financial statements.
Undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest as detailed in note 19.
Year end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies.
Capital management The maintenance of a strong capital position is critical to the Groups ability to conduct business.
The Group maintains sufficient capital, which comprises shareholders equity and subordinated loan capital, to meet its plan and objectives.
This represents sufficient surpluses for both regulatory and economic capital, as well as sufficient capital to support the Groups aim of maintaining single A ratings.
To provide protection against material events or shocks, the Group would normally expect to hold appropriate levels of capital to maintain sufficient economic and regulatory surpluses.
The maintenance of a capital position in excess of regulatory requirements is an absolute requirement for all of the Groups regulated entities.
There is no tolerance for breaching capital requirements for any regulated entity.
The Groups regulated entities hold appropriate levels of capital to satisfy applicable local regulations.
In certain instances this could restrict the subsidiaries ability to transfer funds to the UK parent where retained earnings form part of the local required regulatory capital.
Additionally, regulation in certain countries in which the Groups subsidiaries operate may also impose other limitations such as foreign exchange control restrictions.
Economic capital Economic capital is the Groups preferred measure of capital sufficiency.
It is the Groups own assessment of the amount of capital it needs to hold to meet its obligations given the Groups risk appetite.
Assets and liabilities are valued on an economic basis providing the most realistic representation of the Groups financial position.
The economic capital analysis compares the economic value of the Groups assets with the total resources required in a range of adverse scenarios, calibrated to a defined risk tolerance consistent with the Groups A rating which is in line with target.
The economic capital surplus is the amount by which the economic assets exceed the total resources required.
The total resources required is the amount of assets the Group needs today to meet its liabilities under the defined risk tolerance.
The Group defines the economic capital required as the difference between the total resource requirement and the accounting value of liabilities.
At 31 December 2012, the Groups surplus economic capital calibrated to Standard & Poors long-term A rated bond default curve was approximately 0.7bn 2011: 0.8bn.
When calibrated to a risk tolerance of insolvency of 1 in 200 per annum the ECA surplus was 1.2m 31 December 2011: 1.2bn.
The position was adversely impacted in the year by falling yields and increased acquisitions offset by an improvement in expected future retained profits.
The economic capital model is used to support, inform and improve the Groups decision making across the Group.
It is used to determine the Groups optimum capital structure, its investment strategy, its reinsurance programme and to determine the pricing and target returns for each portfolio.
The economic capital model is also used for the Groups Individual Capital Assessment ICA.
The only adjustment made is to use the FSAs required calibration.
Annual Report and Accounts 2012 | RSA | 101 RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Regulatory solvency position The Group remains fully compliant with both the FSAs risk based ICA methodology and Solvency I, which is used to calculate the Insurance Groups Directive IGD requirement.
For the Groups senior regulated insurance company, Royal & SunAlliance Insurance plc, the capital position continues to be reported under Solvency I.
As at 31 December 2012 the Group has an IGD surplus of approximately 1.2bn 2011: 1.3bn.
Whilst the IGD surplus remains strong it has experienced a small decrease in the year with retained earnings being offset by increases in both capital requirements resulting from higher business volumes and increased goodwill and intangible assets.
The coverage ratio stood at 1.9 times at 31 December 2012 2011: 2.0 times.
The Group received its latest Individual Capital Guidance based on its ICA submission from the FSA in late 2011 and at the request of the FSA remains confidential.
The ICA is a forward looking, economic assessment of the capital requirements of the Group based on its assessment of the risks to which it is exposed.
The models used to determine the ICA have been integrated into the Groups business processes and are used to enhance the management of the Group.

OPERATING SEGMENTS From 1 January 2012, the Group is organised into four operating segments, Scandinavia, Canada, UK & Western Europe, and Emerging Markets with each operating segment managed by a Chief Executive Officer CEO who is directly accountable to the Group Chief Executive and the Board of Directors.
Each of the CEOs is also a member of the Group Executive Committee.
Scandinavia, Canada and UK & Western Europe represent the major geographical areas in which the Group operates through established businesses in mature markets.
The UK is the Groups country of domicile and one of its principal markets.
Western Europe includes the operations in Ireland and Italy.
Emerging Markets comprises the Groups operations in Latin America, Asia and Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East.

The Group uses the following key measures to assess the performance of its operating segments: r Net written premiums r Underwriting result r Combined operating ratio COR.
Net written premiums is the key measure of revenue used in internal reporting.
Underwriting result and COR are the key internal measures of profitability of the operating segments.
The COR reflects the ratio of claims costs and expenses including commission to premiums, expressed as a percentage.
As described in the Risk Management section of the notes to the financial statements sufficient net assets are maintained by each of the Groups subsidiaries to satisfy local regulatory and internal risk based capital requirements.
In addition the Group monitors the Groups total capital position at all times.
Assets and liabilities are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker at the Group level, and as such are not presented at the operating segment level.
All of these items are measured in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
Certain items included within the Groups investment result are allocated to the operating segments based on economic capital requirements.
Transfers or transactions between segments are entered into under normal commercial terms and conditions that would also be available to unrelated third parties.
Management basis The management basis reflects the way management monitor the business.
Operating result on a management basis comprises the underwriting result, the investment result and other activities.
Major components of underwriting result are net earned premiums, other operating income, net claims incurred, acquisition costs and other underwriting costs.
Other activities comprise administration expenses, ongoing investment in the Groups operations in Central and Eastern Europe and other expenses of 89m 2011: 99m, which includes the Group share in the loss after tax of its associates of 6m 2011: 9m.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ORDINARY SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY The earnings per ordinary share are calculated by reference to the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders and the weighted average of shares in issue during the year.
Basic Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders of the Parent Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding ordinary shares purchased by various share trusts and held as own shares.

The Parent Company has share options and contingently issuable shares as categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The calculation is performed for the dilutive potential ordinary shares to determine the number of shares that could have been issued at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Parent Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the dilutive potential ordinary shares.

The proposed dividend will be paid and accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the year ending 31 December 2013.
The Group subsidiaries may be subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to shareholders as a result of local regulatory requirements.
However, based on the information currently available, the Group does not believe that such restrictions materially impact the ability to meet obligations or pay dividends.
The trustees of the Royal & SunAlliance ESOP Trust and the Royal & SunAlliance ESOP Trust No 2 waived their entitlement to dividends except for a nominal amount which reduced the total dividend paid by less than 1m 2011: less than 1m.

When testing for impairment, the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cashflow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five to ten year period.
Cashflows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates which do not exceed the long-term average past growth rate for the insurance business in which the CGU operates.
A number of other assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of a cashflow model to forecast operating cashflows, premium volumes, expenses and working capital requirements.
Forecasts of future cashflows are based on the best estimates of future premiums, operating expenses and taxes using historical trends, general geographical market conditions, industry trends and forecasts and other available information.
These assumptions are subject to review by management.
The cashflow forecasts are adjusted by appropriate discount rates.
Discount rates used in 2012 are within a range of 6% to 24% 2011: 8% to 21%, are post tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments at the date of evaluation.
The weighted average growth rates used in 2012 are within a range of 2% to 13% 2011: 3% to 13%.

A deferred tax asset of 141m 2011: 148m has been recognised in respect of losses and unused tax credits.
In addition, the Group recognised 89m 2011: 80m in respect of other deferred tax reliefs.
These are included within other temporary differences at 31 December 2012.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 1,568m 2011: 1,572m tax losses and unused tax credits of 11m 2011: 11m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses include 176m 2011: 194m which will expire between 2013 and 2032, of which 68m 2011: 87m have been recognised for deferred tax.
Other tax losses and unused credits may be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group does not recognise deferred tax on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the Group is able to control the remittance of earnings to the UK and there is no intention to remit any such earnings to the UK in the foreseeable future if the remittance would trigger a material incremental tax liability.
The temporary difference in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates is 893m 2011: 965m.
Deferred tax assets of 241m 2011: 199m, which are in excess of profits arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and that relate to tax jurisdictions in which the Group has suffered a loss in either the current or preceding period, have been recognised on the basis that future taxable profits will be available against which these can be utilised.
The evidence for the future taxable profits is a forecast consistent with the three year operational plans prepared by the relevant businesses, which are subject to internal review and challenge.
Where relevant, the forecast includes extrapolations of the operational plans using assumptions consistent with those used in the plans.

The liabilities arising under the ADC contract comprise an insurance component and a deposit component.
The liability arising under the insurance component represents the timing risk on the settlement of those liabilities.
The financial liability arising under the deposit component is offset by the value of funds held in a trust fund whose trust deed only permits the trust fund assets to be used to settle amounts due under the ADC.
The value of the funds held in trust at 31 December 2011 was 0.1bn and the value of the liability of the deposit component was 0.1bn.
The deposit component of the liability was fully paid during 2012.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes, funded and unfunded defined benefit pension schemes, and has other post retirement obligations.
Defined contribution pension schemes Costs of 68m 2011: 65m were recognised in respect of defined contribution schemes by the Group.
The Groups Swedish subsidiaries are part of a multi-employer defined benefit scheme along with other financial institutions in Sweden.
As it is not possible to determine the assets and liabilities in respect of any one employer under this scheme, it is included in these accounts as a defined contribution scheme.
Contributions of 13m 2011: 14m were paid to this scheme during 2012 and are included in the costs shown above.
The latest information regarding the funding of this scheme is taken from the interim report for the first half of 2012, when the scheme funding rate was 104% 2011: 115%.
Defined benefit pension schemes and other post retirement benefits The major defined benefit pension schemes are located in the UK.
The assets of these schemes are held mainly in separate trustee administered funds.
In April 2002, the primary UK defined benefit schemes were effectively closed to new entrants and in 2005, following discussions with the Trustees and consultation with the members, the UK defined benefit schemes were altered from providing benefits on a final salary basis to benefits on a revalued average salary basis with effect from 1 January 2006.
Under the new benefit formula, the accrued benefits of current active members are based on salaries at the date of change and will increase in line with inflation each year limited to 5% in any year up to their retirement date.
Benefits earned in each year from 1 January 2006 are based on salaries in that year and are revalued up to retirement.
In addition to these changes, the 2002 Scheme which was the scheme to which new UK employees had been admitted following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new members has been closed to further accrual from 1 January 2006.
It has been replaced by a stakeholder arrangement and members of the 2002 Scheme and future new employees in the UK accrue future benefits on a defined contribution basis under the stakeholder scheme.
During 2009 the Group entered into arrangements that insured 55% of the retirement obligations relating to pensions in payment in the two main UK schemes.
The arrangements comprise assets and interest rate swaps combined with an insurance contract that provide for the full payment of the pensions in return for the actual investment return on a segregated portfolio of assets held by the pension funds at the inception of the arrangement.
The pension schemes continue to benefit from the assets held in the portfolio and retain the obligation to meet the insured pension obligations.
The assets and pension obligations are therefore not derecognised in the financial statements and an asset representing the recovery of the insured pension obligations and a liability to pay the investment return on the portfolio of assets to the insurer are recognised.
126 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS During 2010 changes were made to the benefit structure of three UK schemes.
Changes affected future accrual from 1 March 2010 onwards.
Accrual rates were reduced: the retirement age was increased: revaluation was subject to a cap of 2.5%: a cap was applied to the salary used for the defined benefit schemes and the schemes contracted back in to the State scheme.
Employees were entitled to join the Stakeholder Pension scheme for earnings above the cap.
For the two main UK defined benefit schemes, the level of contributions in 2012 were 94m 2011: 73m of which 70m 2011: 51m were additional contributions in line with the plan to reduce their funding deficits.
Expected contributions to the two schemes for the year ending 31 December 2013 are approximately 44m including 30m of additional contributions to reduce the deficit.
Further additional contributions may become due once the results of the March 2012 funding valuations are known results expected in 2013.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain current and retired Canadian employees.
The benefits are not prefunded.
Life insurance benefits, which provide varying levels of coverage, are provided at no cost to retirees.
Healthcare benefits, which also provide varying levels of coverage, require retiree contributions in certain instances.
Benefits are generally payable for life.

The expected return on schemes assets are determined for each asset class by considering both market conditions at the beginning of the reporting period and any expectations for longer term changes in current returns.
All returns are net of investment expenses.
130 | RSA | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Mortality rate The mortality assumptions are set following investigations of the main schemes recent experience by the schemes actuaries for the funding valuations.
At the funding valuation in March 2009, the mortality assumptions adopted for the main UK schemes used the SAPS Light Normal base table with percentage adjustments to reflect the schemes recent experience compared with that expected under these tables.
The next funding valuation has an effective date of March 2012, with results expected in 2013.
Reductions in future mortality rates are allowed for by using 80% males and 60% females of the long cohort improvements.
The weighted average assumptions imply that a current pensioner aged 60 has an expected future lifetime of 27.6 2011: 27.5 years males and 28.2 2011: 28.1 years females and a future pensioner aged 60 in 15 years time has a future expected lifetime from age 60 of 28.3 2011: 28.3 years males and 28.7 2011: 28.7 years females.
Commutation Each of the UK defined benefit pension schemes has changed its rules to allow for increased commutation following A day in April 2006.
In 2011 and 2012, the Group followed the 2009 funding valuation assumptions, and an allowance was made for future commutation using the current commutation factors.
Sensitivity analysis The discount rate, the assumed inflation rate and the mortality assumptions all have a significant effect on the IAS 19 accounting valuation.
A 0.1% increase in the discount rate would reduce the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 63m 2011: 55m.
A 0.1% increase in the inflation rate assumption would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by 47m 2011: 51m.
An increase of one year in life expectancy would increase the defined benefit obligations in the UK not covered by the insurance arrangement by approximately 97m 2011: 84m.
The Group has no material exposure to the effect of changes in medical costs.
Impact of adoption of the revised IAS 19 in the 2013 financial statements The Group will adopt the revised version of IAS 19 Employment Benefits at 1 January 2013.
The changes to IAS 19 are described in the Significant Accounting Policies.
In 2012, the impact of the changes to IAS 19 for the main UK schemes is to increase the charge recognised in the income statement by 28m 22m net of taxes.
There is a corresponding reduction in the actuarial losses recognised in other comprehensive income.
There is no impact on the net asset value of the Group.
SHARE BASED COMPENSATION The Group has four types of share based payment plans which are settled in the form of ordinary shares: the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Sharesave Plan SAYE, the Sharebuild Plan and the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS.
Dilution levels for all schemes are held strictly within Association of British Insurers limits.
Further information on the LTIP scheme is included below and information on the other share schemes can be found in the remuneration report.
The total employment cost recorded in the income statement for all plans is 6m in 2012 2011: 9m.

Awards have been made each year since 2006 following shareholder approval.
The structure of the plan allows for a number of different types of awards to be made.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are purchased by participants from net bonus payable limited to a maximum value of 33% of net bonus : in addition, for senior executives, the Remuneration Committee may defer a portion of an individuals gross bonus limited to 33% of that bonus into an award over shares referred to for the purpose of the plan as Compulsory Deferred Shares.
Voluntary Deferred Shares are held in trust for three years.
Compulsory Deferred Shares awards are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
No further performance conditions apply.
The Remuneration Committee may make a conditional award of shares on a matched basis to Voluntary and Compulsory Deferred Shares Matching Shares up to a maximum of 2:1 and these are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee may make conditional awards of Performance Shares to senior executives and conditional awards of Restricted Shares to other executives and senior managers.
Awards of Performance Shares and Matching Shares related to Compulsory Deferred Shares are subject to a performance condition consisting of a combination of a return on equity target and a total shareholder return target with performance measured by comparison against other European insurance companies over a single three year performance period.
Matching Shares related to Voluntary Deferred Shares are subject only to the return on equity performance condition.
Restricted Shares are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant to the extent that the performance conditions have been met.
Performance Shares and Restricted Shares are normally forfeited on an employee leaving the Group.
Further information on the LTIP can be found in the remuneration report within the corporate governance section.
Further disclosures in respect of the SAYE and Sharebuild schemes have not been made on the grounds that the schemes are immaterial to the Group.
HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group designates certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options as hedging instruments against the net investment in designated subsidiaries to reduce the foreign exchange risk exposure.
For forward foreign exchange contracts, on designation, the interest element is separated from the forward exchange rate and is excluded from the hedge relationship.
Effectiveness of the hedge is then measured using the spot rate, which is also the exchange rate used when measuring the net investment in the designated subsidiaries.
For foreign exchange options the hedge designation is to hedge the value of the foreign operations at the strike price at the exercise date of the option.
The fair value of the hedging instruments at 31 December 2012 are a liability of 6m 2011: 12m and an asset of 14m 2011: 14m.
The hedge ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement during 2012 is nil 2011: nil.
Further information on derivatives, including those designated as hedging instruments, can be found in the risk management section.
