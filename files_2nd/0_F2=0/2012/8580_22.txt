Under defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has no further obligations to employees.
The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather than the Group.
It is the members responsibility to make investment decisions relating to their retirement benefits.
In a defined benefit scheme, members receive cash payments at and in retirement, the value of which is dependent on factors such as salary and length of service.
The Group underwrites investment, mortality and inflation risks necessary to meet these obligations.
In the event of poor returns the Group needs to address this through a combination of increased levels of contribution or by making adjustments to the schemes.
Schemes can be funded, where regular cash contributions are made by the employer into a fund which is invested, or unfunded, where no regular money or assets are required to be put aside to cover future payments.
The Group makes contributions to the ITV Pension Scheme, a separate trustee-administered fund that is not consolidated in these financial statements, but is reflected on the defined benefit pension deficit line on the statement of financial position.
It is the responsibility of the Trustee to manage and invest the assets of the schemes.
The Trustee is required to act in the best interest of the members.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes documentation.
In the unfunded scheme the Group is responsible for meeting pension obligations as they fall due.

Total defined benefit scheme obligations Keeping it simple...
The defined benefit obligation the pension scheme liabilities may change due to the following: F Current service cost credit changes in the present value of the obligation attributable to the members service in the current period.
This is charged to operating costs in the income statement.
F Curtailment losses gains these occur when the Company is demonstrably committed to amend a scheme so that the benegts for future services are reduced or eliminated.
A change in future benegts is treated as a curtailment and recognised in operating costs in the income statement rather than an actuarial gain or loss recognised in equity, if the effect of the remeasurement is signigcant.
F Past service costs credits these occur when there is a change in the present value of the obligation, in respect of a members prior period of service.
These can arise due to changes in the benegt entitlement of members and are recognised through operating costs.
F Settlement gains these occur when the Company enters into a transaction to eliminate all further legal or constructive obligations for some or all of the benegts provided by the schemes.
Settlement gains can arise from enhanced transfer values exercises, fully insuring benegts or on business disposals.
F Increase due to interest cost this is the unwinding of the discount on the present value of the obligation.
Broadly, it is determined by multiplying the discount rate at the beginning of the period by the present value of the obligation during the period.
This is recognised through net gnancing costs in the income statement.
F Actuarial losses gains arise from differences between the actual and expected outcome in the valuation of the obligation.
These can be experience adjustments, which are differences between the assumptions made and what actually occurred, or they can result from changes in assumptions.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through retained losses within equity.
F Cash contributions benegts paid cash contributions by scheme participants will increase the obligations by the schemes whereas any benefits paid out by the schemes will lower the obligations of those schemes.

com Stock code: ITV Total defined benefit scheme assets Keeping it simple...
The Pension scheme holds assets across a number of different classes, these being equities, bonds and other investments.
These assets are managed by the Trustee, although the Trustee is required to consult with the Group on changes to their investment policy.
Financial instruments are in place which provide protection against changes in market factors interest rates and inflation which could act to increase the pension deficit.
In 2011 the scheme obtained protection against the effect of increases in the life expectation of the majority of pensioner members by transacting a longevity swap.
Under the swap, the trustees of the scheme agreed to make predetermined payments in return for payments to meet the specified pension obligations as they fall due, irrespective of how long the members and their dependants live.
The difference in the present values of these two streams of payments is reflected in scheme assets and emerges as an actuarial loss on the assets.
The life expectancy assumptions which the Group makes for its IAS 19 calculations are its best estimate of the potential outcome.
The pre-determined swap payments from the Trustee of the scheme are based on a cautious estimate of life expectancy as they are being guaranteed.
This means that the asset adjustment in respect of the longevity swap increases when the discount rate decreases or when the inflation assumption increases and vice-versa.
Pension scheme assets are measured at their fair value and can change due to the following: F The expected return on scheme assets is determined based on the market expectations at the beginning of the year and calculated as the expected percentage return multiplied by the fair value of the scheme assets.
This expected return on scheme assets is recognised through net gnancing costs in the income statement.
F Actuarial gains and losses arise from differences between the actual and expected outcome in the valuation of the assets.
For example, differences in the actual asset performance versus the expected performance would be an actuarial gain loss.
F Employers contributions and cash contributions by scheme participants are paid into the schemes to be managed and invested.

This section outlines how the Group manages its capital and related financing costs.
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of ITV, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders equity and how much is borrowed from financial institutions debt in order to finance the Groups activities both now and in the future.
The Directors consider the Groups capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern and deliver its business plan.
The Boards focus during the year was on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet through a bond tender, and improving the Groups credit rating.
In 2013 the Board will further review its policies on capital structure to support the Transformation Plan, any potential courses of action will take into account the Groups liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in the business, pension deficit initiatives and impact on credit ratings.
The Board is mindful that equity capital cannot be easily flexed and in particular raising new equity would normally be likely only in the context of an acquisition.
Debt can be issued and repurchased more easily but there are high transaction costs in frequent adjustment and debt holders are under no obligation to accept any offer to repurchase.
4.1 Net cash debt Keeping it simple... Net cash debt is the Groups key measure used to evaluate total outstanding debt net of the current cash resources.
In degning total outstanding debt the Directors consider it appropriate to include the following: F the currency impact of swaps held against those debt instruments: F equity components of debt instruments: and F the amortised cost adjustment which rehects the increase in coupon rates for specigc bonds caused by the downgrade of ITVs credit status to sub-investment grade in August 2008.

4.3 Derivative gnancial instruments Keeping it simple... A derivative is a financial instrument used to manage risk.
Its value changes over time in response to underlying variables such as exchange rates or interest rates and is for a fixed period.
In accordance with Board approved policies, the Group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest on its borrowings and foreign exchange rates.
These policies are included within Section 4.5.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised as either assets or liabilities at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
Movements in instruments measured at fair value are recorded in the income statement in net financing costs.
Analysis of these derivatives and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values is detailed in this section.
Accounting policies Third party valuations are used to fair value the Groups The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial derivatives.
The valuation techniques use inputs such instruments to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in interest as interest rate yield curves and currency prices yields, and foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not hold or issue volatilities of underlying instruments and correlations derivative instruments for speculative purposes and does between inputs.

4.6 Fair value hierarchy Keeping it simple...
The financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position are measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective, and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations.
ITV generally uses external valuations using market inputs or market values e. g. external share prices and does not calculate its own fair values.
The different valuation methods are called hierarchies and are described below.
The table below sets out the financial instruments included on the ITV statement of financial position at fair value.
