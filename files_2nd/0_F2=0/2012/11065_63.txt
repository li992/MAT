Impairment During 2012, due to continuing volatility in the commodity markets, the Group estimated the recoverable amount of its Cash Generating Units CGUs using a value in use ViU based on the most recent financial budget as approved by the Board, from mid-term five year plans and on the projected life of the Groups mines and coking facilities.
The recoverable value of the Groups assets was estimated to be higher than the carrying value of the associated assets and accordingly no impairment charge has been recognised.
Management have identified two key assumptions used in the calculation of recoverable amount for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount.
These key assumptions are the discount rate and changes in the forecast coal and coke sales prices.
The estimated value in use was determined using a post-tax discount rate of 10.10% equivalent of pre-tax discount rates between 11.66% and 12.22% for various CGUs and sales prices were derived from the median of a range of mid-term publically available market data.
In 2005, an impairment was recognised on certain property, plant and equipment assets of the Group.
Following a review in the fourth quarter of 2012, management determined that this impairment should not have been recorded.
As the effect is not material to the financial statements of any prior period, this has been corrected in the current period and the 2012 income statement includes a credit of EUR 7,438 thousand in order to include the related assets at their appropriate carrying value.
Debiensko Project Property, plant and equipment includes EUR 13,967 thousand of exploration and evaluation costs related to the Debiensko Project.
As exploration and evaluation is ongoing, exploration rights are not due to expire and the Directors consider that the Project has identified commercially viable quantities of coal resources, the capitalised cost of the projects have not been subject to an impairment test as required by IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
