The issue price represented a discount of 49% to the closing price of 256.1 pence per existing ordinary share on 26 April 2012, the announcement date of the rights issue.
28 Share option schemes and share based payment Performance Share Plan The Company has an equity-settled share option scheme for employees called the Salamander Energy Performance Share Plan PSP.
Further details of the PSP are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Awards under the PSP may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
In any ten year period, the Company may not issue or have the possibility to issue more than 10% of the issued capital of the Company pursuant to awards granted under the PSP and any other rights granted under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Shares held in treasury will count as new issue shares for the purposes of the above limits unless institutional bodies decide that they need not count.
Shares purchased in the market will not, however, count towards the limit described above.

The adjusted numbers are quoted in the table above.
The expense recognised for unvested employee share options of $3,726,000 2011: $3,654,000 relates wholly to equity-settled share based payment arising from grants made under the PSP.
Of this amount, $492,000 2011: $801,000 was capitalised as being directly attributable to capital and other projects.
At 31 December 2012, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $3,031,000 2011: 3,072,000, which is expected to be recognised over the following three years.
The weighted average market price of shares at the date of exercise was 1.79.
Outstanding share options at 31 December 2012 will vest between 2013 and 2014 subject to the vesting criteria.
110 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 28 Share option schemes and share based payment continued Performance Share Plan continued The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year, as estimated at the date of grant, was 1.02 per share 2011: 2.27.
This was calculated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model based on the following assumptions: 2012 2011 Weighted average share price at date of grant 1.63 3.10 Exercise price 0.10 0.10 Expected volatility 39% 65% Expected life 3 years 3 years Expected dividend 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 0.42% 1.64% There is a 12 month window for exercise.
However, as the exercise price is nominal it is assumed that recipients exercise at the end of the performance period.
Therefore an expected life of three years after the date of grant has been assumed.
Deferred Equity Plan The Company also has another equity-settled share option scheme for employees called the Salamander Energy Deferred Equity Plan DEP.
The DEP follows a similar principle to the PSP scheme, but removes the requirement of a comparator group with shares settled after a period of two years by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
Movement in DEP shares during the year was as follows: 2012 2011 Shares Weighted Shares Weighted under option average price under option average price number s number s 1 Outstanding at 1 January 772,617 0.10 239,457 0.10 Granted during the year 1,347,163 0.10 533,160 0.10 Exercised during the year 215,119 0.10 0.10 Lapsed during the year 170,149 0.10 0.10 Outstanding at 31 December 1,734,512 0.10 772,617 0.10 Exercisable at 31 December 54,407 1 The number of shares subject to the Share Award was adjusted by increasing the original Share Award by 24.1% to reect the rights issue which took place in April 2012.

At 31 December 2012, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $2,197,000, which is expected to be recognised over the following two years.
The weighted average market price of shares at the date of exercise was 1.77.
