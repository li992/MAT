This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level, using the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data level 3 The fair value of the interest-rate swaps of 66.0 million is considered to be level 2.
All other financial assets and liabilities are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
