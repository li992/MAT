SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS During the period there were three classes of equity-settled employee share incentive plans outstanding: a Save As You Earn SAYE.
Under this scheme employees enter into a savings contract for a period of three to seven years and options are granted on commencement of the contract, exercisable using the amount saved under the contract at the time it terminates.
Options under the scheme are granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of the shares at the time of the invitation and are not subject to performance conditions.
Exercise of options is subject to continued employment.
b Executive Share Option Plan ESOP.
Under this scheme executive share options are awarded at the prevailing market rate on the date of the grant.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years after grant and upon the achievement of performance criteria in relation to earnings per share.
c Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under this scheme nil cost options are granted that will only vest provided the participant satisfies the minimum shareholding requirement and performance conditions relating to earnings per share, as set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 42, are met.
In 2010, HM Revenue & Customs HMRC approved an Approved Performance Share Plan APSP to enable participants in the LTIP to benefit from UK tax efficiencies.
As such, awards made in 2010 and future years comprise an HMRC approved option in respect of the first 30,000 worth of an award and an unapproved LTIP award for amounts in excess of this HMRC limit.
A further share award a linked award is also provided to enable participants to fund the exercise of the approved option.
This linked award is satisfied by way of shares from the Companys Employee benefit Trust but these additional shares are not delivered to the participant.
Under these rules the LTIP options are still issued at nil cost to the employee.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED In 2011, a minor amendment was made to the APSP to allow approved options to be granted in parallel to those approved options granted to the participants in 2010.
A participant will only be able to exercise the approved option granted to him in 2011 if the approved option granted to him in 2010 has lapsed or been released.
If the participant exercises the approved option granted to him in 2010, the approved option granted to him in 2011 shall lapse.
The tables below summarise the outstanding share options.

The fair values of the SAYE, ESOP and LTIP rights are calculated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The significant inputs into the model for all schemes unless otherwise stated were: 2012 2011 Dividend yield % 6.4 5.8 Expected volatility % 32.9 to 45.5 40.0 to 52.2 Risk free interest rate % 0.4 to 1.3 1.2 to 2.8 Expected life of rights SAYE 3 to 7 years 3 to 7 years ESOP 3 years 3 years LTIP 3 years 3 years The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the expected life of the rights.
The performance criteria of the ESOP and LTIP, as set out previously, are built into the pricing model.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the SAYE was 14.5p 2011: 18.5p.
The fair value of options granted during the period in relation to the LTIP was 80.9p 2011: 82.8p.
The weighted average share price for options exercised over the period was 111.5p 2011: 103.3p.
The total charge for the period relating to employee share-based payment plans was 0.2 million 2011: 0.3 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After tax, the total charge was 0.1 million 2011: 0.2 million.
