The additional accounting policies that are specific to the separate financial statements of the Company are set out below.
Investment in subsidiaries The Company accounts for its investments in directly owned subsidiaries as available for sale financial assets, which are included in the accounts at fair value.
Changes in the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are recognised directly in equity in the statement of comprehensive income.

INVESTMENTS CONTINUED The investments in subsidiaries are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value measured in accordance with the Companys accounting policies.
The Companys investments are classified as Level 2 financial assets.
Fair value of the Companys significant subsidiary is determined by reference to the market value derived from relevant indices of the Companys ordinary shares and loan capital instruments at the end of the reporting period, being the most transparent independent available indicator.
The market value is adjusted for the fair value of the Companys preference shares, assets and liabilities, excluding directly owned subsidiaries.
The adjusting items have been fair valued by determining the present value of future cashflow projections, using an appropriate arms length discount rate.
The remaining subsidiaries are held at fair value which has been determined to be net asset value.
The Directors believe that the methodology used supports the inclusion of the investments in subsidiaries in the statement of financial position, at the fair values ascribed to them.
The market value of the Companys ordinary shares at 31 December 2012 was 125.7p.
A movement of 1% in the share price would have an impact of 45m on the fair value.
