The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 6.0m 2011: 5.2m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the Groups financial statements according to IAS 19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The schemes are closed to new entrants, however, eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of the Wilts & Dorset Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan is 0.1m 2011: 0.1m being the contributions paid and payable.
During the year, the Wilts and Dorset Pension Scheme and the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan merged into the Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan, which remains structured as a pooled arrangement, with no sectionalisation of the assets and liabilities attributable to the transferring schemes.
Members of the transferring schemes were provided the same benefits for past and future service in the Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan as they had previously been entitled to.
Other pension plans A defined benefit plan exists for a small number of employees who transferred from East Thames Buses, which was transferred to the Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan on 1 October 2011.
Some employees of Plymouth Citybus have entitlement to a Devon County Council defined benefit plan.
Both schemes are externally funded.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Both schemes are now closed to new entrants.

The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.
The table below shows the life expectancy assumptions used in the accounting assessments based on the life expectancy of a male member of each pension scheme at age 65.
2012 2011 Years Years Pensioner 19 19 Non-pensioner 20 20 The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes i. e. equities and bonds.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets suggested by the yields available, and the views of investment organisations.
Sensitivity analysis In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used.
For non-rail pension schemes, the following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions.
In isolation the following adjustments would adjust the pension deficit and cost as shown.
2012 Pension deficit Pension cost m m Discount factor increase of 0.1% 10.1 0.1 Price inflation increase of 0.1% 9.0 0.1 Rate of increase in salaries increase of 0.1% 2.1 0.2 Rate of increase of pensions in payment increase of 0.1% 5.6 0.3 Increase in life expectancy of pensioners or non-pensioners by 1 year 18.3 1.2 A triennial valuation of the Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan is currently underway and, whilst the Group and Pension Trustees are still considering the results of the valuation, it is likely that the life expectancy for pensioners and non-pensioners will increase by one to two years thereby increasing the scheme deficit by approximately 30m in respect of this assumption alone.

The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
BRASS matching AVC company contributions of 0.8m 2011: 0.9m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.

The discount rate is based on the anticipated return of AA rated corporate bonds with a term matching the maturity of the scheme liabilities.
The mortality assumptions adopted as at 30 June 2012 have been updated based on the December 2010 valuation.
This includes different assumptions for different subsections of each Schemes membership.
Factors used to differentiate between members include level of pension in payment, pensionable pay and member postcodes.
These factors were used as they have been shown to impact upon life expectancy.
The mortality tables used were the S1 SAPS tables, published by the CMI on 31 October 2008.
As such different members will have different life expectancies dependant on their characteristics and it is not possible to quote a single life expectancy figure.
The expected return on assets has been derived as the weighted average of the expected returns from each of the main asset classes i. e. equities and bonds.

Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the Groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.
If the Group had accounted for the rail schemes in accordance with the full provisions of IAS 19 the following adjustments would have been made to the financial statements: 2012 2011 m m Balance sheet Defined benefit pension plan 237.3 193.7 Deferred tax asset 54.7 46.9 Intangible asset 9.5 13.3 173.1 133.5 Other comprehensive income Actuarial gains losses 32.7 161.5 Tax on actuarial gains losses 7.8 42.0 24.9 119.5 Income statement Operating costs franchise adjustment 10.8 17.8 Intangible asset amortisation 3.8 3.9 Deferred tax charge 1.7 3.6 5.3 10.3 IAS 19 disclosures All of the above plans have been accounted for under IAS 19 covering employee benefits.
