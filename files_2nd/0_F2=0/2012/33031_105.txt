To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value.
Rhine FVC The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Rhine FVC is most sensitive are refinery gross margins, throughput volumes and discount rate.
Gross margin assumptions used in the Rhine FVC plan are consistent with those used to develop the regional Refining Marker Margin RMM.
The average values assigned to the regional RMM and refinery throughput volume over the plan period are $12.30 per barrel and 246mmbbl per year 2011 $11.35 per barrel and 257mmbbl per year.
These values reflect past experience and are consistent with external sources.
Cash flows beyond the five-year plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 4% growth rate 2011 cash flows beyond the five-year plan period were extrapolated using a nominal 4% growth rate.
2012 Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity of value in use to a change in refinery margins of $1 per barrel $ billion 1.5 Adverse change in refinery margins to reduce recoverable amount to carrying amount $ per barrel 1.4 Sensitivity of value in use to a 5% change in production volume $ billion 0.9 Adverse change in throughput volume to reduce recoverable amount to carrying amount million barrels per year 30 Sensitivity of value in use to a change in the discount rate of 1% $ billion 0.6 Discount rate to reduce recoverable amount to carrying amount 16% Lubricants As permitted by IAS 36, the detailed calculations of the Lubricants units recoverable amount performed in the most recent detailed calculation in 2009 were used for the 2012 impairment test as the criteria in that standard were considered satisfied: the headroom was substantial in 2009: there have been no significant changes in the assets and liabilities: and the likelihood that the recoverable amount would be less than the carrying amount at the time was remote.
The key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Lubricants unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes and discount rate.
The values assigned to these key assumptions reflect past experience.
No reasonably possible changes in any of these key assumptions would cause the units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
Cash flows beyond the two-year plan period were extrapolated using a nominal 3% growth rate.
