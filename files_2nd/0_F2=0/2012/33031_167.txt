Presentation of the financial statements These summarized financial statements represent an abridged version of the financial statements in BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012, which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and IFRS as adopted for use by the European Union EU.
IFRS as adopted for use by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB: however, the differences have no impact on the groups consolidated financial statements for the years presented.
Significant event Gulf of Mexico oil spill As a consequence of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP continues to incur costs and has also recognized liabilities for future costs.
The information presented in this note should be read in conjunction with BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Financial statements, Note 2, Note 36 and Note 43.
The group income statement includes a pre-tax charge of $5.0 billion for 2012 in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
This charge includes $3.85 billion for the discounted cost of the agreement with the US government to settle all federal criminal charges, adjustments to provisions and the ongoing costs of the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO.
The cumulative pre-tax income statement charge since the incident amounts to $42.2 billion.
The cumulative income statement charge does not include amounts for obligations that BP considers are not possible, at this time, to measure reliably, namely any obligation in relation to Natural Resource Damages claims under the Oil Pollution Act 1990 other than the estimated costs of the assessment phase and the costs of early restoration agreements.
It is also not possible to measure reliably any obligation in relation to any additional liability in relation to business economic loss claims under the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC settlement not yet received or processed by the Deepwater Horizon Court Supervised Settlement Program, or any other potential litigation including through excluded parties from the PSC settlement and any obligation in relation to other potential private or governmental litigation, fines, or penalties except for those in relation to the Clean Water Act.
See page 18 for further information.
A full understanding of BPs provisioning, uncertainties and contingencies relating to the PSC settlement cannot be achieved without reading BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Financial statements, Note 36 and Note 43.
The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP in relation to all the obligations relating to the incident are subject to significant uncertainty and the ultimate exposure and cost to BP will be dependent on many factors, as discussed in BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Financial statements, Note 43, Contingent liabilities, including in relation to any new information or future developments.
Furthermore, significant uncertainty exists in relation to the amount of claims that will become payable by BP, the amount of fines that will ultimately be levied on BP including any determination of BPs culpability based on any findings of negligence, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the outcome of litigation and arbitration proceedings, and any costs arising from any longer-term environmental consequences of the oil spill, which will also impact upon the ultimate cost for BP.
The amount and timing of any amounts payable could also be impacted by any further settlements which may or may not occur.
These could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The risks associated with the incident could also heighten the impact of the other risks to which the group is exposed as further described in BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2012 Risk factors.
