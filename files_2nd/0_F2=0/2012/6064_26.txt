Overview Performance Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information FirstGroup plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is 395 King Street, Aberdeen AB24 5RP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the operating and financial review onpages 22 to 38.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2.
The parent Company financial statements and notes thereto are shown separately under UK GAAP on pages 114 to 122.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria of IFRSs adopted and endorsed for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as described in the going concern statement in the Directors report on page 60.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set outbelow.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2012 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31 March 2012 and the results of all the other businesses for the 53 weeks ended 31 March 2012.
The figures for the year to 31 March 2011 include the results of the rail businesses for the year to 31March 2011 and the results of all the other businesses for the 52 weeks ended 26 March 2011.
Restatement of prior years numbers The income statement and segmental amounts for the year to 31 March 2011 have been restated to show the results of FirstGroup Deutschland GmbH, which was sold during the year, within discontinued operations.
The results of discontinued operations are set out in note 10.
The calculation of adjusted EBITDA has been revised to exclude capital grant amortisation whereas previously EBITDA was calculated as adjusted operating profit plus depreciation.
As a result of this EBITDA for the year to 31 March 2011 has been restated as follows: m EBITDA as previously stated 778.2 Discontinued operations 1.3 Capital grant amortisation 8.0 EBITDA as restated 768.9 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Noncontrolling interest consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation, and is able to make an additional investment, to cover the losses.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by theGroup.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 67 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
Asa general rule, significant influence will be presumed to exist when the Group holds, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, 20% or more of the voting power, of the investee.
However, where it is clear that the Group, although holding 20% or more of the voting power does not have significant influence, the investment is not accounted for as an associate.
The Group has a 30% holding in DSBFirst but does not have significant influence and therefore the holding is treated as an investment.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Assets held for sale Assets held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year of the date of classification.
Goodwill and intangible assets Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units CGUs.
CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount ofthe CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment loss is allocated to the goodwill of the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
The existing finite life intangible assets have a residual value of nil and are amortised over their useful economic lives as follows: Customer contracts over the life of the contract 9 to 20 years Greyhound brand and trade name over the life of the brand 20 years Franchise agreements over the term of the franchise 6 to 10 years Revenue recognition Revenue principally comprises revenue from train passenger services, road passenger transport, and certain management and maintenance services inthe UK and North America.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales taxes.
Revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the customers travel or services provided under contractual arrangements as the proportion of total services to be provided.
Receipts for season tickets and travel cards are deferred within accruals and deferred income and recognised in the income statement over the period covered by the relevant ticket.
Revenue in UK Rail includes franchise subsidy receipts from the Department for Transport DfT and Transport Scotland and amounts receivable under franchise revenue support arrangements.
Franchise premium payments to the DfT for amounts due under the terms of a franchise are included in operating costs.
Revenue also includes amounts attributable to the Train Operating Companies TOCs, predominantly based on models of route usage, by the Railway Settlement Plan in respect of passenger receipts.
UK Bus revenue principally comprises amounts receivable from ticket sales and concessionary fare schemes.
Concessionary amounts are recognised in the period in which the service is provided based on a predetermined formula as agreed with the relevant local authority.
Greyhound coach revenue mainly comprises of amounts receivable from ticket sales.
Other Bus, including First Student and First Transit, and services revenue from contracts with government bodies and similar organisations is recognised as the services are provided.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Allother leases are classified as operating leases and the rental charges are charged against income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
68 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than pounds Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group holds currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies see note 25 for details of the Groups policies in respect of foreign exchange risks.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at the closing exchange rates on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising from the average or actual exchange rates used and the period end rate, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after amortisation charges and exceptional items but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items of income or expenditure which due to their size, nature and or infrequency, require separate identification on the face of the income statement to allow a better understanding of the financial performance in the year, in comparison to prior years.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes, which include both defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
There is no legal or constructive obligation to pay additional contributions into a defined contribution scheme if the fund has insufficient assets to pay all employees benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial updates being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit position recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
Various TOCs in the UK Rail business participate in the Railways Pension Scheme, which is an industry-wide defined benefit scheme.
The Group is obligated to fund the relevant section of the scheme over the period for which the franchise is held.
The full liability is recognised on the balance sheet, which is then reduced by a franchise adjustment so that the net liability reflects the Groups obligations to fund the scheme over the franchise term.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill, or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Properties for provision of services or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Passenger carrying vehicles and other plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write-off the cost of assets, other than freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Capital grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately except in the case of goodwill, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
70 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets The Group measures financial assets on initial recognition at fair value, and determines the classification of such assets at initial recognition and on any subsequent reclassification event.
Where there is no active market for a financial asset, fair value is determined using valuation techniques including recent commercial transactions and discounted cash flows.
Otherwise financial assets are carried at amortised cost.
Financial assets are classified into one of four primary categories: Fair value through profit and loss This covers any financial asset designated on initial recognition to be measured at fair value with fair value changes to go through profit and loss, and financial assets acquired principally for the purpose of trading in the short term.
Held to maturity investments Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified here when the Group has the intention and ability to hold to maturity.
These financial assets are held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
Loans and receivables Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market have not been designated as either fair value through profit or loss or available for sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired as well as through amortisation.
The most significant financial assets under this category are trade receivables and bank deposits.
Trade receivables are measured at fair value, i. e. original invoice amount, less an allowance for uncollectable amounts.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Bank deposits are included within cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents as defined for the cash flow statement comprise cash in hand, cash held at bank with immediate access, other short term investments and bank deposits with maturities of three months or less from the date of inception and bank overdrafts.
In the consolidated balance sheet cash and cash equivalents exclude bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts that have no legal right of set-off against cash and cash equivalents are included within borrowings in current liabilities.
All are carried on the balance sheet at cost.
Cash and cash equivalents includes ring-fenced cash.
The most significant ring-fenced cash balances are held by the Groups UK Rail subsidiaries.
Under the terms of the Rail franchise agreements, cash can only be distributed by the train operating companies up to the lower of the amount of retained profits or the amount determined by prescribed liquidity ratios.
The ring-fenced cash represents that which is not available for distribution or theamount required to satisfy the contractual liquidity ratio at the balance sheet date.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified in any of the other categories.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Sterling bonds and loan notes These are measured either on an amortised cost basis or at fair value, if adopted.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks, foreign currency risks and fuel price risks.
Use of such financial instrumentsis governed by policies and delegated authorities approved by the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The main derivative financial instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps, fuel swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps.
Such instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at the reported balance sheet date.
The fair values are calculated by reference to market exchange rates, interest rates and fuel prices at the period end, and supported by counterparty confirmations.
The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for interest rate risk on certain floating rate debt, and fair value hedges for fair value risk relating to the LIBOR element of a fixed rate financial liability.
The fuel swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of fuel price risks or otherwise used as economic hedges of such risks.
The cross currency swaps are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk relating to part of the Groups net investment in US Dollar assets.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges or foreign currency hedges of aforeign net investment are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
Ifahedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for theperiod.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics arenot closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Amounts due within 12 months of the balance sheet date are considered to be reliably measured and are therefore included within accruals and deferred income.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made under IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets for the estimated cost of settling uninsured claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and is adjusted for the effects of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
New standards and interpretations not applied The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations for annual periods beginning on or after the effective dates as noted below: Effective for accounting periods IAS IFRS standards starting on or after Amendments to IFRS 1 March 2012 Government Loans 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 32 December 2011 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2014 Amendments to IFRS 7 December 2011 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 1 January 2013 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2015 Amendments to IAS 1 June 2011 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 IAS 19 revised June 2011 Employee Benefits 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IAS 28 revised May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures 1 January 2013 IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements 1 January 2013 72 FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Performance Governance Financial statements 2.
Significant accounting policies continued The key impact of IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits will be to remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities and replace them with one single discount rate for the net deficit.
With the exception of the revisions to IAS 19 noted above, the Directors do not anticipate the adoption of these other standards will have a material impact on the Groups accounts in the period of initial application.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies which are described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of intangible assets including goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGU and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 1,599.3m 2011: 1,608.0m: 2010: 1,754.9m as set out in note 13 and the carrying amount of other intangible assets at the balance sheet date was 318.8m 2011: 348.6m: 2010: 415.9m as set out in note 14.
The sensitivities on the key assumptions used in the goodwill impairment testing are also set out in note 13.
Contract and franchise accounting Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regards to the recoverability of amounts due and the carrying value of related assets and liabilities arising from long term service contracts and franchises.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcome of these types of contracts and franchises, which require assessments and judgements relating to the expected level of revenues and costs and, in cases where options exist, the life of the contract or franchise.
Defined benefit pension arrangements Measurement of defined benefit pension obligations requires estimation of a suitable discount rate, the expected return on scheme assets, expected rate of inflation of future salary and pension costs along with assumptions about mortality rates.
The most significant of these are the discount rate and inflation rate assumptions.
A 0.1% movement in the discount rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 1m and 25m respectively.
A 0.1% movement in the inflation rate would impact operating profit and the balance sheet position by approximately 3m and 18m respectively.
The net pension deficit as at the balance sheet date was 267.9m 2011: 243.2m: 2010: 330.8m as set out in note 36.
Self-insurance Provision is made for all known incidents for which there is self-insurance using managements best estimate of the likely settlement of these incidents.
The estimated settlement is reviewed on a regular basis with independent actuarial advice and the amount provided is adjusted as required.
The Groups total self-insurance provisions, including those classified within accruals and deferred income, as at the balance sheet date were 336.0m 2011: 340.5m: 2010: 375.2m as set out in note 27.

Exceptional items and amortisation charges continued UK Bus Pension Scheme changes During the year we took actions to fide-risk the UK Bus Pension Scheme, the most significant of which is that pension increases will be linked to consumer price inflation CPI rather than retail price inflation RPI.
In addition a pensionable pay cap was introduced along with lower pension accrual rates.
As a result of these changes future pension liabilities have decreased and a one-off exceptional gain of 73.3m 2011: nil was realised.
UK Rail bid costs We are now entering a transition period for UK Rail with eight franchises being retendered in the next two years.
Bid costs of 10.2m 2011: 2.7m were incurred during the year.
These costs covered the preparation of the Intercity West Coast bid which was submitted on 4 May 2012.
They also include the cost of pre-qualification for three further rail franchises Great Western, Thameslink and Essex Thameside.
We are the only operator to pre-qualify for all the franchises that are currently out to bid.
UK Bus depot sales and closures As part of our programme to rebalance our portfolio in UK Bus operations we have taken the decision to sell or close certain operations.
Net losses of 8.2m were incurred during the year comprising 6.7m of operating losses for the year and 1.5m of closure costs.
In addition a loss on the disposal of the Northumberland Park depot in East London of 2.5m was recorded in the year representing gross proceeds of 14.2m less the carrying value of net assets including 5.2m of goodwill as well as transaction costs.
The proceeds of the disposal were received in the first week of 2012 13.
Competition Commission costs During the year we incurred a further 1.9m 2011: 1.4m of costs responding to and representing our position to the Competition Commission investigation into the UK Bus market.
The Competition Commission issued their final Report in December 2011.
Other exceptional items Costs of 1.1m were incurred principally on effecting the changes to the UK Bus Pension Scheme as described above.
Amortisation charges The charge for the year was 30.9m 2011: 42.9m with the reduction mainly due to the write off of the remaining balance of the First Great Western franchise intangible asset 7.6m in the previous year.
Profit loss on disposal of properties During the year we realised 40.3m 2011: 10.1m on the disposal of selected properties predominantly in Greyhound operations.
These resulted in a net profit on disposal of 1.0m 2011: loss of 4.4m.
Ineffectiveness on financial derivatives Due to the ineffective element and undesignated fair value movements on financial derivatives there was a 11.0m non-cash charge 2011: 0.3m credit to the income statement during the year.
The principal component of this non-cash charge relates to fixed interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting but do provide a cash flow hedge against variable rate debt from 2012 to 2015.
It is anticipated that the charge in respect of these swaps will reverse over their contractual term.
Tax on exceptional items and amortisation charges The tax credit as a result of these exceptional items was 0.4m 2011: 41.3m.
In addition there was a one-off deferred tax credit of 4.0m 2011: 1.7m as a result of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% 2011: 28% to 26%.

Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2012 2011 2010 m m m Carrying amount First Student 1,029.6 1,027.5 1,117.9 First Transit 247.3 246.7 271.1 Greyhound 227.4 226.9 244.3 UK Bus 89.4 95.2 95.5 UK Rail 5.6 5.6 19.8 Germany 6.1 6.3 1,599.3 1,608.0 1,754.9 Impairment testing At the year end, the carrying value of net assets, including goodwill, was reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Forthe purposes of this impairment review goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of discounted future cash flows arising in each relevantCGU.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budget for 2012 13 and Five Year Plan projections for 2013-16 which take account of both past performance and expectations for future market developments.
The projections for First Student assume the incremental benefits of the recovery plan together with a moderate economic recovery.
Cash flows in 2015 16 are extrapolated using estimated growth rates of 2.5% 2011: 2.5% for the United Kingdom and 3.0% 2011: 3.0% for North America which do not exceed the long term average growth rate for the Groups businesses.
A risk adjustment is then made using a pre-tax discount rate of 10.0% 2011: 10.0% to arrive at the value in use for each of the CGUs.
Thepre-tax discount rates applied are derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the Groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
The Directors consider the assumptions to be reasonable based on the historic performance of each CGU and to be realistic in light of economic and industry forecasts.
The calculation of value in use for each CGU is most sensitive to the principal assumptions of discount rate, growth rates and margins achievable.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the calculations and confirms that no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
The headroom by the principal CGUs and sensitivities thereon, which are shown on a mutually exclusive basis, are as follows: First First Student Transit Greyhound UK Bus UK Rail m m m m m 1 Carrying value 1,546 261 306 822 110 Headroom 241 420 345 512 546 Value in use 1,787 681 651 1,334 656 Headroom after increasing discount rate by 1.0% 71 353 279 381 479 Headroom after a 1.0% reduction in assumed growth rates 226 414 339 500 540 Headroom after a 1.0% reduction in margin 89 329 274 397 334 1 Net assets including goodwill above but excluding intercompany balances.
The First Student margin would need to fall in excess of 1.6% compared to future projections for there to be an impairment to the carrying value of net assets in this business.
Following their review of goodwill the Directors have concluded that there is no impairment to any of the CGUs.

The rail franchise agreements intangible asset represents the part of the economic benefit that is realised as a result of recognising our share of the rail pension deficit on the date of commencement of each respective franchise and is amortised on a straight-line basis over the initial term of each respective franchise.
The largest element of the franchise intangible relates to the First ScotRail franchise carrying amount 3.3m 2011: 4.6m.
During 2011 the Great Western franchise agreement intangible was fully written down as set out in note 5.

Credit risk exists in relation to the Groups financial assets, which comprise trade and other receivables of 601.9m 2011: 555.5m: 2010: 602.5m, cash and cash equivalents of 499.7m 2011: 388.0m: 2010: 335.0m and derivative financial instruments of 116.1m 2011: 123.2m: 2010: 65.1m.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for all financial assets at the balance sheet date was 1,217.7m 2011: 1,066.7m: 2010: 1,002.6m.
Theexposure is spread over a large number of unconnected counterparties and the maximum single concentration with any one counterparty was81.1m 2011: 53.0m: 2010: 50.0m at the balance sheet date.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Theprovision for doubtful receivables at the balance sheet date was 4.5m 2011: 7.5m: 2010: 6.5m.
Most trade receivables are with public or quasi public bodies, principally the UK Department for Transport, Network Rail, Transport for London, Transport Scotland, UK city councils and school bus boards and city municipal authorities in North America.
The Group does not consider any of these counterparties to be a significant risk.
Each division within the Group has a policy governing credit risk management on trade receivables.
The counterparties for bank balances and derivative financial instruments are mainly represented by large banks with a minimum of A credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
These counterparties are subject to approval by the Board.
Group treasury policy limits the maximum deposit with any one counterparty to 75m, and limits the maximum term to three months.

The Group manages these risks within the context of a set of formal policies established by the Board.
Certain risk management responsibilities are formally delegated by the Board, principally to a sub-committee of the Board and to the Group Finance Director.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group may encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
The objective of the Groups liquidity risk management is to ensure sufficient committed liquidity resources exist.
The Group has a diversified debt structure largely represented by medium term unsecured syndicated and bilateral committed bank facilities, medium to long term unsecured bond debt and finance leases.
It is a policy requirement that debt obligations must be addressed well in advance of their due dates.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 250m of committed liquidity headroom at all times within medium term bank facilities and such facilities must be renewed or replaced well before their expiry dates.
The next material contractual expiry of revolver bank facilities is in December 2015.
Largely due to the seasonality of the First Student school bus business, headroom tends to reduce from March to October and increase again by the following March.
The average duration of net debt excluding ring-fenced cash at 31 March 2012 was 5.5 years 2011: 6.1 years: 2010: 6.3 years.
The following tables detail the Groups expected maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The amounts in these tables are different to the balance sheet as the table is prepared on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
For all years above the tables include the settlement of principal amounts at the end of the term of the cross currency swaps.
No derivative financial instruments had collateral requirements or were due on demand in any of the years.
Currency risk Currency risk is the risk of financial loss to foreign currency net assets, earnings and cash flows reported in Sterling due to movements in exchangerates.
The Groups principal operations outside the UK are in the US and Canada, with the US being the most significant.
Consequently the principal currency risk relates to movements in the US Dollar to Sterling.
Group treasury policy requires a minimum of 30% foreign currency denominated net assets to be hedged.
As at 31 March 2012, 47% 2011: 62%: 2010: 63% of foreign currency denominated net assets were hedged with related foreign currency debt, debt and currency swaps.
Group treasury policy aims to protect EPS from currency movements.
US Dollar earnings arising in the US are substantially protected by US Dollar denominated costs incurred in the UK, principally UK fuel costs, US Dollar interest costs and US Dollar tax costs so that exposure to EPS on a year to year basis is not material.
Cash flow exposures are not material.
IFRS 7 requires the Group to show the impact on profit after tax and hedging reserve on financial instruments from a movement in exchange rates.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% strengthening in Sterling against the US Dollar.
The analysis has been prepared based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and being held constant throughout the reporting period.
A positive number indicates an increase in earnings or equity where Sterling strengthens against the US Dollar.
2012 2011 2010 m m m Impact on profit after tax 9.9 9.9 15.7 Impact on hedging reserve 0.4 0.5 13.1 Interest rate risk The Group has variable rate debt and cash and therefore its net income is exposed to the effects of changes to interest rates.
The Group treasury policy objective is to maintain fixed interest rates at a minimum average of 75% of on-balance sheet net debt over the medium term, so that volatility issubstantially reduced year on year to EPS.
The main floating rate benchmarks on variable rate debt are US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
The policy objective is achieved through fixed rate debt and cash flow hedge financial instruments, being interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps cover periods from April 2012 to March 2015.
This fixed rate protection had an average duration of 5.7 years 2011: 6.7 years: 2010: 5.5 years.
Interest rate risk within operating leases is hedged 100% by agreeing fixed rentals with the lessors prior to inception of the lease contracts.
Fair value changes in the 250.0m Sterling bond relating to the LIBOR element are hedged with coupon swaps.
These swaps match the fair value movements in the bond in the income statement and have the same term as the bond.
Interest income is received in January and payments made in March and September each year.
The following sensitivity analysis details the Groups sensitivity to a 100 basis points 1% increase in interest rates throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant.

Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate hedges The following table details the notional amounts of interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the reporting date.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the reporting date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annual basis.
The differences between the fixed and floating rates are settled on a net basis.
All other swaps are cash flow hedges of variable rate interest where the fixed rate is interest payable.
Fuel price risk The Group purchases diesel fuel on a floating price basis in its UK Bus, UK Rail, US and Canadian bus operations and therefore is exposed to changes in diesel prices, of which the most significant element is crude oil price risk.
The Groups policy objective is to maintain a significant degree of fixed price protection in the short term with lower levels of protection over the medium term, so that the businesses affected are protected from any sudden and significant increases and have time to prepare for potentially higher costs, whilst retaining some access for potentially lower costs over the medium term.
The Group primarily uses fixed rate swap instruments to achieve significant fixed price certainty.
During the year to 31 March 2012, the Group was hedged 75% on fuel price risk.
The Group has also entered into swaps for periods from April 2012 to March 2014 with the majority of these swaps relating to the year to 31 March 2013.
The swaps give rise to monthly cash flow exchanges with counterparties to offset the underlying settlement of floating price costs, except where they have a deferred start date.
Gains or losses on fuel derivatives are recycled from equity to the income statement on qualifying hedges to achieve fixed rate fuel costs within operating results.
The following analysis details the Groups sensitivity on profit after tax and equity if the price of crude oil had been $10 per barrel higher at the year end: 2012 2011 2010 m m m Impact on profit after tax 4.6 1.8 Impact on hedging reserve 19.2 18.2 23.2 Volume at risk for the year to 31 March 2013 is 3.9m barrels 2012: 4.2m: 2011: 4.2m for which 80% is hedged to diesel price risk.

FirstGroup Annual Report and Accounts 2012 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
The insurance claims provision arises from estimated exposures for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that the majority of such claims will be settled within the next six years.
The utilisation of 162.8m 2011: 121.2m represents payments made largely against the current liability of the preceding year.
Legal and other provisions relate to estimated exposures for cases filed or thought highly likely to be filed for incidents that occurred prior to the balance sheet date.
It is anticipated that most of these items will be settled within ten years.
Also included are provisions in respect of costs anticipated on the exit of surplus properties which are expected to be settled over the remaining terms of the respective leases.
The provision for future losses on the FGW franchise will be utilised over the remaining term of the franchise which is expected to end in March 2013.
The pensions provision relates to unfunded obligations that arose on the acquisition of certain UK Bus companies.
It is anticipated that this will be utilised over five to ten years.

Reserves The hedging reserve records the movement on designated hedging items.
The share premium account represents the premium on shares issued since 1999 and arose principally on the rights issue on the Ryder acquisition in 1999 and the share placings in 2007 and 2008.
The own shares reserve represents the cost of shares in FirstGroup plc purchased in the market and either held as treasury shares or held in trust to satisfy the exercise of share options.

Contingent liabilities and assets To support subsidiary undertakings in their normal course of business, the Company and certain subsidiaries have indemnified certain banks and insurance companies who have issued performance bonds for 532.5m 2011: 460.2m: 2010: 458.2m and letters of credit for 299.3m 2011: 316.7m: 2010: 335.1m.
The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses of 314.2m 2011: 260.8m: 2010: 260.0m and the UK Rail franchise operations of 218.3m 2011: 199.4m: 2010: 198.2m.
The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the UK and North America.
The Company has provided unsecured loan facilities of 76.4m 2011: 87.5m: 2010: 96.4m to First Greater Western Limited, a 46.0m 2011:46.0m: 2010: 46.0m unsecured loan facility to First Capital Connect Limited, a 3.2m 2011: 3.2m: 2010: 3.2m unsecured loan facility to First Keolis TransPennine Limited, and a 13.6m 2011: 13.6m: 2010: 13.6m unsecured loan facility to First ScotRail Limited.
Under these facilities, 35.4m 2011: 46.5m: 2010: 96.4m was drawn at 31 March 2012 by First Greater Western Limited and 25.0m 2011: 25.0m: 2010: 35.0m was drawn at 31March 2012 by First Capital Connect Limited.
The Company is party to certain unsecured guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has given certain unsecured guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under certain loan notes, hire purchase contracts, finance leases, operating leases and certain pension scheme arrangements.
It also provides unsecured cross guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation.
UK Bus subsidiaries have provided unsecured guarantees on a joint and several basis to the Trustees of the UK Bus Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have issued unsecured guarantees to the Companys Sterling bondholders, to lenders participating in the Groups 780.8m 2011: 779.2m: 2010: 1,511.8m syndicated unsecured bank facility and to certain bilateral bank facilities for 397.3m 2011:443.7m: 2010: 554.5m and to senior unsecured loan notes for 93.3m 2011: nil.
The Group has issued guarantees of 7.0m 2011: 11.0m to Danish and Swedish authorities in respect of DSBFirst.
In addition the Group invested a further 4.2m in DSBFirst during the year and whilst the Directors believe that this amount should be recoverable at the end of the Danish franchise, any deterioration in trading may make this investment partly or wholly irrecoverable.
The FGW provision for future losses was calculated based on the assumption that this franchise would end on 31 March 2013 and whilst the DfT have verbally indicated that this will be the case, they have the discretion to extend the franchise by up to seven rail periods beyond this date.
If the franchise is extended beyond 31 March 2013 then losses may be higher than the 56.9m provided as at 31 March 2012 for the year to 31 March 2013.
In its normal course of business UK Rail has ongoing contractual negotiations with governmental and other organisations.
The First Transit contract for the provision of US military base services in Diego Garcia is currently out to tender and the Group believes that a new contractor will take over this contract in late 2012.
In this event the provision for future losses made in 2011 will be sufficient to cover projected losses up to the end of the contract.
If, however, this contract is not taken by another party and runs through until 2017 then provision for further losses under this contract may be required.

The expected life usedin the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and .
Allowances have been made for the SAYE schemes for the fact that, amongst a group of recipients some are expected to leave before an entitlement vests.
The accounting charge is then adjusted over the vesting period to take account of actual forfeitures, so although the total charge is unaffected by the pre-vesting forfeiture assumption, the timing of the recognition of the expense will be sensitive to it.
Fair values for the SAYE include a 10% p. a. prevesting leaver assumption whereas the Executive, LTIP and deferred share plans exclude any allowance for pre-vesting forfeitures.
The Group used the inputs noted above to measure the fair value of the new share options.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the schemes prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the Group are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 6.5m 2011: 5.9m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
Defined benefit schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally defined benefit schemes under which benefits provided are based on employees number of years of service and either career average or final salary.
The scope of benefits varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups finances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
The various defined benefit schemes include six UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
First Greater Western Limited, First Capital Connect Limited, First ScotRail Limited and First TransPennine Express Limited have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, which is an industry-wide arrangement.
Under the terms of the RPS, any fund deficit or surplus is shared by the employer 60% and the employees 40%.
In calculating the Groups pension obligations in respect of the RPS the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit which is projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
At their last triennial valuations, the defined benefit schemes had funding levels between 61.0% and 101.9% 2011: 61.0% and 122.4%: 2010: 74.0% and 122.4%.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2012 for all defined benefit schemes totalled 3,397m 2011: 3,289m: 2010: 3,127m.
Contributions are paid to all defined benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The valuations are made using the Projected Unit Credit Method.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.
