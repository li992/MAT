25 Contingencies and capital commitments a Contingencies At the year end the Company had guaranteed until September 2013 rental commitments by F&C in respect of a property leased and fully sub-let by F&C.
Eureko BV has provided a full indemnity to the Company in respect of this guarantee.
There has been no change in the guarantee or the indemnity since the year end.
b VAT legal case A case has been brought against HMRC to seek recovery of recoverable VAT relating to the period 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
No VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset, as the outcome of the case is expected to remain uncertain for several years.
