4 Long-term incentives continued In accordance with its overarching discretion, the Remuneration Committee has considered the US$ TSR outcome in the context of the Groups financial performance over the five-year performance period and determined that the recorded US$ TSR outperformance is a genuine reflection of BHP Billitons underlying financial outperformance during the five-year performance period.
In reaching this conclusion, the Committee has considered the overall performance of the Group, including the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011 and the impact of this on STI outcomes for GMC members.
This qualitative judgement, which is applied before final vesting is confirmed, is an important risk management aspect to ensure that vesting is not simply driven by a formula that may give unexpected or unintended remuneration outcomes.
6.7 Statutory remuneration disclosures for the GMC This section provides full details of service contract terms, disclosed remuneration and equity holdings for members of the GMC.
1 Senior management in FY2012 Key Management Personnel KMP The Australian Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards require BHP Billiton to make certain disclosures for KMP, defined as those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group, directly or indirectly.
For the purposes of this Remuneration Report, it has been determined that the KMP are the Directors and the members of the GMC who served during FY2012.
Members of the GMC and their service contracts Dates of appointment of all current GMC members appear in section 4.2 of this Annual Report and the dates of their current service contracts appear in the table below: Mike Henry and Graham Kerr were appointed to the GMC effective from 28 November 2011.
Alex Vanselow retired from the GMC and from BHP Billiton effective from 28 February 2012.
All other members of the GMC were members for the whole of FY2012.
The service contracts for all members of the GMC have no fixed term.
They typically outline the components of remuneration paid to the individual, but do not prescribe how remuneration levels are to be modified from year to year.
The contracts are all capable of termination by BHP Billiton on 12 months notice.
The GMC member must give six months notice.
In addition, the Group retains the right to terminate a contract immediately by making a payment equal to 12 months base salary plus retirement benefits for that period.

2 Statutory disclosures The table below has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 made thereunder and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and relevant accounting standards.
An explanation of the share-based payments terms used in the table is provided following the table and associated footnotes.
The figures provided in the shaded columns of the statutory table below for share-based payments were not actually provided to the KMP during FY2012.
These amounts are calculated in accordance with accounting standards and are the amortised IFRS fair values of equity and equity-related instruments that have been granted to the executives, either in relation to FY2012 performance or that of prior financial years.
4 and 6.8 for information on awards allocated during FY2011 and FY2012.
Amounts shown in this table reflect the amounts paid over the 12-month period from 1 July to 30 June each year.
All GMC base salaries are expressed in US dollars.
More detail on base salaries is provided in section 6.6.
2 Annual cash incentive is the cash portion of STI reward earned in respect of performance during each financial year as described in section 6.6.
3, that section shows the STI award earned as a percentage of the maximum award, where the maximum possible award is 100 per cent.
The remaining portion of the 100 per cent maximum has not been earned i. e. it has been forfeited.
The minimum possible value awarded is nil.
As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, both Marius Kloppers and Mike Yeager advised the Remuneration Committee that they did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012.
The Committee and the Board respected and agreed with that decision.
Actual payments are made in September, once performance has been assessed, e. g. in September 2012 for FY2012 awards.
The equity portion of STI rewards is described in footnote 6 below.
3 Non-monetary benefits are non-pensionable and include such items as health and other insurances and fees for tax return preparation sometimes in multiple jurisdictions and to a capped amount.
4 Other benefits are non-pensionable and include relocation allowances and assistance and the payment of US$104,162 in lieu for leave accrued but not taken by Mr Yeager in FY2012, as US-based Group executives are not allowed to roll forward annual leave entitlements from one financial year to the next.
The amount shown in this column for Alex Vanselow is described in footnote 9 below.
5 Retirement benefits are calculated as a percentage of base salary for each GMC member, as set out in the table in section 6.6.
6 The amounts shown in this column are described below these footnotes.
3 shows the STI reward earned as a percentage of the maximum award, where the maximum possible award is 100 per cent.
These share-based payments may also be forfeited after allocation in specific circumstances as described in sections 6.6.
1 and therefore, the minimum possible value of the awards is nil.
The maximum possible value cannot be determined as it depends on future share price movements, but is estimated by the IFRS fair value used for accounting purposes in this table.
At the date of this Annual Report, GMC members had not made their elections for Deferred Shares and or Options in regard to FY2012 STI rewards.
No GMC members elected to receive Options in respect of FY2011 awards.
The actual number of Deferred Shares allocated in respect of FY2011 awards is shown in section 6.8.
2 also describes the Shareplus program and the contributions made during FY2011 and FY2012 by members of the GMC in relation to the rights to acquire Matching Shares, which are included as share-based remuneration in the table.
7 The amounts shown in this column are described below these footnotes.
4 shows the LTI provided as a percentage of the maximum award, where the maximum possible award is 100 per cent.
5 and therefore the minimum possible value of the awards is nil.
Details of individual awards are set out in the table in section 6.8.
This column also includes the amount allocated to remuneration for each year in respect of awards received by Andrew Mackenzie on commencement of employment with BHP Billiton.
These awards, are in the form of Performance Shares allocated on 4 December 2008 as shown in the table in section 6.8.
4 and conditional rights to receive cash sums under two phantom awards, which are treated as cash-settled share-based payments and are included in this column for the purposes of remuneration.
The awards were approved by the Committee for the purposes of compensating Mr Mackenzie for awards forgone by him as a result of leaving his former employer.
The value and nature of the awards were determined by the Committee as being an equivalent fair value as that forgone by Mr Mackenzie under the at risk remuneration arrangements operated by his former employer.
In valuing the awards, the Committee sought the advice of its independent adviser, Kepler Associates.
Full details of the awards were disclosed in the FY2009 Annual Report.
8 All remuneration details for Mike Henry and Graham Kerr are for the part of the year relating to their service as members of the GMC, i. e. from 28 November 2011 to 30 June 2012.
This includes the amount of base salary and retirement benefits provided for the part of the year that they were members of the GMC, and the relevant portions of non-monetary benefits and of annual relocation allowances which were paid in relation to international moves prior to their appointment as members of the GMC.
The amount shown as annual cash incentive is the amount of cash STI paid for their performance for the period from 28 November 2011 to 30 June 2012.
The amounts included in share-based payments include the amortised IFRS fair value of awards provided under the LTIP, MAP and GSTIP equity plans prior to their appointment as members of the GMC and Shareplus Matched Shares allocated in April 2012 to Mr Henry as shown in the tables in section 6.8.
9 All remuneration details for Alex Vanselow are for the part of the year from 1 July 2011 until his retirement from the Group on 28 February 2012.
This includes the amount of base salary, retirement benefits and non-monetary benefits provided to 28 February 2012.
The amount shown as annual cash incentive is the amount of cash STI paid for Mr Vanselows performance under the GIS STI plan for the period from 1 July 2011 to 28 February 2012, assessed at the relevant time on the basis of on-target individual and Group performance.
The amount shown as other benefits is the value of statutory annual leave and long service leave entitlements paid to Mr Vanselow at the time of his retirement.
The amount included in share-based payments includes the amortisation of share-based payments for the period from 1 July 2011 to 28 February 2012, plus US$608,949, being predominantly the remainder of the IFRS fair value not recognised in previous financial years in respect of the Deferred Shares granted to him under the GIS for FY2012 and FY2011, which transferred to him in full on leaving, in accordance with the GIS rules and shareholder approval obtained at the 2011 AGMs.
1 shows Mr Vanselows GIS holdings.
Additionally, he was entitled to receive his accumulated benefits under the pension plans of which he was a member.
