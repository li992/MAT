Issue costs amounted to $6,979,000 resulting in net proceeds of $158,021,000.
HOC issued 1,650 $100,000 unsecured convertible bonds at par, which had a maturity of five years and one day and an annual coupon of 8% payable semi-annually on 17 August and 17 February of each year.
Bondholders had the right to convert the Bonds into Ordinary Shares at a price of $4.70 per share at any time.
The number of Ordinary Shares receivable on conversion of the Bonds is xed.
The Company had the right to redeem, in whole or part, the Bonds for cash at any time on or before 16 February 2008, at 150% of par value.
This right was not exercised.
The fair value of the host liability component of the Bonds net of issue costs was estimated at $140,154,000 on 16 February 2007.
The difference between the $165 million due on maturity and the initial liability component is accreted using the effective interest rate method and is recorded as finance costs.
As the Company call option meant that conversion feature could be settled in cash in accordance with IAS 32, the conversion was treated as a derivative liability.
The fair value of this derivative liability estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model was $17,867,000 at 16 February 2007 and subsequent gains and losses were recorded in finance income and costs up to the expiry of the Company call option on 17 February 2008.
As a result of the expiry of this option, and hence the cash settlement feature, the Company has reassessed the classication of the conversion option and determined that it qualies to be treated as equity under IAS 32, being an option to convert a xed amount of cash for a xed number of shares.
Therefore, the fair value of the conversion option was reclassied to equity at that date.
Bondholders had a put option requiring the Company to redeem the Bonds at par, plus accrued interest, in the event of a change of control of the Company or revocation or surrender of the Zapadno Chumpasskoye licence in Russia the contingent put option.
In the event of a change of control and redemption of the Bonds or exercise of the conversion rights, a cash payment of up to $19,700 on each Bond will be made to a Bondholder, the amount of which depends upon the date of redemption and market value of shares at the date of any change of control event.
The contingent put option has been valued separately.
The fair value of the contingent put option was estimated fide minimis by the Company at 31 December 2011.
The fair value measurement of the contingent put optionwas categorised as Level 2.
Convertible bonds were repaid in full in February 2012.
