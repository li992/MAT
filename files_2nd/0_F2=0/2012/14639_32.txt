Notes to the accounts continued 27 Employee benefits continued b Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and other senior managers and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts.
The vesting of the first part, amounting to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure.
The vesting of the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
For the 2008 to 2010 awards, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
For awards made in 2011, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.

The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the ESOP when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

31 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000. Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is extremely varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Historically losses from trade receivables have been low.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
The average rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was 0.6% 2011: 0.75%.
Currency exposures As explained above, the Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the Euro was a net monetary liability of 543,000 2011 net monetary liability: 1,121,000 and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 7,961,000 2011: 6,533,000.
At 31st December the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 0.65% 2011: 14.6% for the Euro and 0.0% 2011: 1.0% for the US dollar.

The forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.
At 31st December the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase 1,016,000 with US dollars, 534,000 with US dollars, Swedish SEK1,547,000 with US dollars and Danish DKK 471,000 with US dollars.
The fair values at the end of the reporting period were 1,558,000 2011: 27,059,000.
The fair value of cash flow hedges falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: The Group 2012 2011 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 14,555 15,937 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three 12,500 27,055 15,937 The Parent 2012 2011 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 8,000 7,427 Expiring in more than two years but no more than three 12,500 20,500 7,427 124 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Overview Strategy and performance Sustainability Governance Financial statements 125 31 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year-end exchange rates Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 250,000 2011: 150,000.
At the year-end borrowings totalled 48,156,000 consequently, in respect of financial liabilities, the Group is not significantly at risk from increases in interest rates.
For the year ended 31st December 2012, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows would have increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1,800,000 2011: 1,600,000.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
