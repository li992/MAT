under both the Repurchase Program and the Stock Swap authorizations require annual shareholder approval.
The existing shareholder approval is limited to a maximum of 21.5 million ordinary shares and is valid until the earlier of the conclusion of the Carnival plc 2013 annual general meeting or October 10, 2013.
Finally, under the Stock Swap programs, any sales of the Carnival Corporation common stock and Carnival plc ordinary shares have been or will be registered under the Securities Act.
During 2012 and 2011, no Carnival Corporation common stock or Carnival plc ordinary shares were sold or repurchased under the Stock Swap programs.
During 2010, Carnival Investments Limited sold 14.8 million shares of Carnival plc ordinary shares for total net proceeds of $545 million.
Substantially all of the net proceeds of these sales were used to purchase 14.8 million shares of Carnival Corporation common stock.
During 2010, no Carnival Corporation common stock was sold and no Carnival plc ordinary shares were repurchased under the Stock Swap program.
At January 22, 2013, the remaining availability under the Stock Swap programs repurchase authorizations were 18.1 million Carnival plc ordinary shares and 32.8 million Carnival Corporation common stock.
At November 30, 2012, we had liquidity of $6.0 billion.
Our liquidity consisted of $195 million of cash and cash equivalents, which excludes $270 million of cash used for current operations, $2.5 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facilities and $3.3 billion under committed ship financings.
Of this $3.3 billion of committed ship financings, $0.8 billion, $1.0 billion, $1.0 billion and $0.4 billion are scheduled to be funded in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.
Substantially all of our revolving credit facilities are scheduled to mature in 2016.
These commitments are from numerous large and well-established banks and export credit agencies, which we believe will honor their contractual agreements with us.
In December 2012, we issued $500 million of unsecured publicly-traded notes, which bear interest at 1.9% and are due in 2017.
We are using the net proceeds of these notes for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of portions of debt facilities maturing in 2013.
Substantially all of our debt agreements contain financial covenants as described in Note 5 Debt in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
At November 30, 2012, we believe we were in compliance with our debt covenants.
In addition, based on, among other things, our forecasted operating results, financial condition and cash flows, we expect to be in compliance with our debt covenants for the foreseeable future.
Generally, if an event of default under any debt agreement occurs, then pursuant to cross default acceleration clauses, substantially all of our outstanding debt and derivative contract payables could become due, and all debt and derivative contracts could be terminated.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantee contracts, retained or contingent interests, certain derivative instruments and variable interest entities that either have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk For a discussion of our hedging strategies and market risks, see the discussion below and Note 11 Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks Operational and Investment Currency Risks We have $235 million of foreign currency forwards that are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign operations, which have a euro-denominated functional currency, thus partially offsetting this foreign 57 currency exchange rate risk.
Based on a 10% hypothetical change in the U. S. dollar to euro exchange rate as of November 30, 2012, we estimate that these foreign currency forwards fair values would change by $24 million, which would be offset by a corresponding change of $24 million in the U. S. dollar value of our net investments.
In addition, based on a 10% hypothetical change in the U. S. dollar to euro, sterling and Australian dollar exchange rates as of November 30, 2012, which are the functional currencies that we translate into our U. S. dollar reporting currency, we estimate that our 2013 full year December 20, 2012 non-GAAP guidance would change by $0.20 per share.
Newbuild Currency Risks In June 2012, we entered into foreign currency zero cost collars that are designated as cash flow hedges for a portion of Royal Princess euro-denominated shipyard payments.
These collars mature in May 2013 at a weighted-average ceiling rate of $1.30 to the euro, or $560 million, and a weighted-average floor rate of $1.19 to the euro, or $512 million.
If the spot rate is between these two rates on the date of maturity, then we would not owe or receive any payments under these collars.
In July 2012, we entered into foreign currency zero cost collars that are designated as cash flow hedges for a portion of P&O Cruises UK newbuilds euro-denominated shipyard payments.
These collars mature in February 2015 at a weighted-average ceiling rate of 0.83 to the euro, or $294 million, and a weighted-average floor rate of 0.77 to the euro, or $272 million.
At November 30, 2012, the estimated fair value of our outstanding foreign currency zero cost collars was a net asset of $16 million.
Based on a 10% hypothetical increase or decrease in the November 30, 2012 U. S. dollar and sterling rates to euro exchange rates, we estimate the fair value of these collars would increase $60 million or decrease $40 million, respectively.
At November 30, 2012, substantially all our remaining newbuild currency exchange rate risk relates to eurodenominated newbuild construction payments for Regal Princess and a portion of P&O Cruises UK s newbuild.
These newbuild contracts have remaining commitments of $1.1 billion.
The functional currency cost of each of these ships will increase or decrease based on changes in the exchange rates until the payments are made under the shipbuilding contract, or we enter into a foreign currency hedge.
Based on a 10% hypothetical change in the U. S. dollar and sterling to euro exchange rates as of November 30, 2012, the unpaid cost of these ships would have a corresponding change of $111 million.
Interest Rate Risks At November 30, 2012, we have interest rate swaps that effectively changed $269 million of EURIBOR-based floating rate euro debt to fixed rate euro debt.
Based on a 10% hypothetical change in the November 30, 2012 market interest rates, the fair value of all our debt and related interest rate swaps would change by $84 million.
In addition, based on a 10% hypothetical change in the November 30, 2012 market interest rates, our annual interest expense on floating rate debt, including the effect of our interest rate swaps, would change by an insignificant amount.
Substantially all of our fixed rate debt can only be called or prepaid by incurring significant costs, therefore it is unlikely we will be able to take any significant steps in the short-term to mitigate our fixed rate debt exposure in the event of a significant decrease in market interest rates.
Fuel Price Risks Our exposure to market risk for changes in fuel prices substantially all relates to the consumption of fuel on our ships.
We expect to consume approximately 3.3 million metric tons of fuel in 2013.
Based on a 10% hypothetical change in our December 20, 2012 guidances forecasted average fuel price, we estimate that our 2013 fuel expense, excluding the effect of zero cost collar fuel derivatives, would change by $230 million.
58 We use our fuel derivatives program to mitigate a portion of our economic risk attributable to potential fuel price increases.
See Note 11 Fair Value Measurements, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our fuel derivatives program.
At November 30, 2012, we had fuel derivatives consisting of zero cost collars on Brent to cover a portion of our estimated fuel consumption through 2016.
Based on a 10% hypothetical change in the Brent spot price used in our December 20, 2012 guidance, there would be no impact to our 2013 cash flows from realized gains and losses on our fuel derivatives as the resulting Brent price would remain within the ceiling and floor Brent prices established by these collars.
At November 30, 2012, the estimated fair value of our outstanding fuel derivative contracts was a net asset of $6 million.
Based on a 10% hypothetical increase or decrease in the November 30, 2012 Brent forward price curve, we estimate the fair value of our fuel derivatives would increase $120 million or decrease $105 million, respectively.
