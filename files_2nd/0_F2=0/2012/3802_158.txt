92 Compass Group PLC Annual Report 2012 I Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2012 11 Goodwill continued 2012 2011 Residual Pre-tax Residual Pre-tax growth discount growth discount Growth and discount rates rates rates rates rates USA 2.2% 9.9% 2.5% 9.3% Rest of North America 2.2% 8.8% 2.5% 8.5% UK 2.3% 9.0% 3.4% 9.4% Rest of Europe & Japan 0.3-3.0% 7.3-16.8% 0.8-2.5% 6.6-12.0% Fast Growing & Emerging 2.2-7.9% 8.5-18.8% 2.3-5.9% 8.2-14.5% Given the current economic climate, a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be reasonably possible by management.
For the UK, to which goodwill of 1,803 million is allocated, an increase in the discount rate of 0.2% or a decrease in the long-term growth rate of 0.2% would eliminate the headroom of approximately 46 million under each scenario.
There are no other CGUs that are sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.
In 2011, for the UK, to which goodwill of 1,778 million was allocated, an increase in the discount rate of 0.7% or a decrease in the long-term growth rate of 0.8% would have eliminated the headroom of approximately 280 million under each scenario.
