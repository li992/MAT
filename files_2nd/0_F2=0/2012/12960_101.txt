Financial risk management continued Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily euro, South African rand and Communaut Financire Africaine franc.
As a result, the group is subject to exposure from uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In general, the group does not enter into derivatives to manage these currency risks and none existed in 2011 or 2012.
Generally, the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price uctuation risk and gold was sold at market spot prices in 2011 and 2012.
Gold sales are made in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency uctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company may use forward contracts or options to reduce the exposure to price movements, while maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
These derivatives may establish a xed price for a portion of future production while the group maintains the ability to benefit from increases in the spot gold price for the majority of future gold production.
The group is also exposed to uctuations in the price of consumables, such as fuel, steel, rubber, cyanide and lime, mainly due to changes in the price of oil, as well as uctuations in exchange rates.

Financial risk management continued Interest rate and liquidity risk Fluctuations in interest rates impact on the value of short term cash investments and interest payable on nancing activities including long term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.

The group generally enters into variable interest bearing borrowings.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source nancing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
The finance lease entered in the year bears a xed rate of interest.
The group typically holds financial investments with an average maturity of 30 days to ensure adequate liquidity.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from the proceeds of its gold sales and is required to fund working capital requirements.

Concentration of credit risk The groups cash balances do not give rise to a significant concentration of credit risk because it deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed.
Receivables are impaired when it is probable that amounts outstanding are not recoverable as set out in the accounting policy note for receivables.
Gold bullion, the groups principal product, is produced in Mali and Cte dIvoire.
The gold produced is sold to the largest accredited gold renery in the world.
Credit risk is further managed by regularly reviewing the financial statements of the renery.
The group is further not exposed to significant credit risk on gold sales, as cash is received within a few days of the sale taking place.
While not financial assets for IFRS 7, included in receivables is US$119.7 million 2011: US$35.1 million refer to note 7 relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila and Loulo by the State of Mali and the DRC, which are denominated in FCFA, which holds some credit risk for the group.
The mining conventions in Mali permit offsetting of other corporate taxes against approved but unpaid TVA.
Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, buyback shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt net cash divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings and trade and other payables, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position, plus net debt net cash.
