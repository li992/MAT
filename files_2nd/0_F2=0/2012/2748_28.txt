Foreign currency translation Group Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arising on consolidation of subsidiary undertakings are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Company During 2011 the functional currency of the Company changed from to $ and accordingly the Companys foreign currency translation reserves were transferred to retained earnings during 2011.
6.2 Capital Management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The Board manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Board may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2012.

120 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Section 6 Capital Structure and Other Disclosures Continued 6.4 Share-based Payments Accounting Policies The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans are recognised over the three year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using the binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group operates a number of share-based schemes for the benefit of its employees.
