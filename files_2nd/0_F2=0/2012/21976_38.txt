Jurisdictional netting has been applied except for BTs pension schemes which are disclosed as deferred tax assets.
At 31 March 2012, all of the deferred tax asset of 626m 2011: 461m is expected to be recovered after more than one year.
At 31 March 2012, all of the deferred tax liability of 1,100m 2011: 1,212m is expected to be settled after more than one year.
Factors affecting future tax charges The rate of UK corporation tax changed from 26% to 24% on 1 April 2012.
As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods of the reversal, deferred tax balances at 31 March 2012 have been calculated using a rate of 24%.
The impact of the change of rate decreased deferred tax assets by 48m and deferred tax liabilities by 91m totalling a reduction in net liabilities of 43m.
This reduction has been recognised as a deferred tax credit of 164m in the income statement note 9 and a deferred tax expense of 121m in other comprehensive income.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 22% by 1 April 2014.
The future annual corporation tax reductions of 1% are expected to affect the groups financial statements.
The actual impact will depend on the groups deferred tax position at that time.

Taxation continued Unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences At 31 March 2012, the group had operating losses, capital losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to 21.8bn 2011: 23.5bn.
The groups capital losses and other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions.
The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose.
A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below: 2012 At 31 March m Expiry of losses Restricted losses Europe 430 2013-27 Americas 149 2013-20 Asia 8 2013-16 Total restricted losses 587 Unrestricted losses Operating losses 3,430 No expiry Capital losses 17,225 No expiry Total unrestricted losses 20,655 Other temporary differences 576 Total 21,818 At 31 March 2012, the undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was 5.2bn 2011: 5.3bn.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised are insignicant.
Dividends There were no dividends paid in 2012, 2011 or 2010.
The directors have declared a final dividend of 1,400m.
