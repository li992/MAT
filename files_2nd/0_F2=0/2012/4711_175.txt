During the year ended 30 June 2011 whisky inventory was transferred into the partnership.
The group retains control over the partnership which at 30 June 2012 held inventory with a book value of 565 million 2011 535 million.
The partnership is fully consolidated in the group financial statements.
The UK Scheme acquired a limited interest in the partnership, and as a partner, is entitled to a distribution from the profits of the partnership each year from the date the partnership was established until the year ending 30 June 2024.
This profit share was 25 million in the year ended 30 June 2012 and is expected to be approximately the same amount for the next 13 years.
In 2024 the group will be required, dependent upon the funding position of the UK Scheme at that time, to pay an amount expected to be no greater than the deficit at that time, up to a maximum of 430 million in cash, to the UK Scheme to buy out the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
Under IAS 19 Employee benefits the interest in the partnership does not represent a plan asset for group reporting purposes and therefore the UK Schemes deficit position presented in these financial statements does not reflect the UK Schemes interest in the partnership.
Accordingly, distributions from the partnership to the UK Scheme are reflected in the consolidated group financial statements on a cash basis as distributions are paid.
The group has also agreed to make conditional contributions into escrow of up to 338 million if an equivalent reduction in the deficit is not achieved over the 10 year term of the funding plan.
The escrow account would be payable to the UK Scheme after the triennial funding trustee valuations.
The triennial valuation as at 31 March 2012 is in progress and may result in the payment of up to 127 million in three equal annual instalments, into escrow.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo continues to make a cash contribution in respect of current service costs based on the UK Scheme trustees valuation.
This contribution is expected to be 45 million to the UK Scheme for the year ending 30 June 2013.
The group has also agreed a deficit funding arrangement with the trustees of the Irish Scheme under which it contributes to the Irish Scheme 21 million 17 million per annum until the year ending 30 June 2029.
The agreement also provides for additional cash contributions into escrow of up to 188 million 152 million if an equivalent reduction in the deficit is not achieved over the 18 year period.
As part of this funding plan, Diageo has granted to the Irish Scheme a contingent asset comprising mortgages over certain land and buildings and fixed and floating charges over certain receivables of the group up to a value of 200 million 161 million.
In addition to the deficit funding the group expects to make cash contributions of 29 million 23 million to the Irish Scheme in the year ending 30 June 2013.
The group also expects to make cash contributions of 90 million to all other post employment schemes in the year ending 30 June 2013.
