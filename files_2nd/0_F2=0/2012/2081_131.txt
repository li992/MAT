1 Remuneration mix While the Board recognises that market forces necessarily influence Remuneration mix for members of the GMC remuneration practices, it strongly believes that the fundamental shown as a percentage of base salary driver of our remuneration arrangements should be business performance.
Accordingly, while target Total Remuneration is structured to attract and retain executives, the amount of LTI 200% remuneration actually received is dependent on the achievement fair value 146% of superior business and individual performance and on generating sustained shareholder value from relative performance.
At risk components of remuneration therefore represent a significant portion of Total Remuneration, are subject to performance conditions and At Risk Deferred STI 160% to ongoing service, and are designed to deliver appropriate pay 38% over one-, threeand five-year time horizons.
Maximum and actual remuneration mix The diagram to the right illustrates the relative proportion of each Cash STI 160% remuneration component for members of the GMC.
38% Base salary forms the foundation of the remuneration mix and each Retirement and 43% 43% other benefits of the other components is described as a percentage of base salary.
Fixed The diagram therefore shows base salary as 100 per cent with each Base salary 100% 100% additional component relative to that base salary.
The first column of the diagram shows the mix that would have Maximum Average actual award applied if the maximum at risk rewards had been earned.
The mix in relation is the same for all GMC members.
The second column shows the to FY2012 comparative actual Total Remuneration received in relation to FY2012 as shown in the table in section 6.5.
2 as an average across the six full-year GMC members, excluding Mike Henry, Graham Kerr and Alex Vanselow.
2 Fixed remuneration Base salary Base salary is reviewed annually and any changes are effective from 1 September each year.
It is benchmarked relative to comparable roles in global companies of similar complexity, size, reach and industry and reflects an individuals responsibilities, location, performance, qualifications and experience within the Group.
Reviews also consider general economic conditions and salary reviews across the rest of the Group.
As a consequence of the base salary review undertaken this year, and in recognition of the prevailing business climate, a decision has been taken to freeze the base salaries of GMC members for FY2013.
Base salary is stated and paid in US dollars for all GMC members.
Non-statutory table: Base salary amounts in the table below are effective 1 September and are not linked to any specific financial year.
They therefore do not match with the 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 salaries shown in sections 6.5.
Their base salaries prior to this time are not applicable.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 141 6 Remuneration Report continued 6.6.
2 Fixed remuneration continued Retirement benefits As part of fixed remuneration, all GMC members are entitled to retirement benefits under defined contribution plans for all new entrants and legacy defined benefit plans.
New entrants are given a choice of funding vehicles: a Defined Contribution Plan, an Unfunded Retirement Savings Plan, an International Retirement Plan or a cash payment in lieu.
Employees in legacy defined benefit plans continue to accrue benefits in those plans for past and future service unless they have elected to transfer to a defined contribution plan.
The table below sets out the retirement benefits payable to each member of the GMC during the year.
Name Pension entitlement % of base salary Name Pension entitlement % of base salary 1 Marius Kloppers Defined Contribution 40.0 Marcus Randolph Defined Contribution 34.0 2 Alberto Calderon Defined Contribution 35.0 Alex Vanselow Defined Benefit 38.0 Mike Henry Defined Contribution 25.0 Karen Wood Defined Contribution 34.4 Graham Kerr Defined Contribution 25.0 J Michael Yeager Defined Contribution 35.8 Andrew Mackenzie Defined Contribution 36.0 1 Prior to his appointment as CEO, and under the terms of a pre-existing contract, Marius Kloppers had the choice of a i defined benefit, ii defined contribution underpinned by a defined benefit promise or iii cash in lieu pension entitlement for each year since 1 July 2001.
He elected to take cash in lieu for each year except for FY2004 when he elected to take a defined contribution entitlement with a defined benefit underpin.
Mr Kloppers retains the option to convert the entitlement accrued in the defined contribution fund to a defined benefit entitlement.
Up until FY2011, the value of his defined contribution entitlement exceeded, or was only marginally lower than, the transfer value of the defined benefit underpin that he would be entitled to should he revert to the defined benefit promise, and as such the entitlement was treated on a defined contribution basis.
However, as measured at 30 June 2012, the transfer value of the underpin US$778,527 was significantly greater than the defined contribution fund US$515,940, and as such the disclosure for this defined benefit promise is provided below.
The increase in the transfer value from FY2011 to FY2012 is predominantly due to the reduction of the discount rate to 5.3 per cent in FY2012 from 7.5 per cent in FY2011.
Upon his succession as CEO on 1 October 2007, Mr Kloppers relinquished all future defined benefit entitlements.
Transfer value of total accrued pension Accumulated total accrued Increase in accrued Increase in transfer pension at 30 June 2012 pension during the year value over the year at 30 June 2012 at 30 June 2011 31,348 446 174,965 778,527 603,562 The increase in accrued pension during the year is the difference between the accrued pension at the end of the previous year and the accrued pension at the end of the current year without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in transfer value over the year is the difference between the transfer value at the end of the year and the transfer value at the beginning of the year less the contributions made to the scheme by the participant nil, also without any allowance for inflation.
The increase in accrued pension after making an allowance for inflation of 5.0 per cent was US$1,099 and the transfer value of that increase less the contributions made to the scheme by the participant was US$27,293.
2 The treatment of these benefits upon Alex Vanselows retirement is described in section 6.7.
Other benefits GMC members are reimbursed for costs such as health and other insurances, tax return preparation sometimes in multiple jurisdictions and to a capped amount and relocation allowances and assistance.
Other benefits also include any payments in lieu of annual leave for GMC members based in the US, as they are not allowed to roll forward annual leave entitlements from one financial year to the next.
The total value of benefits provided to each GMC member during FY2012 is shown in the tables in section 6.5.
Shareplus all-employee share purchase plan Members of the GMC are also eligible to contribute up to US$5,000 per annum from their post-tax base salary to participate in Shareplus, the all-employee share purchase plan.
More details of the plan and of the current holdings of GMC members under the plan are shown in section 6.8.
The Remuneration Committee does not consider the value of these benefits when determining Total Remuneration as shown in section 6.5.
An IFRS fair value is ascribed to any Matched Shares and included in remuneration as described in section 6.7.
3 Short-term incentives Setting performance measures An individual scorecard of measures is set for each executive at the commencement of each financial year under the Group Incentive Scheme GIS.
These measures are linked to the achievement of the business strategy and financial outcomes and also individual non-financial objectives reflecting individual contribution to the business.
The Sustainability Committee assists the Remuneration Committee in determining appropriate HSEC metrics to be included in GMC scorecards.
The GMC scorecard for the FY2012 performance year is shown below.
The scorecard measures and their relative weightings have been chosen by the Remuneration Committee as the Committee believes that they will appropriately incentivise members of the GMC to drive overall performance in the current year, including both financial performance and delivery against measures that impact the long-term sustainability of the Group.
As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, both Marius Kloppers and Mike Yeager advised the Remuneration Committee that they did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012.
The Committee and the Board respected and agreed with that decision, and would have reached the same conclusion had they been required to consider the STI award for these executives for FY2012.
In addition, this impairment impacted the outcomes for the Group PAT metric for the STI award for FY2012.
Accordingly, this has resulted in no incentive attributable to the Group PAT metric being awarded for any current GMC members in office for all of FY2012.
This scorecard applies for Mr Henry and Mr Kerr for the portion of the year from their appointment as members of the GMC effective 28 November 2011.
Determining STI outcomes At the conclusion of the financial year, each executives achievement against their measures is assessed by the Remuneration Committee and the Board and their STI award determined.
The Remuneration Committee is assisted by the Sustainability Committee and by the Risk and Audit Committee in relation to assessment of performance against HSEC and financial measures, respectively.
The Board believes this method of assessment is transparent, rigorous and balanced and provides an appropriate, objective and comprehensive assessment of performance.
For the CEO and GMC members without direct CSG responsibility, all non-individual measures are assessed on the basis of Group performance.
For those GMC members with direct CSG responsibility, measures are assessed either on Group or CSG performance as shown in the table below, with the exception of HSEC, which includes consideration of both Group and CSG performance.
The level of achievement against each of the non-individual measures for the FY2012 performance year as determined by the Remuneration Committee is set out in the table.

The Sustainability assessment Committee has again followed that approach this year.
Guiding the Environment and outcomes was the tragic loss of three lives two in Energy Coal and one occupational health in Iron Ore. Once again, they are a reminder of the vigilance and constant focus on safety that is required, and these elements were paramount in the Committees considerations when determining the outcomes for the Group and the businesses.
Against this background, both Committees noted good year-on-year improvement in TRIF across the Group and positive outcomes of our endeavours in respect of community.
Solid performances in HSE risk management, occupational health and environment were also observed.
Performance in HSEC was differentiated across the businesses, with the overall Group result considered marginally above expectations between Target and Stretch.
Petroleum performed very well against targets set between Stretch and Exceptional, Non-Ferrous businesses and Aluminium and Nickel were considered above expectations between Target and Stretch, with Ferrous and Coal businesses where the three fatalities occurred considered to have performed well below expectations at Threshold.
PAT for the Group 50.0 25.0 35.0 No incentive attributable to this metric was awarded for any current adjusted for foreign GMC members in office for all of FY2012 due to the impairment against exchange movements, the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from commodity prices and Chesapeake Energy in March 2011.
Other than this impairment, Group exceptional items PAT was below expectations between Threshold and Target due mainly to under-achievement of cost management targets this metric was applied to Mike Henry and Graham Kerr, not part of the GMC at the time of the acquisition of the Fayetteville assets.
EBIT for the relevant CSG s 25.0 Performances for the businesses varied on this metric, with results adjusted for foreign for Petroleum at zero due to the impairment against the carrying value of exchange movements, Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March commodity prices and 2011.
Performance for the Ferrous and Coal businesses were well above exceptional items targets set at the start of the year and was rated very highly at Exceptional, primarily due to very positive results in respect of FY2012 Iron Ore production volumes.
Performance for the Non-Ferrous businesses and Aluminium and Nickel were below expectations between Threshold and Target as a consequence of below-target performance on production volumes and cost management.
Capital management 15.0 7.5 10.0 Performances for the business in respect of capital project management for the Group cost metrics varied for FY2012.
The overall Group outcome was positive for and schedule capital cost performance between Target and Stretch, reflecting cost underruns on several major projects, partly offset by performance on Capital management 7.5 capital schedule metrics being less than expected marginally below for the relevant CSG s Target.
Ferrous and Coal businesses performed positively on both capital cost and schedule cost and schedule performance metrics between Target and Stretch, while both the Non-Ferrous businesses and Aluminium and Nickel performed below expectations on both capital cost between Threshold and Target and schedule performance metrics between Threshold and Target.
Petroleum performed very well against expectations on capital cost performance between Stretch and Exceptional, offset by less than expected performance on capital schedule performance metrics between Threshold and Target.
These outcomes reflected the varied cost and schedule outcomes for the 17 major projects in the portfolio for FY2012.
Individual measures 20.0 20.0 40.0 Individual measures for GMC members are determined at the based on contribution commencement of the financial year.
The Group Chairman determines to management team, the measures for the CEO, and the CEO determines measures for key project deliverables remaining GMC members.
These comprise contribution to the GMC, of each role and the delivery against projects and initiatives within the scope of his or operating model her role, and his or her contribution to the performance of the Group.
1SAP system, scalable Personal performance of those GMC members considered for an organisational structure incentive in respect of FY2012 was reviewed against these measures and people strategy, by the Committee and, on average, was considered marginally below including diversity expectations marginally below Target.
1 As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, both Marius Kloppers and Mike Yeager advised the Remuneration Committee that they did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012.
The Committee and the Board respected and agreed with that decision.
2 Applicable weightings set for Andrew Mackenzie, Marcus Randolph, Mike Yeager and Alberto Calderon for the period 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012.
3 Applicable weightings set for Alberto Calderon for the period 1 July 2011 to 31 December 2011, Alex Vanselow and Karen Wood, and for Graham Kerr and Mike Henry for the period they were members of the GMC.
4 A performance range is set for each measure with the level of performance against each KPI determined as: Threshold: the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward.
Target: where the performance requirements are met.
Stretch: where the performance requirements are exceeded.
Exceptional: where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded.
BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2012 | 143 6 Remuneration Report continued 6.6.
3 Short-term incentives continued STI targets and outcomes for the FY2012 performance year STI targets for the FY2012 performance year were set by the Remuneration Committee as part of Total Remuneration as described in section 6.5.
The target cash award was 80 per cent of base salary for all members of the GMC, with a maximum cash award of 160 per cent of base salary for exceptional performance against all scorecard measures.
The value of any cash STI award is matched by an equivalent face value of Deferred Shares or an approximately equivalent fair value in Options, or a combination of the two, at the election of the participant.
Deferred Shares are not ordinary shares and do not carry entitlements to ordinary dividends or other shareholder rights.
Dividends are not received by the executives during the vesting period.
A Dividend Equivalent Payment DEP is provided when the vesting period is over and the Deferred Shares are exercised.
More information on the terms of these deferred STI awards is provided in section 6.8.
The following table shows the amount of at risk remuneration awarded by the Committee as STI as a result of Group, business and individual performance against the above scorecard objectives for the FY2012 performance year with comparative prior year data.
The Deferred Share and or Option awards shown in the table have not yet delivered any realised value to the serving executives, as they generally do not vest and cannot be exercised for at least two years from the end of the relevant performance year, i. e. the FY2012 awards are expected to vest in August 2014.
Different vesting rules may apply for executives who leave the Group under specific circumstances as described later in this section.
Non-statutory table: Cash STI awards shown below are the same as those reported in section 6.7.
2, but this table shows the market value of the Deferred Shares and or Options at the time of allocation rather than amortising the IFRS fair value of each award over the relevant performance and service periods as per accounting standards.
The actual number of Deferred Shares allocated is determined by dividing the relevant value by the share price at the time of allocation.
The number of Options required to provide an approximately equivalent value will also be determined should any members of the GMC nominate this alternative, or a combination of Deferred Shares and Options based on a valuation conducted by Kepler Associates.
2 As a result of the impairment against the carrying value of Fayetteville shale gas assets acquired from Chesapeake Energy in March 2011, both Marius Kloppers and Mike Yeager advised the Remuneration Committee that they did not wish to be considered for a STI award for FY2012.
3 The STI maximums and outcomes shown for Mike Henry and Graham Kerr are pro-rated based on the portion of the year from 28 November 2011 when they were members of the GMC.
Mr Henry and Mr Kerr have also received pro-rated cash and equity-based STI awards for the preceding period of the FY2012 performance year, under the management Group Short-Term Incentive Plan GSTIP.
4 This simple unweighted average percentage of maximum is graphed against Group earnings later in this section.
Time frame for delivery of FY2012 STI awards for the GMC Cash awards are paid in September following the release of the Groups annual results.
Deferred Shares and Options are expected to be allocated in December after the AGMs.
Allocations to the CEO are subject to shareholder approval.
As described above, employees will generally not have access to the value of these equity awards until August 2014, as shown in the diagram below.

3 Short-term incentives continued Awards provided for GMC members leaving the Group The rules of the GIS outline the circumstances in which participants may be entitled to a cash award for the financial year in which they cease employment.
Such circumstances depend on the reason for leaving.
The only circumstance in which the Committee has considered using its discretion to allow members of the GMC to receive a cash award in the event of departure is for those individuals who have retired or are retiring.
The Committee considers it an important principle that Deferred Shares and Options will be forfeited by the individual in specific circumstances, including if they resign from the Group or their employment is terminated for cause within the two-year vesting period.
Alex Vanselow retired from the Group effective 28 February 2012.
The treatment of his STI for the FY2012 performance year and his unvested deferred STI awards relating to prior years is detailed in section 6.7.
Relationship between STI rewards and Group performance The following graphs are included as part of satisfying an Australian disclosure requirement to show the relationship between KMP remuneration and performance, including earnings.
As described earlier in this section, STI rewards for members of the GMC are based on a balanced scorecard of key performance measures.
A substantial component of each scorecard is based on measures that will drive the long-term success and sustainability of the Group, but which may not have a direct correlation to annual profitability.
Only a proportion of STI outcomes are directly related to financial measures, and that proportion varies for different members of the GMC.
The profit measure used for calculating scorecard outcomes as defined earlier in this section is not the same as the disclosed profit attributable to shareholders used in the graph below.
Due to the factors described above, some correlation between STI outcomes and the measures used in the graphs below is evident over the last five years, but there is no guarantee that this will be the case in the future.
Further details of the Groups Attributable profit and basic earnings per share over the past five years can be found in section 1.4.

4 Long-term incentives An LTI award is determined for each member of the GMC as part of their Total Remuneration relative to market, and considering the appropriate remuneration mix as described in section 6.5 and section 6.6.
These awards are provided as Performance Shares under the Groups LTIP.
Purpose and terms of the LTIP The purpose of the LTIP is to focus managements efforts on the achievement of sustainable long-term value creation and success of the Group including appropriate management of business risks and to align senior executive rewards with sustained shareholder wealth creation through the relative TSR performance condition.
The relative TSR performance condition must be achieved over a five-year period.
TSR has been chosen as the most appropriate measure as it allows for an objective external assessment over a sustained period on a basis that is familiar to shareholders.
As BHP Billitons TSR performance relative to its peers tends to be counter-cyclical, the hurdle used since December 2010 includes both a sector-based comparison 67 per cent and a comparison to a broad stock market index the MSCI World 33 per cent for assessing the Groups TSR performance in order to provide a fairer and more balanced measure of performance.
This weighting ensures a majority of the outcome is driven by our performance against that of resource industry peers.
Full details on the structure and terms of the performance condition, including a description of TSR, the relative weightings of the comparator groups, and the vesting schedule are included in a table of terms in section 6.8.
That section also includes a listing of the sector group companies and details of the interests held in BHP Billiton by members of the GMC as a result of previous participation in the LTIP.
Determining the number of Performance Shares allocated When the Remuneration Committee is determining the number of LTI awards to be allocated to GMC members, it uses the fair value calculated by Kepler Associates as defined in section 6.2.
This takes into account the impact of the performance condition, along with other factors as described in the terms table in section 6.8.
The fair value for the current plan design is 41 per cent of the face value of an award.

Whether the grants deliver any value to executives will not be determined until the end of the performance period.
In order for any benefit to be obtained by the executives from the Performance Shares, the relative five-year TSR performance hurdle must be achieved over the period from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2016, and the individual must remain employed by the Group unless they leave the Group in specific circumstances as described in the table of terms in section 6.8.
Non-statutory table: LTI awards shown below are included in the table in section 6.7.

The fair value for each executive therefore reflects the number of Performance Shares allocated, the entity over which they apply and the relevant exchange rates where applicable.
2 December 2011 fair values are calculated in the same way as described in footnote 1 above, except that average closing share prices for the three months up to and including the grant date were A$36.54 for BHP Billiton Limited shares and 19.06 for BHP Billiton Plc shares.
The face value of the 226,721 Performance Shares allocated to Marius Kloppers, at a share price of A$36.54, was therefore A$8,284,385 at the time of grant.
3 The maximum award under the LTIP is a fair value of 200 per cent of base salary for the relevant year as set out in the terms table in section 6.8.
4 During FY2012, and before their appointment as members of the GMC, Mike Henry and Graham Kerr received awards under the management MAP as shown in section 6.8.
Their first awards under the LTIP will be determined by the Committee and allocated in December 2012, along with FY2013 awards for the other members of the GMC.
5 Refer to footnote 7 of the table in section 6.8.

Proposed allocation of FY2013 LTI for the CEO On the advice of the Committee, the Board has approved an award of FY2013 Performance Shares for the CEO with a fair value of US$3,441,000, the same as in FY2012.
The same performance and service conditions will be used for the FY2013 LTI award as was used for the FY2012 LTI award.
The list of peer companies will be reviewed by the Committee prior to the LTI award being allocated.
If approved by shareholders, these FY2013 Performance Shares will be granted following the AGMs i. e. in or around December 2012.
The number of Performance Shares allocated will be notified to shareholders, when provided, along with the number of Performance Shares that will be granted to the other members of the GMC on the same date in respect of FY2013 LTI.
The actual number of Performance Shares to be granted will depend on the share price and exchange rate over the three months up to the date of grant.
As at 31 August 2012, this value for the CEO was equal to approximately 257,106 Performance Shares compared with 226,721 in December 2011.
This fair value was determined with the input of independent advisers and takes into account the appropriate level of Total Remuneration for the CEO, as assessed by reference to a number of factors as described in section 6.5.
The Committee has determined that, starting from the LTI to be allocated in December 2013, the actual number of Performance Shares to be granted will be determined with reference to the share price and exchange rate over the 12 months up to the date of grant.
This change has been deferred until next year to avoid any perception that it has been changed to accommodate prevailing conditions.
LTI vesting outcomes and the delivery of LTI award The performance hurdle for the 2006 and 2007 LTI awards requires BHP Billitons TSR to exceed the weighted average TSR of a group of peer companies by 5.5 per cent per annum on average over the five years, which is 30.7 per cent over five years.
Upon the introduction of the LTIP in 2004, the Committee, with advice from its independent adviser, Kepler Associates, determined that a common-currency approach using the US$ would be employed for TSR comparisons.
The US$ is the Groups functional and reporting currency, and a common-currency approach helps mitigate the effects of currency movements.
In addition, all GMC members, including those domiciled in Australia and the UK, receive their annual salary and cash STI denominated in US$.
TSR is determined for BHP Billiton and each company in the comparator group in US$.
The index US$ TSR of the comparator group as a whole is then determined i. e. the weighted average of the comparators and BHP Billitons TSR performance against that index TSR is tested.
Details of the comparator group companies are set out in section 6.8.
2006 allocations under the LTIP tested to the end of FY2011 and vested in FY2012 As detailed in last years Remuneration Report, the performance period for the 2006 LTIP ended on 30 June 2011 and the 2006 LTIP vested in August 2011.
The number and value of vested Performance Shares for each GMC member are provided in section 6.8.
Over the performance period, BHP Billitons US$ TSR was 138.3 per cent.
In contrast, the weighted average US$ TSR for the peer group against which the Groups performance was measured was 66.8 per cent.
The impact of this 71.5 per cent outperformance was to add US$87.7 billion of shareholder value from 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2011 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators.

Over the five-year performance period, BHP Billitons US$ TSR was 41.6 per cent.
In contrast, the weighted average US$ TSR for the peer group against which the Groups performance was measured was -4.0 per cent.
Of the 15 peer companies, only two companies recorded US$ TSR outcomes in excess of BHP Billitons 41.6 per cent US$ TSR performance one at 45.6 per cent and one at 41.9 per cent, and eight peer companies recorded negative US$ TSR performance over the five-year performance period.
The impact of this 45.6 per cent US$ TSR outperformance by BHP Billiton over the weighted average was to add US$75.4 billion of shareholder value from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2012 over and above performance in line with the weighted average of the comparators as shown in the graphs below.

The following factors comprise the US$ TSR calculation: movements in shares prices in US$ of BHP Billiton and companies in the LTIP comparator group during the five-year performance period, based on the three-month average US$ share price to the start of the five-year performance period three months up to and including 30 June 2007 compared to the three-month average US$ share price to the end of the five-year performance period three months up to and including 30 June 2012.
The averaging period is used to avoid the consequences of short-term share price and exchange rate fluctuations: dividends paid in US$ by BHP Billiton and companies in the LTIP comparator group during the five-year performance period, assuming that dividends paid are reinvested in the relevant company on the date the dividends were paid.
The table below shows the share prices for BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton Plc in US$ for the three months up to and including 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2012 and the dividends paid over the five-year performance period.
The three-month average US$ share prices have been determined with reference to three-month average share prices quoted on the London Stock Exchange in and the Australian Stock Exchange in A$, converted to US$ at the relevant three-month average exchange rates.

The actual calculation of TSR for the LTIP performance hurdle assumes that the dividends paid are reinvested in the relevant company on the date that the dividends are paid.
The contribution of dividends to TSR performance will therefore vary from the indicative numbers shown in the table above.
