Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2012 141 3 Adjusted gures Reed Elsevier uses adjusted gures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted gures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition related costs, disposal gains and losses and other non operating items, related tax effects, exceptional prior year tax credits in 2012 only and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term and include the benefit of tax amortisation where available on acquired goodwill and intangible assets.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Acquisition related costs relate to acquisition integration, professional and other transaction related fees, and adjustments to deferred and contingent consideration.
Adjusted operating cash ow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to prior year  programmes and acquisition related costs.
Adjusted gures are derived as follows: 2012 2011 m m Operating profit 1,670 1,386 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 405 413 Acquisition related costs 26 59 Share of profit on disposals in joint ventures 1 Reclassication of tax in joint ventures 6 13 Adjusted operating profit 2,107 1,870 profit before tax 1,460 1,090 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 405 413 Acquisition related costs 26 59 Reclassication of tax in joint ventures 6 13 Disposals and other non operating items 56 25 Adjusted profit before tax 1,841 1,600 profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 1,315 874 Adjustments post tax : Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 413 408 Acquisition related costs 20 38 Disposals and other non operating items 127 19 Exceptional prior year tax credits 118 Deferred tax credits on acquired intangible assets not expected to crystallise in the near term 103 120 Adjusted profit attributable to parent companies shareholders 1,400 1,219 Cash generated from operations 2,272 1,995 Dividends received from joint ventures 25 38 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 86 98 Proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment 9 8 Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets 323 305 Payments in relation to exceptional restructuring costs 30 60 Payments in relation to acquisition related costs 45 44 Adjusted operating cash ow 1,972 1,742 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION 142 NOTES TO THE SUMMARY COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION IN EUROS Notes to the summary combined financial information in euros 4 Statement of cash ows RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING PROFIT BEFORE JOINT VENTURES TO CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS 2012 2011 m m Operating profit before joint ventures 1,641 1,351 Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 404 408 Amortisation of internally developed intangible assets 186 152 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 93 86 Share based remuneration 38 31 Total non cash items 721 677 Decrease in inventories and pre-publication costs 26 37 Decrease increase in receivables 5 42 Decrease in payables 121 28 Increase in working capital 90 33 Cash generated from operations 2,272 1,995 CASH FLOW ON ACQUISITIONS 2012 2011 m m Purchase of businesses 339 523 Investment in joint ventures 13 1 Deferred payments relating to prior year acquisitions 37 29 Total 389 553 RECONCILIATION OF NET BORROWINGS Related derivative Cash & cash financial equivalents Borrowings instruments 2012 2011 m m m m m At start of year 871 5,138 148 4,119 4,043 Decrease in cash and cash equivalents 89 89 51 Net movement in short term bank loans, overdrafts and commercial paper 534 534 241 Issuance of other loans 728 728 Repayment of other loans 538 538 285 Repayment of finance leases 55 25 Change in net borrowings resulting from cash ows 89 349 260 18 Borrowings in acquired businesses 21 Inception of finance leases 16 16 9 Fair value and other adjustments to borrowings and related derivatives 5 6 1 9 Exchange translation differences 6 23 1 28 73 At end of year 788 4,787 153 3,846 4,119 Net borrowings comprise cash and cash equivalents, loan capital, finance leases, promissory notes, bank and other loans, and those derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge the fair value of xed rate borrowings.
Overview Business review Financial review Governance Financial statements and other information Reed Elsevier Annual Reports and Financial Statements 2012 143 5 Acquisitions During the year a number of acquisitions were made for a total consideration of 419m 2011: 566m, after taking account of net cashacquired of 15m 2011: 28m.
The net assets of the businesses acquired are incorporated at their fair value to the combined businesses.
Provisional fair values of the consideration given and of the assets and liabilities acquired are summarised below.

In addition, goodwill arises on therecognition of deferred tax liabilities in respect of intangible assets for which amortisation does not qualify for tax deductions.
The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional pending the completion of the valuation exercises.
Final fair values will be incorporated in the 2013 combined financial statements.
There were no significant adjustments to the provisional fair values of prior year acquisitions established in 2011.
The businesses acquired in 2012 contributed 90m to revenue, increased adjusted operating profit by 22m, increased adjusted net profit by 17m, decreased reported net profit by 12m, and contributed 2m to net cash inow from operating activities for the part yearunder Reed Elsevier ownership and before taking account of acquisition nancing costs.
Had the businesses been acquired at thebeginning of the year, on a pro forma basis the Reed Elsevier revenues, adjusted operating profit, adjusted net profit and reported netprot for the year would have been 7,568m, 2,112m, 1,405m and 1,320m respectively before taking account of acquisition nancing costs.
