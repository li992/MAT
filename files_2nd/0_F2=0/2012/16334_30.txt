76 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group Notes to accounts Group 31 December 2012 1 Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating segments Aircraft & Vehicle Systems, Information & Power Systems and Tactical & Sonar Systems.
These segments are consistent with the internal reporting as reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer.
Each segment includes businesses with similar operating and market characteristics.

Revenue by destination The following table provides an analysis of the Groups sales by geographical market.
2012 2011 000 000 United Kingdom 225,671 215,227 Continental Europe 55,769 67,882 Canada 19,038 22,123 USA 349,145 333,266 Rest of World 111,203 93,235 760,826 731,733 During the year there was one direct customer 2011: one, that individually accounted for greater than 10% of the Groups total turnover.
Sales to this customer in 2012 were 189.3m 2011: 178m across all segments.
These are calculated as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Operating profit 88,671 99,215 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 32,079 23,133 Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 1,494 232 Underlying operating profit 122,244 122,116 Profit before tax 82,806 91,179 Amortisation of intangibles arising on acquisition 32,079 23,133 Adjustments to contingent consideration net of acquisition costs 1,494 232 Unwinding of discount on provisions see note 26 577 - Profit loss on fair value movements on derivatives 1,390 821 Underlying profit before tax 115,566 114,901 Cash generated by operations see note 29 113,881 149,318 Purchase of property, plant and equipment 20,470 12,099 Proceeds on disposal of property, plant and equipment 67 - Expenditure on product development and other intangibles 4,659 3,055 Dividend from equity accounted investment 765 - Purchase of Long-Term Incentive Plan shares - 422 Operating cash flow 89,584 133,742 Underlying operating profit has been shown before acquisition related costs and the amortisation of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
To maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term, these charges have been excluded from underlying operating profit.
Underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 are also presented before these adjustments.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 79 Notes to accounts Group continued 2 Additional performance measures continued IAS 37 requires the Group to discount provisions using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The liability relates to acquisition deferred consideration, therefore, to maintain a consistent presentation of financial performance over the longer term underlying profit before tax and underlying earnings per share see note 12 are stated before the unwinding of discount on the provision.
IAS 39 requires the Group to fair value the derivative instruments used to manage Ultras foreign exchange exposures.
This creates volatility in the valuation of the outstanding instruments as exchange rates move over time.
This will have minimal impact on profit over the full term of the instruments, but can cause significant volatility on particular balance sheet dates.
Headline profit before tax and headline earnings per share see note 12 are stated before changes in the valuation of foreign currency derivative instruments.
The Group is cash-generative and reinvests funds to support the continuing growth of the business.
It seeks to use an accurate and appropriate measure of the funds generated internally while sustaining this growth.
For this, Ultra uses operating cash flow, rather than cash generated by operations, as its preferred indicator of cash generated and available to cover non-operating expenses such as tax and interest payments.
The Group believes that using cash generated by operations, with the exclusion of net expenditure on property, plant and equipment and outflows for capitalised product development and other intangibles, would result in an under-reporting of the true cash cost of sustaining a growing business.

Introduction 84 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the Cash-Generating Units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
These consist of the Groups operating businesses.
The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
In determining the value-in-use for each CGU, the Group prepares cash flows derived from the most recent financial budgets and strategic plans, representing the best estimate of future performance.
These plans, which have been approved by the Board, include detailed financial forecasts and market analysis covering the expected development of each CGU over the next five years.
The cash flows for the following ten years are also included and assume a growth rate of 2.5% per annum.
Cash flows beyond that period are not included in the value-in-use calculation.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, future revenues, growth rates and forecast gross margins.
Management estimates the discount rate using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group, being the Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The WACC is then risk-adjusted to reflect risks specific to each business.
The pre-tax discount rate used during 2012 varied between 12.3% and 16.0% 2011: 12.3% to 13.3%.
Future revenues are based on orders already received, opportunities that are known and expected at the time of setting the budget and strategic plans and future growth rates.
Budget and strategic plan growth rates are based on a combination of historic experience, available government spending data and management and industry expectations of the growth rates that are expected to apply in the major markets in which each CGU operates.
Longer-term growth rates, applied for the ten year period after the end of the strategic planning period, are set at 2.5%.
Ultra considers the long-term growth rate to be appropriate for the sectors in which it operates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, factor in expected efficiencies to counter inflationary pressures, and also reflect likely margins achievable in the shorter-term period of greater defence spending uncertainty.
Within each of the strategic plans a number of assumptions are made about business growth opportunities, contract wins, product development and available markets.
A key assumption is that there will be continued demand for Ultras products and expertise from a number of US government agencies and prime contractors during the strategic plan period.
Sensitivity analysis has been performed on the value-in-use calculations to: i reduce the post-2017 growth assumption from 2.5% to nil.
ii apply a 10% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows.
iii consider specific market factors as noted above.
Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 85 Notes to accounts Group continued 13 Goodwill continued Certain of these sensitivity scenarios give rise to potential impairments at ProLogic, Adaptive Materials Inc and Criticom.
Headroom for these businesses, which represents the value derived from the key growth assumptions in the value-in-use calculations, is as follows: ProLogic 10.9m, Adaptive Materials Inc 39.0m and Criticom 1.0m.
Sensitivity assumptions i and ii would result in a headroom shortfall at Criticom only of 0.3m and 0.4m respectively.
Sensitivity iii is particularly relevant for ProLogic and Adaptive Materials Inc and accordingly if assumption ii was extended further, a 12% reduction to forecast operating profits in each year of the modelled cash inflows for ProLogic, and a 71% reduction for Adaptive Materials Inc, representing a key programme, would indicate an impairment.
For all other CGUs, the value-in-use calculations comfortably exceed the CGU carrying values in the sensitivity scenarios.
The amortisation of intangible assets charge is included within administrative expenses.
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are amortised over their estimated useful lives, typically as follows: Intellectual property 5 to 10 years Customer relationships 5 to 16 years Development costs 2 to 10 years Software 3 to 5 years Patents and trademarks 10 to 20 years Profit in acquired order book 1 to 3 years 7.
The net book value of plant and machinery held under finance leases was 107,000 2011: 158,000.
Depreciation charged in the year on assets held under finance leases was 52,000 2011: 46,000.
Included within Land and Buildings is 5,137,000 2011: nil of assets in the course of construction which will start to be depreciated during 2013.

All trade receivables that have been overdue for more than a year are provided for in full.
Movement in the provision for trade receivables was as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Balance at beginning of year 1,743 961 Foreign exchange differences 12 1 Increase in provision for trade receivables regarded as potentially uncollectable 412 1,278 Decrease in provision for trade receivables recovered during the year 698 497 Balance at end of year 1,445 1,743 Credit risk Credit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group mitigates this risk of financial loss by only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Whilst the Group has elements of concentration of credit risk, with exposure to a number of largecounter parties and customers, the customers are mainly government agencies or multi-national organisations with whom the Group has long term business relationships.
The Group has a small number of customers with individually significant amounts outstanding.
These customers are considered to have low credit risk.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable and when appropriate action is taken to minimise the Groups credit risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements see note 23 net of any allowances for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.

Introduction 90 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management Derivative financial instruments Exposure to currency and interest rate risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to all significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted unadjusted active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that includes inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All of Ultras financial instruments have been assessed as Level 2.

Liquidity risk The Group maintains committed banking facilities with core banks to provide prudent levels of borrowing headroom.
The Groups banking facilities are provided by a small group of banks, led by The Royal Bank of Scotland.
During the year there were two facilities in place: one, which was replaced in 2011, provides 90 million of revolving credit and expires in January 2016 and a second which was put in place in 2010, providing a further 120 million of revolving credit which expires in September 2013.
Both facilities are denominated in Sterling, US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars and Euros and are used for balance sheet and operational needs.
A further 15 million overdraft is available for short-term working capital funding.
On 13 January 2013 the 120 million facility was replaced by a 100 million facility which expires in December 2017.
All bank loans are unsecured.
Interest was predominantly charged at 1.50% 2011: 1.50% over base or contracted rate.
At 31 December 2012, the Group had available 180,815,000 2011: 129,798,000 of undrawn, committed borrowing facilities.
The Group is strongly cash-generative and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally to fund short-term local working capital requirements.
Where additional funding is required, this is provided centrally through the Groups committed banking facilities.
The Group, through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS, participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Further disclosure is provided in note 24.
In July 2011 the Group negotiated a private shelf agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. which allows the Group to issue loan notes up to a value of $150 million.
Loan notes can be issued up until 3 January 2014 and with a maturity date of up to 10 years.
$10 million of loan notes were issued in 2011 with a maturity date of July 2018, a further $60 million of loan notes were issued in January 2012 with a maturity date of January 2019.
Consequently as at 31 December 2012 $80 million remained available under the shelf agreement.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in Note 22 to the Accounts, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Currency risk The Group uses currency derivatives in the form of forward currency contracts to hedge its foreign currency transaction risk.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars and Canadian dollars.
At 31 December 2012, the net fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an asset of approximately 5,017,000 2011: 3,627,000, comprising 5,606,000 assets 2011: 4,694,000 and 589,000 liabilities 2011: 1,067,000.
The gain on derivative financial instruments included in the Groups consolidated income statement for the period was 1,390,000 2011: loss of 821,000.
The net notional, or net contracted amounts of foreign currency related forward sales contracts, classified by year of maturity are shown below.

The value of the borrowings does not exceed the net investments, meeting the conditions required to qualify as effective hedges.
Interest rate risk The Group has $70 million of long term fixed rate debt with an interest rate of 3.60%.
This was entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure reflecting the Groups policy.
During the prior year the Group used interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings.
The swaps matured in December 2011 and had fixed swap rates, including the bank margin, ranging from 4.40% to 4.78%.
The interest rate swaps were designated effective cash flow hedges and the change in fair value was charged to equity.
The amount recycled from the income statement during the year was nil.
1,702,000 was charged to interest cost in the prior year.
The effective interest rates and repricing dates of the Groups financial assets and liabilities were as follows: Effective Within interest Total 1 year 1 to 2 years 2 to 5 years 5 years rate 000 000 000 000 000 2012 Cash and cash equivalents 0.36% 30,840 30,840 -- - Loan notes 3.60% 43,295 -- - 43,295 Unsecured bank loans 1.94% 27,544 27,544 -- - Government loans 4.43% 2,914 -- - 2,914 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 87 37 30 20 - 2011 Cash and cash equivalents 0.10% 41,051 41,051 -- - Loan notes 4.09% 6,468 -- - 6,468 Unsecured bank loans: US dollar loan 1.79% 78,912 78,912 -- - Government loans 4.43% 1,680 -- - 1,680 Finance lease liabilities 4.89% 139 63 42 34 - Market risk sensitivity analysis Currency risks The Group has estimated the change to the income statement and equity of a 10% and 25% strengthening or weakening of average actual and transactional currency rates applicable during the year and a 10% and 25% change in the foreign exchange rates applicable for valuing foreign exchange derivative instruments.
Introduction 94 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc Notes to accounts Group continued 23 Financial instruments and financial risk management continued Interest rate risk During 2012 the Groups borrowings were predominantly at fixed interest rates, consequently the income statement is not particularly sensitive to a small change in interest rates.
The Group has estimated the change to the income statement of a 1% increase in market interest rates, from the average rates applicable during 2012.
There is no significant difference between the amount recharged to the income statement and equity in the year.
1% change Profit before tax 000 2012 Interest rate sensitivity 386 2011 Interest rate sensitivity 117 24 Government grants and loans The Group through its Canadian subsidiary Ultra Electronics Tactical Communication Systems UETCS participates in two Canadian programmes that provide government support in relation to the development of certain of its products.
Under the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative SADI, the Canadian Federal Government provides a long-term funding arrangement in respect of certain eligible research and development project costs.
Under this arrangement, up to $32m will be provided and reimbursed at favourable rates of interest over the period 2016 - 2030.
The benefit of the below market rate of interest has been calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of the loan and has been credited to profit in the year.
The fair value of the loan has been calculated using a market interest rate for a similar instrument applicable at the time the agreement was signed.
UETCS also participates in the Investissement Quebec IQ research and development programme, whereby IQ shares in the cost of research and development of certain specified new products.
Under this arrangement IQ will finance up to $14m of eligible costs associated with these specified projects.
This funding is repayable under a royalty arrangement over the period 2014 - 2021 if these products are successfully brought to market.
Royalties only become payable when sales of these products are made.
As there is no minimum repayment, funding received in respect of the IQ programme has been included in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of these programmes were as follows: 2012 2011 000 000 Fair value of SADI loan brought forward 1,680 - Contributions 970 1,593 Interest charged to finance costs 327 87 Foreign exchange differences 63 - Fair value of SADI loan carried forward 2,914 1,680 Government grants credited to profit in the year 2012 2011 000 000 SADI 1,841 3,432 IQ 787 1,440 2,628 4,872 Ultra Electronics Holdings plc 95 Notes to accounts Group continued 25 Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting period.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so.
The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of 3.40 million 2011: 2.99 million relating to tax losses, due to uncertainty as to their recoverability.
There are no temporary differences which arise in respect of undistributed earnings.
The main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 25% to 23% from 1 April 2013.
The lower rate of 23% has been used to calculate the deferred tax balances at 31 December 2012 as this rate reduction was enacted before the balance sheet date.
The UK government has also announced its intention to reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 2% per annum to 21% by 1 April 2014.
This further proposed rate reduction has not been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in the financial statements.
The main estimated impact on the balance sheet of the 2% annual reduction will be to reduce the deferred tax asset in respect of retirement benefit obligations by approximately 1.6m.

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Groups share price.
Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 16.15.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 1,912,376 2011: 1,814,728.
The Groups equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value for all schemes other than the LTIP schemes are measured by use of the Black Scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions: Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2012 Weighted average share price 14.31 16.43 16.29 n a Weighted average exercise price 12.40 16.39 16.25 n a Expected volatility % 24.4 25.3 26.2 n a Expected option life years 3.9 6.0 5.0 n a Risk-free interest rate % 2.1 3.0 2.1 n a Expected dividends % 2.1 2.1 2.1 n a Share save CSOP ESOS LTIP 2011 Weighted average share price 14.10 14.06 14.02 n a Weighted average exercise price 12.22 14.19 14.14 n a Expected volatility % 24.4 24.3 25.5 n a Expected option life years 3.8 6.0 5.0 n a Risk-free interest rate % 2.3 2.7 2.5 n a Expected dividends % 2.0 2.1 2.1 n a Figures in the above table show an average across the invested schemes at year end.
For the 2010, 2011 and 2012 LTIP awards, the stochastic model has been used to calculate the fair value of the awards at grant date as this is the most accurate way of modelling the TSR performance condition.
The fair value of these schemes has been calculated using the following assumptions: 2012 2011 Exercise price n a n a Share price at grant 16.24 13.16 Expected option life years 3.0 3.0 Expected volatility % 25.9 28.0 Expected dividend yield % 0.0 0.0 Risk-free interest rate % 1.6 2.1 Figures in the above table show an average across the schemes.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 4.45 2011: 4.53.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options was 3.4 years 2011: 3.4 years.

The scheme was closed to new members in 2003.
A new defined contribution plan was introduced for other employees and new joiners in the UK.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2010.
The Group also operates two defined contribution schemes for overseas employees.
In addition to these schemes, the Groups Tactical Communication Systems business based in Montreal, Canada, has three defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The total cost charged to income in respect of the defined contribution schemes was 5,889,000 2011: 5,076,000.
Defined benefit schemes The UK defined benefit scheme was actuarially assessed at 31 December 2012 using the projected unit method.
The Canadian defined benefit schemes were actuarially assessed at 31 December 2012 using the projected unit method.
Key financial assumptions used in the valuation of these schemes were as follows: UK Canada UK Canada 2012 2012 2011 2011 Discount rate 4.70% 4.70% 5.0% 5.0% Inflation rate RPI 2.85% 2.85% 3.0% 3.0% Inflation rate CPI 2.05% n a 2.2% n a Expected rate of salary increases 3.35% 3.35% 3.5% 3.5% Future pension increases pre 6 4 08 2.75% 2.85% 3.0% 2.7% Future pension increases post 6 4 08 1.85% n a 2.2% n a For each of these assumptions there is a range of possible values.
Relatively small changes in some of these variables can have a significant impact on the level of the total obligation.
For the UK scheme, a 0.1% reduction in the inflation assumption to 2.75% and a 0.1% increase in the discount rate to 4.8% would decrease the schemes liabilities by 1.8% and 1.7% respectively.
If the members life expectancy were to increase by 1 year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 2.9%.
The key demographic assumption used was in relation to the mortality rates of current and future pensioners.
Due to the size of the scheme the mortality rates were based on standard tables, namely: Current pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 Future pensioners 95% SAPS S1PMA 105% SAPS S1PFA c2002 MC1% imps from 2002 The mortality assumptions used in the valuation of the UK scheme make appropriate allowance for future improvements in longevity and are set out below: 2012 2011 Current pensioners at 65 males 22 years 22 years Current pensioners at 65 females 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 males 24 years 24 years Future pensioners at 65 females 25 years 25 years Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes were as follows: UK Canada Total UK Canada Total 2012 2012 2012 2011 2011 2011 m m m m m m Past service cost -- - - 0.4 0.4 Current service cost 5.2 0.2 5.4 5.5 0.3 5.8 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 11.0 0.6 11.6 11.7 0.5 12.2 Expected return on pension scheme assets 9.6 0.7 10.3 9.7 0.5 10.2 6.6 0.1 6.7 7.5 0.7 8.2 The prior year past service cost related to the enhancement of cash commutation factors.
