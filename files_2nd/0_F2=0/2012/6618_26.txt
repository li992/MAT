coPPeR equivAleNt Glencore has adopted a copper equivalent measure to assist in analysing and evaluating across its varied commodity portfolio.
The copper equivalent measure is determined by multiplying the volumes of the respective commodity produced or marketed by the ratio of the respective commoditys average price over the average copper price in the prevailing period.
ReAdily mARketAble iNveNtoRieS Readily marketable inventories are readily convertible into cash due to their very liquid nature, widely available markets and the fact that the price risk is or could be covered either by a physical sale transaction or hedge transaction on a commodity exchange or with a highly rated counterparty.
