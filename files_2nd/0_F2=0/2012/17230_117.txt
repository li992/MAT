90 Financial statements Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 29 January 2012 26 Share-based payments continued ii Sharesave scheme The Sharesave scheme has been in operation since May 2000 and all employees including Executive Directors are eligible once the necessary service requirements have been met.
The scheme allows participants to save up to a maximum of 250 each month for a fixed period of three years.
Options are offered at a discount of 20% to the mid-market closing price on the day prior to the offer and are exercisable for a period of six months commencing after the end of the fixed period of the contract.
The exercise of options under this scheme is only subject to service conditions and is equity-settled.
The scheme launched in May 2011 and is under the new scheme rules, approved by the shareholders in June 2010.
Options which have been granted to those eligible employees, including Directors, who chose to participate in the scheme have been fair valued using a binomial stochastic option pricing model.
The fair value of options granted and the assumptions were as follows: Grant date 17 May 2011 18 May 2010 14 May 2009 18 May 2007 Share price at grant date 3.01 2.70 2.43 3.26 Fair value of options granted 11.5m 9.7m 17.4m 12.3m Exercise price 2.28 2.37 1.98 2.47 Dividend yield 3.20% 3.04% 2.38% 1.23% Annual risk free interest rate 1.65% 1.63% 2.10% 5.58% Expected volatility 24.2% 26.5% 28.0% 23.5% The volatility measured at the standard deviation of expected share price returns is based on statistical analysis on weekly share prices over the past 3.37 years prior to the date of grant.
The requirement that the employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the binomial stochastic option pricing model using the assumptions disclosed above.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

The awards are free share-based awards, with non-market vesting conditions attached, that accrue the value of dividends over the vesting period.
The maximum total market value of shares over which awards may be granted to any employee during any financial year of the Company is 300% of salary.
Awards normally vest three years after the original grant date, provided the relevant performance criteria have been met.
The fair value at the date of grant, which is being charged to profit for the period over the three year vesting period, has been calculated based on the following assumptions: 1 Oct 18 Apr 14 Oct 22 Apr 29 Jan 20 Oct 9 Apr 14 Oct 14 Apr Grant date 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2009 2009 2008 2008 Share price at grant date 3.02 2.85 2.96 2.97 2.93 2.71 2.50 2.42 2.77 Assumed leavers 5% 5% 8% 8% 5% 5% 5% 5% Performance criteria 77% 77% 80% 80% 90% 90% 90% 90% 90% Fair value of share awards granted 1.4m 23.3m 1.1m 14.4m 1.1m 1.0m 18.8m 0.6m 12.5m 2012 2011 Share Share awards awards thousands thousands Movement in outstanding share awards Outstanding at start of period 19,725 17,976 Granted 8,651 7,862 Exercised 4,258 3,423 Forfeited 1,412 2,690 Outstanding at end of period 22,706 19,725 Exercisable at end of period 2012 2011 Share awards outstanding at the end of the period Weighted average remaining contractual life 1.8 years 1.4 years
