In July 2010, the UK government announced that CPI should be used as the basis for statutory minimum pension increases.
The impact of the change to CPI from RPI for the UK plan, where the pension rules mandate inflation according to the deemed statutory index, was a credit to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and Expenditure of 1.0m 2011: 2.5m.
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has recently conducted an asset-liability review for its defined benefit pension scheme.
The results of this review are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of the liabilities of the scheme.
They are also used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the defined benefit deficit by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
As a consequence, the Group will be giving more emphasis to a closer return matching of scheme assets and liabilities, both to ensure the long-term security of our defined benefit commitment and to reduce earnings and balance sheet volatility.
The five-year history of experience adjustments was as follows.

The levels of contributions are based on the current service cost and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group estimates the scheme liabilities on average to fall due over 19 and 27 years, respectively, for the Halma and Apollo plans.
