98 Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and reportable business unit.
A summary of the 2012 goodwill allocation by reportable segment is shown below: North Asia 2012 2011 UK Europe America Pacific Africa Total Total m m m m m m m Textiles & Hygiene 52.1 54.8 106.9 112.1 Pest Control 8.7 38.5 93.2 1.3 0.2 141.9 125.6 Asia 27.8 27.8 29.2 City Link Initial Facilities 28.4 28.4 22.1 31 December 2012 37.1 90.6 93.2 83.9 0.2 305.0 31 December 2011 30.8 94.4 78.1 85.5 0.2 289.0 Key assumptions The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections and fair value less costs to sell if appropriate.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and long-range plans approved by management and the board covering a three-year period which are prepared as part of the groups normal planning process.
Cash flows for years four and five use managements expectation of sales growth, operating costs and margin, based on past experience and expectations regarding future performance and profitability for each CGU.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates.
The key assumptions used by individual CGUs for value-in-use calculations were long-term growth rates of between 2% and 4% 2011: 2% and 3% and pre-tax discount rates of between 10% and 11% 2011: 10% and 13%.
The growth rates used by individual CGUs are based on the long-term growth rates predicted for the relevant sector and country in which a business operates.
They do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for that industry or country.
The pre-tax discount rates are based on the groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specific risks relating to the relevant sector and country.
Impairment charges 2012 2011 m m Textiles & Hygiene Europe 1.1 Asia 1.3 2.3 City Link 108.1 1.3 111.5 All impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement within operating expenses.
The City Link impairment charge of 108.1 million in 2011 was triggered by reduced actual and forecast future cash flows with City Link struggling in 2011 to take out operating costs in line with revenue and volume decline.
There is no remaining City Link goodwill.
Apart from the impaired business in Asia, which is not considered material to the group, all other CGUs are not considered to be sensitive to changes in inputs.
