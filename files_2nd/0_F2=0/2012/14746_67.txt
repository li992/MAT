EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS AND CERTAIN REMEASUREMENTS i Exceptional items In the year to 31 March 2012, the following exceptional items were recorded: Impairment of Generation-related assets arising from changing market conditions.

These were recognised as a result of the long-term view of spark spreads at Medway and Keadby, which will change the way the plants are operationally configured.
In addition, further impairment charges in respect of the station running hours at Ferrybridge and in respect of the future prospects for the European wind portfolio were recognised.
Carbon dioxide emissions allowances intangible assets purchased to cover the future emissions liabilities at the Groups thermal plants have been impaired based on current market prices.
Exceptional charges have been recognised in relation to goodwill 30.0m, note 14, property, plant and equipment 30.0m and intangible assets 22.0m.
These were recognised following the goodwill impairment review of the Gas Storage CGU and as a result from changing operational conditions and updated development expectations associated with legacy Metering assets and North Sea exploration assets.

Exceptional charges have been recognised in relation to commodity contracts associated with thermal Generation assets 37.4m.
In addition, costs associated with Retail restructuring and other charges and the impairment of other financial assets 35.6m have been recognised as exceptional in the year.
Changes in UK corporation tax rates.
The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate would reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
The first changes from 28% to 27% and, after the March 2011 Budget, accelerated to 26% had been substantively enacted and applied by 1 April 2011.
The March 2012 Budget confirmed a further acceleration of the reduction in rate to 24% effective from 1 April 2012, this being substantively enacted on 26 March 2012, with a revised rate of 22% expected to be enacted by 2014.
These changes will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
As the rate change to 24% has been substantively enacted it has the effect of reducing the Groups net deferred tax liabilities recognised at 31 March 2012 by 45.7m 2011 49.4m.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2% rate reduction due to legislation not being enacted, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax liabilities assets accordingly.
In addition, in the previous year, the March 2011 Budget increased the rate of supplementary corporation tax SCT from 20% to 32%.
This had been substantively enacted on 29 March 2011.
This had the effect of increasing the Groups deferred tax liabilities and assets in relation to the Groups Gas Production business to which this supplementary tax applies.
The impact on the Groups net deferred tax liabilities was an increase of 31.7m.
