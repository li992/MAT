170 Tullow Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 h Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20- Share-based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of that standard, only those awards that were granted after 7 November 2002, and had not vested at 1 January 2005, are included.
All share-based awards of the Company are equity settled as defined by FRS 20.
The fair value of these awards has been determined at the date of grant of the award allowing for the effect of any market-based performance conditions.
This fair value, adjusted by the Companys estimate of the number of awards that will eventually vest as a result of non-market conditions, is expensed uniformly over the vesting period.
The fair values were calculated using a binomial option pricing model with suitable modifications to allow for employee turnover after vesting and early exercise.
Where necessary this model was supplemented with a Monte Carlo model.
The inputs to the models include: the share price at date of grant: exercise price: expected volatility: expected dividends: risk-free rate of interest: and patterns of exercise of the plan participants.
i Capital management The Company defines capital as the total equity of the Company.
Capital is managed in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits to stakeholders and to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.
Tullow is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, and put in place new debt facilities.

172 Tullow Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 The Company is required to assess the carrying values of each of its investments in subsidiaries for impairment.
The net assets of certain of the Companys subsidiaries are predominantly intangible exploration and evaluation E&E assets.
Where facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an E&E asset held by a subsidiary may exceed its recoverable amount, by reference to the specific indicators of impairment of E&E assets, an impairment test of the asset is performed by the subsidiary undertaking and the asset is impaired by any difference between its carrying value and its recoverable amount.
The recognition of such an impairment by a subsidiary is used by the Company as the primary basis for determining whether or not there are indications that the investment in the related subsidiary may also be impaired, and thus whether an impairment test of the investment carrying value needs to be performed.
The results of exploration activities are inherently uncertain, and the assessment for impairment of E&E assets by the subsidiary, and that of the related investment by the Company, is judgemental.

A deferred tax asset of $nil million 2011: $nil million has been recognised in respect of these losses on the basis that the Company does not anticipate making non-ring-fenced profits in the foreseeable future.

Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to market rates.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility, which was refinanced in November 2012, incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The outstanding debt is repayable in line with the amortisation of bank commitments over the period to the final maturity date of 7 November 2019, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
The $500 million Revolving credit facility is repayable in full on 31 December 2014.
The facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at US dollar LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
At the end of December 2012, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $2,202 million: $1,702 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit facility: and $500 million under the Revolving credit facility.
At the end of December 2011, the headroom under the two facilities amounted to $826 million: $176 million under the $3.5 billion Reserves Based Lending credit 174 Tullow Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Accounts FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5 facility and $650 million under the Revolving credit facility.
The increase in headroom is as a result of repayment of the Reserves Based Lending credit facility with proceeds from the Uganda farm-down.
The Company is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate swaps.
The mark-to-market position of the Groups interest rate portfolio as at 31 December 2012 is a liability of $2.9 million 2011: $7.0 million liability.
Interest rate hedges are included in fixed rate debt in the above table.
As at 31 December 2012, the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Company that were not denominated in its functional currency were 106.0 million cash drawings under the Groups borrowing facilities 2011: 106.0 million.
The carrying amounts of the Companys foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are net liabilities of $171.6 million 2011: net liabilities of $163.8 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Company is mainly exposed to currency fluctuations against the US dollar.
The Company measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including assessing the impact of reasonably possible movements in key variables.
The sensitivity analyses includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 20% change in foreign currency rates.
As at 31 December 2012, a 20% increase in foreign exchange rates against the US dollar would have resulted in a decrease in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $28.5 million 2011: $27.3 million while a 20% decrease would have resulted in an increase in foreign currency denominated liabilities and equity of $34.3 million 2011: $32.8 million.
