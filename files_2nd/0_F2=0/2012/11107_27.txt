By order of the Board andrew McKinlay, Secretary Registered Office: Desford Road, Enderby, leicester, lE19 4aT 17 april 2012 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 28 January 2012 94 21127-04 05 04 2012 Proof 5 21127-04NEXTPLC.
indd 94 10 04 2012 10:17:40 aPPEnDix 1 fuRTHER infORMaTiOn On RESOluTiOn 17: Off-MaRKET PuRCHaSES Of Own SHaRES As noted on pages 20 to 21 in the Directors Report and Business Review, approval will be sought from shareholders to renew the Companys authority to make off-market purchases of its shares.
By virtue of special resolution number 16 passed at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM on 19 May 2011 shareholder authority was given to the Company to make on-market purchases of shares.
This authority was limited to a maximum of 26.97 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM held in 2012 or 1 August 2012.
At the same AGM, authority was granted to the Company to make off-market purchases of shares for cancellation under contingent purchase contracts to be entered into with each of Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Bank plc the Bank s. This authority was limited to a maximum of 9 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM to be held in 2012 or 1 August 2012.
Since the granting of those authorities and up to 20 March 2012, the Company has bought back 6,298,926 shares for cancellation, representing 3.6% of its issued share capital as at the date of the 2011 AGM, at a total cost of 157.9 million.
Of these, 950,000 shares were bought back under contingent purchase contracts.
Under Sections 693 and 694 of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, the Company is not permitted to make off-market purchases or contingent purchases of its shares unless it obtains advance shareholder approval to the proposed contract terms.
Furthermore, under the rules of the UK Listing Authority the Listing Rules the Company may not purchase its shares at a time when any director is in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information about the Company.
Accordingly, no purchases of shares would normally be made in periods when the directors might be in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information Close Periods.
Typically, these include the periods from the Companys half year end up to the announcement of its interim results in September and the January year end up to the announcement of full year results in March each year.
These Close Periods inevitably reduce the number of shares the Company is able to purchase.
In order to achieve maximum flexibility in its share purchase activities, the Company is able to enter into irrevocable and nondiscretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during Close Periods.
Another method of providing flexibility in its share purchase activities, and reducing the cost of share buybacks, is for the Company to enter into contingent forward purchase contracts outside of Close Periods.
Pursuant to the authority granted at the 2011 AGM, the Company entered into agreements with the Banks the Existing Agreements and the Company intends to terminate the Existing Agreements and enter into new agreements with each of the Banks and HSBC Bank plc together the New Banks.
Under these agreements the Programme Agreements, the Company may although it is not obliged to enter into contingent forward trades Contingent Forward Trades or CFT from time to time.
The terms of each CFT will provide for the Company to purchase a fixed number of shares each week over a period of between 20 to 30 weeks.
The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under each CFT is limited to 50,000 shares per week.
Details of each CFT will be announced to shareholders on the day it is entered into by the Company.
Whether or not the Company purchases shares in a particular week during the term of a CFT is dependent upon the Companys share price not reaching a level set at the time that contract is entered into the Suspension Level.
The Suspension Level is determined by the Company and must be between 104% and 110% of the Companys share price as at the start of the CFT.
The price at which the Company may purchase shares during the term of a Contingent Forward Trade the Forward Price shall also be fixed at the start of the CFT.
The Forward Price is subject to a maximum of 99% of the share price at the start of the contract and a minimum of 10 pence the par value of an ordinary share.
This structure would allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price as at the time each CFT commences, for so long as the Suspension Level is not reached, without breaching the Listing Rules.
If the Suspension Level is reached, the CFT would terminate automatically at that time and no further shares would be purchased under that contract.
In such circumstances, a reduced number of shares would be purchased by the Company for cancellation under that contract.
Under the provisions of Sections 693 and 694 of the Act, the Programme Agreements and Contingent Forward Trades are contingent purchase contracts to purchase shares by the Company off-market.
Accordingly resolution 17, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks shareholder approval to the terms of the Programme Agreements to be entered into between the Company and each of the New Banks.
The Programme Agreements will have a duration of the shorter of the period to the date of the next AGM to be held in 2013 or 1 August 2013 and will incorporate the terms of an ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule.
The Programme Agreements will be entered into and each CFT will be effected outside a Close Period but shares may be purchased during a Close Period by the Company.
The minimum and maximum amount of time between a CFT being effected and shares being purchased is 5 days and 30 weeks respectively.

indd 95 10 04 2012 10:17:40 Additional information Notes to the accounts Accounts Governance Business reports Additional information notice of Meeting Should shareholder approval be granted, any number of CFT may be effected with the New Banks at any time, provided that: the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would be 8.0 million, representing less than 5% of its issued share capital at 20 March 2012: the total cost of shares that the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority may not exceed 200 million including costs : the Forward Price may not exceed the higher of 105% of the average middle market closing price of the Companys shares as derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five days immediately preceding the day on which the Contingent Forward Trade was effected and the amount stipulated by Article 5 1 of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003: the Forward Price will be no more than 99% of the share price at the time the Contingent Forward Trade was effected: the minimum price that can be paid for any share is 0.10: and only one Contingent Forward Trade will be entered into on any particular day.
Subject to the limits set out above, the Company will select the Suspension Level and the duration of each CFT, and the Forward Price will be determined by the relevant New Bank.
Shares purchased via the Programme Agreements will reduce the number of shares that the Company may purchase under any authority granted at the AGM on 17 May 2012 for on-market purchases.
No shares will be purchased under that authority on the same day that a CFT is entered into.
The authority granted to the Company under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2013 or on 1 August 2013, whichever is the earlier, unless such authority is renewed prior to that time except in relation to the purchase of shares under any CFT effected before the expiry of such authority and which might be completed wholly or partly after such expiry.
The purchase of shares under the Programme Agreements will always be physically settled by delivery of shares to the Company except in the case of certain events of default or termination events.
A copy of each of the Programme Agreements will be available at the AGM on 17 May 2012.
Copies will also be available for inspection at the Companys registered office at Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester LE19 4AT or at the offices of Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London, E1 6AD during usual business hours until the date of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 20 March 2012 was 9,724,138.
This represents 5.8% of the issued share capital at that date.
If the Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority for off-market purchases granted at the 2011 AGM which will expire at the 2012 AGM and the authority sought by this special resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 20 March 2012 would represent 6.4% of the reduced issued share capital.

indd 96 10 04 2012 10:17:40 attendance, voting and questions All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting AGM.
A member who is entitled to attend and vote may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote instead of him, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him.
A proxy need not also be a member.
A proxy may vote on any other business which may properly come before the meeting.
If you do not intend being present at the meeting please either sign and return a hard copy form of proxy so as to reach the Companys registrars at least 48 hours before the meeting or follow the instructions for electronic proxy appointment through CREST or through www.
The return by a member of a fully completed form of proxy will not preclude any such member from attending in person and voting at the meeting.
A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights a Nominated Person may, under an agreement between them and the shareholder by whom they were nominated, have a right to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the AGM.
If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statements of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in the above paragraph and in the paragraphs headed Electronic proxy appointment through CREST and Proxy card below do not apply to a Nominated Person.
The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered members of the Company.
Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares and not the Company on matters relating to their investments in the Company.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and its articles of association, specifies that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6pm on 15 May 2012 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid general meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after 6pm on 15 May 2012 or 6pm on the day that is two days before any adjourned meeting shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.

This means that the votes of all shareholders, including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, are counted.
The procedures for the poll votes will be explained at the AGM.

Therefore, NEXT intends to disregard any poll votes which are cast in favour of resolution 17 attaching to 8.0 million shares being the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to the Programme Agreements from both the total number of votes cast in favour of this resolution and the total number of votes cast.
As at 20 March 2012 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice the Companys issued share capital consists of 168,147,532 ordinary shares.
All of the ordinary shares carry one vote each and there are no shares held in treasury.
