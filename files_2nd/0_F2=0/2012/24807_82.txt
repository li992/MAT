Credit Risk continued Credit Risk Exposure The exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: 2012 2011 000 000 Fixed interest investments 31,831 26,236 Cash and short term deposits 28,950 30,021 Debtors and prepayments 1,985 1,947 62,766 58,204 The maximum exposure in fixed interest investments was 33,170,000 2011 30,587,000 and the minimum 26,228,000 2011 20,059,000.
None of the Companys financial assets are past due or impaired.
C. Liquidity Risk The Companys policy with regard to liquidity is to provide a degree of flexibility so that the portfolio can be repositioned when appropriate and that most of the assets can be realised without an excessive discount to the market price.
a Equity Securities The Companys unlisted investments are not readily realisable, but these only amount to 2.1% of the Companys total assets at 31 December 2012 2011 1.8%.
In practice, liquidity in investee companies is imperfect, particularly those with a market value of less than 100 million.
To reduce this liquidity risk it is the policy to diversify the holdings and generally to restrict the holding in any one company to less than 10% of the share capital of that company.
Furthermore the guideline is for no single investment to account for more than 5% of the assets of the Company.
The market valuation of each underlying security gives an indication of value, but the price at which an investment can be made or realised can diverge materially from the bid or offer price depending on market conditions generally and particularly to each investment.
34% 182 million 2011 34% 168 million of the portfolio is invested in listed stocks with a market capitalisation below 100 million, where liquidity is expected to be more limited.
If these stocks had on average a realisable value 20% below the bid price the value of the total fund would be adversely affected by 6.7% 2011 6.9%.
b Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap The fair value of the swap is estimated by RBS the provider of the swap and is compared to an external model and external prices.
We believe the RBS valuation to be reasonable.
The RBS valuation methodology and assumptions may change at any time.
The swap valuation gives an indication of fair value, but the price at which the swap can be unwound or realised may diverge materially from this valuation depending on market conditions and liquidity.
Liquidity Risk Exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2012 2011 One year One year or less or less 000 000 Bank loans 50,492 51,727 Derivative financial instruments 24,136 25,725 Other creditors 470 444 75,098 77,896 52 notes to tHe FInAnCIAL stAteMents continued 20.
Financial instruments continued Fair value of Financial Instruments Fair values are measured using the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1: reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables includes only data from observable markets.
Level 3: reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the accounting policies on pages 40 and 41.
The tables below set out the fair value measurements using the fair value hierarchy.
