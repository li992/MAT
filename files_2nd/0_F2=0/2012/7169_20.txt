75 financial statements 4 SeGmentAl InFormAtIon Adoption of IFrS 8, operating Segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified onthebasis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
As a result the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and UnitedKingdom & Ireland.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 6.

Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates.
The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management, and management uses estimated pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% 2011: 3.0%, reflecting long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12.5% 2011: 12.0%.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs towhich goodwill has been allocated.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management and included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in long-term growth rate between 0% and 5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: In s million 2012 2011 Asia Pacific 25.4 24.5 Continental Europe & Rest of World 58.7 65.9 United Kingdom & Ireland 93.1 93.1 177.2 183.5 82 Hays PLC AnnuAl RepoRt & FinAnciAl StAtementS 2012 noteS to the ConSolIdAted FInAnCIAl StAtementS continued 15 other IntAnGIble ASSetS In s million 2012 2011 Cost At 1 July 87.1 75.0 Exchange adjustments 0.5 0.7 Additions 6.1 11.7 Disposals 6.5 0.3 At 30 June 86.2 87.1 Amortisation At 1 July 24.2 12.9 Exchange adjustments 0.5 0.6 Charge for year 13.5 10.9 Disposals 6.5 0.2 At 30 June 30.7 24.2 Net book value At 30 June 55.5 62.9 At 1 July 62.9 62.1 All other intangible assets relate to computer software.

Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 30 June 2012 the Group had drawn down 170 million 2011: 185 million from its unsecured revolving credit facility.
In the prior year, the Group entered into interest rate derivatives topartially hedge this risk.

Committed facilities The Group has an unsecured revolving credit facility of 300 million which expires in January 2014.
The financial covenants under the existing facility require the Groups interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rateof the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%.

Capital management The Boards current priorities for the Groups free cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the Balance Sheet and tosupport a sustainable dividend policy.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.

The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
a uk defined Contribution Scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001 and replaced by the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan in March 2012 together the money purchase arrangements.
Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level ofemployee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 3.4 million 2011: 3.0 million represents employers contributions payable tothe money purchase arrangements.
Contributions of 0.3 million 2011: 0.3 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the money purchase arrangements are held separately from those of the Group.
b uk defined benefit Schemes i T he Hays Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme which is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii T he Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who weresubject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
On 30 June 2012 the Group closed its UK defined benefit pension schemes to the accrual of future benefits.
The closure resulted in a curtailment gain of 6.0 million which has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement see note 6.
Employees in these schemesbecame eligible to join the Hays Group Personal Pension Plan.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is carried out every three years.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 150 million and a revised deficit funding schedule of 12 million per annum, subject to 3% per annum fixed uplift over a 12-year period, was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010.
During the year the Group made a contribution of 12.4 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2011: 12.0 million in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2012 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, who is an employee of Hymans Robertson LLP.
The key assumptions used at30June 2012 are listed below.
IAS 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The principal long-term assumptions are as follows: % 2012 2011 RPI inflation 3.3 3.6 CPI inflation 2.6 2.9 Discount rate 5.0 5.5 Rate of increase in salaries n a 3.9 Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.3 3.6 Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 5.0 6.1 89 financial statements The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return foreach asset class and the proportions of each asset class held at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return onpension scheme assets within the net finance charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1nA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin tofuture improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments minus 0.5 years for male pensioners.

The actuarial loss due to changes in assumptions comprises a gain on account of higher than expected asset returns being offset by a loss due to the decrease in the net yield discount rate versus RPI inflation rate.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected return at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date was as follows: 2012 2011 2012 expected 2011 Expected Fair value return Fair value return s million % s million % Equities 176.2 6.6 224.7 7.3 Bonds and gilts 166.6 3.6 198.2 4.9 Other assets 133.3 4.5 17.6 0.5 476.1 5.0 440.5 6.1 Other assets as at 30 June 2012 comprise a mix of absolute return funds, property, LDI funds and cash.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to 30 June 2012, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the rate of return on AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class at 30 June 2011.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation todevelop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 6.1% assumption forthe year ended 30 June 2012.
