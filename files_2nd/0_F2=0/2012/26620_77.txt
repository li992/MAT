The difference between the amount repayable at maturity on the borrowings and the carrying value is amortised over the period up to the expected maturity of the associated debt in accordance with the effective interest method.
At 31 December 2012, the fair value of borrowings was $826 million.

On any coupon date the Group may exchange or vary the capital securities for qualifying non-innovative tier 1 securities e. g. perpetual non-cumulative preference shares.

Banks with participations totalling $1,320 million accepted the request and as a result $205 million of the facility is currently scheduled to mature in July 2016 and $1,320 million in July 2017.
