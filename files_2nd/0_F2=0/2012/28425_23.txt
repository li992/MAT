The Company adopted the Amendment to FRS 29 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets in 2012.

3 Signifi cant accounting policies Shares in subsidiary undertakings Shares in subsidiary undertakings are shown at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value.
Loans to subsidiary undertakings Loans to subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost, less provisions.
Derivatives Derivative financial instruments are held to manage interest rate and currency pro les.
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value included in the pro t and loss account.
Under FRS 26, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedge accounting is permissible only if certain criteria are met regarding the establishment of documentation and continued measurement of hedge effectiveness.
For derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, the movements in the fair value are recorded in the pro t and loss account with the accompanying change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs, and subsequently accounted for on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.
Under the effective interest method, the difference between the redemption value of the borrowing and the initial proceeds, net of transaction costs, is amortised through the pro t and loss account to the date of maturity, or, for hybrid debt, over the expected life of the instrument.
Dividends Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Share premium The difference between the proceeds received on issue of shares and the nominal value of the shares issued is credited to the share premium account.
Parent company Financial statements Notes on the parent company fi financial statements Prudential plc Annual Report 2012 317 Foreign currency translation Foreign currency borrowings that have been used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries are translated at year end exchange rates.
The impact of these currency translations is recorded within the pro t and loss account for the year.
Other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are also converted at year end exchange rates with the related foreign currency exchange gains or losses re ected in the pro t and loss account for the year.
Tax Current tax expense is charged or credited to operations based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable operations for the current year.
To the extent that losses of an individual UK company are not offset in any one year, they can be carried back for one year or carried forward inde nitely to be offset against pro ts arising from the same company.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised in accordance with the provisions of FRS 19, Deferred tax.
The Company has chosen not to apply the option available of recognising such assets and liabilities on a discounted basis to re ect the time value of money.
Except as set out in FRS 19, deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The Groups UK subsidiaries each le separate tax returns.
In accordance with UK tax legislation, where one domestic UK company is a 75 per cent owned subsidiary of another UK company or both are 75 per cent owned subsidiaries of a common parent, the companies are considered to be within the same UK tax group.
For companies within the same tax group, trading pro ts and losses arising in the same accounting period may be offset for the purposes of determining current and deferred taxes.
Pensions The Company assumes a portion of the pension surplus or fide cit of the Groups main pension scheme, the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and applied the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Bene ts as amended in December 2006 to its interest in the PSPS surplus or fide cit.
Further details are disclosed in note 9.
A pension surplus or fide cit is recorded as the difference between the present value of the scheme liabilities and the fair value of the scheme assets.
The Companys share of pension surplus is recognised to the extent that the Company is able to recover a surplus either through reduced contributions in the future or through refunds from the scheme.
The assets and liabilities of the fide ned bene t pension schemes of the Prudential Group are subject to a full triennial actuarial valuation using the projected unit method.
Estimated future cash ows are then discounted at a high quality corporate bond rate, adjusted to allow for the difference in duration between the bond index and the pension liabilities where appropriate, to determine its present value.
These calculations are performed by independent actuaries.
The aggregate of the actuarially determined service costs of the currently employed personnel and the unwind of the discount on liabilities at the start of the period, gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, less the expected investment return on the scheme assets at the start of the period, is recognised in the pro t and loss account.
To the extent that part or all of the Companys interest in the pension surplus is not recognised as an asset, the unrecognised surplus is initially applied to extinguish any past service costs, losses on settlements or curtailments that would otherwise be included in the pro t and loss account.
Next, the expected investment return on the schemes assets is restricted so that it does not exceed the total of the current service cost, interest cost and any increase in the recoverable surplus.
Any further adjustment for the unrecognised surplus is treated as an actuarial gain or loss.
Actuarial gains and losses as a result of the changes in assumptions, the difference between actual and expected investment return on scheme assets and experience variances are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains and losses also include adjustment for unrecognised pension surplus as described above.
Share-based payments The Group offers share award and option plans for certain key employees and a SAYE plan for all UK and certain overseas employees.
The share-based payment plans operated by the Group are mainly equity-settled plans with a few cash-settled plans.
Under FRS 20, Share-based payment, where the Company, as the parent company, has the obligation to settle the options or awards of its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary undertakings, and such share-based payments are accounted for as equity-settled in the Group financial statements, the Company records an increase in the investment in subsidiary undertakings for the value of the share options and awards granted with a corresponding credit entry recognised directly in equity.
The value of the share options and awards granted is based upon the fair value of the options and awards at the grant date, the vesting period and the vesting conditions.

9 Pension scheme fi financial position The majority of UK Prudential staff are members of the Groups pension schemes.
The largest scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme the Scheme which is primarily a closed fide ned bene t scheme.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the Group applies IFRS basis accounting including IAS 19, Employee Bene ts as described further in note I3 Staff and pension plans of the Group financial statements note I3.
Although the individual accounts of the Company continue to follow UK GAAP, the disclosures under FRS 17, Retirement Bene ts are aligned with IAS 19.
At 31 December 2005, the allocation of surpluses and fide cits attaching to the Scheme between the Company and the unallocated surplus of the The Prudential Assurance Company Limited PAC with-pro ts fund was apportioned in the ratio 30 70 following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base fide cit position at 1 January 2006 and for the purpose of determining the allocation of the movements in that position up to 31 December 2012.
The FRS 17 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
The last completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was as at 5 April 2011.
Further details on the results of this valuation and the total employer contributions to the Scheme for the year are provided in note I3, together with the key assumptions adopted, including mortality assumptions.
Using external actuarial advice provided by the professionally quali ed actuaries, Towers Watson, for the valuation of the Scheme, the most recent full valuations have been updated to 31 December 2012 applying the principles prescribed by FRS 17.

In 2012, the actuarial losses attributable to the Company included an amount credited of 124 million 2011: amount charged of 268 million for the adjustment to the unrecognised portion of surplus which has not been deducted from the pension charge.

11 Profi t of the Company and reconciliation of the movement in shareholders funds The loss after tax of the Company for the year was 216 million 2011: pro t of 3,720 million.
After dividends of 655 million 2011: 642 million, actuarial gains net of tax in respect of the pension scheme of 27 million 2011: losses of 12 million and share-based payment credits of 6 million 2011: 7 million, retained pro t at 31 December 2012 amounted to 4,519 million 2011: 5,357 million.
Retained pro t includes 2,734 million relating to gains made by an intermediate holding company following the transfer at fair value of certain of its subsidiaries to other parts of the Group as part of an internal restructuring exercise in 2011.
Because the gains relate to intragroup transactions, the amount of 2,734 million is not able to be regarded as part of the distributable reserves of the parent company.
Under English company law, Prudential may pay dividends only if suf cient distributable reserves of the Company are available for the purpose and if the amount of its net assets is greater than the aggregate of its called up share capital and undistributable reserves such as for example the share premium account and the payment of the dividend does not reduce the amount of its net assets to less than that aggregate.
At 31 December 2012, the UK GAAP retained earnings of the holding company from which distributable reserves may be derived were 4,519 million.
