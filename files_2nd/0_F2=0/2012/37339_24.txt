Segmental information Management has determined the Groups operating segments based on the information reviewed by the Senior Management Board SMB to make strategic decisions.
The SMB consists of the three executive directors.
All the Groups operations are in the UK and are organised into two business segments against which the Group reports its segmental information, being Retail Portfolio and London Portfolio.
The London Portfolio includes all our London offices and Central London retail excluding assets held in the Metro Shopping Fund Limited Partnership joint venture and the Retail Portfolio includes all our shopping centres, shops, retail warehouse properties, the Accor hotel portfolio and assets held in retail joint ventures, excluding Central London retail.
The information and reports reviewed by the SMB are prepared on a combined portfolio basis, which includes the Groups share of joint ventures on a proportionately consolidated basis.
The following segmental information is therefore presented on a proportionately consolidated basis.
The Groups primary measure of underlying profit before tax is Revenue profit.
This measure seeks to show the profit arising from ongoing operations and as such removes all items of a capital nature e. g. valuation movements and profit loss on disposal of investment properties and one-off or exceptional items.
Segment profit is the lowest level to which the profit arising from the ongoing operations of the Group is analysed between the two segments.
The Group manages its financing structure, with the exception of joint ventures, on a pooled basis and, as such, debt facilities and interest charges are not specific to a particular segment.

It will be paid on 26 July 2012 to shareholders who are on the Register of Members on 22 June 2012.
The final dividend is in addition to the third quarterly interim dividend of 7.2p or 56.1m paid on 26 April 2012 2011: 7.0p or 53.9m.
The total dividend paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2012 is 29.0p 2011: 28.2p.
The Company operates a scrip dividend scheme which provides shareholders with the opportunity to receive their dividend in shares as opposed to cash.
Shares issued in lieu of dividends during the year, all of which were non-PID distributions, totalled 66.6m 2011: 70.8m.
The difference between the gross dividend of 221.4m and the amount reported in the consolidated cash flow for the year of 153.1m is the shares issued in lieu of dividends 66.6m and the timing of the payment of the related withholding tax 1.7m.
A cash dividend may be paid as a PID, a non-PID, or a mixture of the two.
Following the enactment of the Finance No.
3 Act 2010, the issue of ordinary shares under the scrip in lieu of a cash dividend can also qualify as a PID, a non-PID, or a mixture of the two.
Confirmation of whether PID or non-PID treatment to a particular dividend will apply will be announced prior to the relevant ex-dividend date.
The scrip dividend alternative for the proposed final quarterly dividend will be a non-PID.

Income tax continued During the year the Group released provisions of 8.0m 2011: 16.8m to the income statement which were created in prior years and no longer required as the relevant uncertainties had been cleared.
At 31 March 2012, the Group held a provision of 21.3m 2011: 25.8m for interest on overdue tax in relation to a matter in dispute with HM Revenue and Customs, which may become payable if not settled in the Groups favour.
The provision will be released, and the tax paid to date of 60.7m recovered, if the Groups appeal is successful.
Land Securities Group PLC elected for group Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status with effect from 1 January 2007.
As a result the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.

The adjustment to net liabilities on joint ventures is the result of valuation deficits in previous years reversed by surpluses in the current year.
The profit on long-term development contracts has been removed from our adjusted earnings due to the long-term, capital nature of these programmes.
Our calculation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share has been changed in the year to exclude the profit on disposal of trading properties and profit on long-term development contracts.
In the future we expect these items to become larger but occur less frequently, in particular where they relate to the sale of residential units.
This would result in fluctuations to adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share if not excluded.
We have amended prior year numbers so that all years are presented on a consistent basis.

Accordingly, it excludes the effect of debt and other restructuring charges, non-recurring items and other items of a capital nature.
We believe our measure of adjusted diluted earnings per share is more appropriate than the EPRA measure in the context of our business.

The new MTN did not meet the IAS 39 requirement to be substantially different from the debt that it replaced.
Consequently the book value of the new debt is reduced to the book value of the original debt by the bond exchange fide-recognition adjustment which is then amortised to zero over the life of the new MTN.
The amortisation is charged to net interest expenses in the income statement.

Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Financial review p3437 and Our principal risks and how we manage them p4143.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specific financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest-rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these on the Groups financial performance and includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 28 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
As the Group came out of the last property downturn, its objective was to see rising asset values reduce gearing and LTV ratios.
During the year, gearing and LTV levels reduced in line with this objective.
The following table details a number of the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.
Financial risk management continued The following table summarises the Groups financial assets and liabilities into the categories required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments, Disclosure: 2012 2011 Group m m Available for sale financial assets 32.3 1.8 Loans and receivables 810.4 501.7 Financial liabilities at amortised cost 3,624.9 3,813.7 Net financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss 6.5 2.0 2,788.7 3,312.2 Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures, loans to third parties and commercial property backed loan notes.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specifically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, where the Group manages the deposit only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of Aare accepted.
Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of the Groups tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Property sales Property sales receivables relate to the sale of a small number of properties, for which all payments to date have been received when due.
The credit risk on outstanding amounts is considered to be low.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a significant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in government infrastructure projects.
Commercial property backed loan notes The Group acquired investments in commercial property backed loan notes which were independently rated with a rating of AAA at acquisition.
The majority of these notes were redeemed in the year ended 31 March 2012 and the remainder has been repaid subsequent to the balance sheet date.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of notes with final maturities between 2015 and 2036, and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Management monitors the Groups available funds as follows: March December September June March 2012 2011 2011 2011 2011 Group m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 29.7 61.1 19.0 14.2 37.6 Undrawn committed credit lines 1,085.0 930.0 1,790.0 1,945.0 1,772.0 Available funds 1,114.7 991.1 1,809.0 1,959.2 1,809.6 As a proportion of drawn debt 30.3% 26.1% 47.7% 54.0% 47.1% Land Securities Annual Report 2012 137 Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 continued 29.
Financial risk management continued The Groups core financing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Security Group The Groups principal financing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and Interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most flexible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0x.
As at 31 March 2012, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 37.6% 2011: 40.1%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational flexibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.
Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
2012 Less than Between Between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 193.2 313.5 862.3 4,623.8 Finance lease liabilities 2.1 3.6 3.5 203.5 Derivative financial instruments 6.5 Trade payables 7.4 Capital payables 48.1 250.8 317.1 872.3 4,827.3 2011 Less than Between Between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Group m m m m Borrowings excluding finance lease liabilities 212.9 190.1 1,102.0 4,789.9 Finance lease liabilities 2.2 2.1 5.9 243.2 Derivative financial instruments 2.0 Trade payables 12.2 Capital payables 74.6 301.9 192.2 1,109.9 5,033.1 iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates and availability of credit.
Interest rates The Group uses derivative products to manage its interest-rate exposure, and has a hedging policy that generally requires at least 80% of our existing debt plus increases in debt associated with net committed capital expenditure to be at fixed interest rates for the coming five years.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Specific interest-rate hedges are also used within our joint ventures to fix the interest rate exposure on limited-recourse debt.
Where specific hedges are used in geared joint ventures to fix the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these may qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2012, the Group including joint ventures had 0.6bn 2011: 0.7bn of interest rate swaps in place, and its net debt was 94.8% fixed 2011: 92.1%.
Based on the Groups debt balances at 31 March 2012, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the net interest payable in the income statement by 3.0m 2011: 4.3m.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.

Financial risk management continued Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign-currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where significant committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identified, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to fix the Sterling value.
Therefore the Groups foreign exchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign currency exposure at 31 March 2012 or at 31 March 2011.

Net pension deficit surplus Defined contribution scheme A defined contribution scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2012 2011 Group m m Defined contribution schemes 2.0 2.0 Defined benefit scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is a wholly-funded scheme, and the assets of the Scheme are held in a selfadministered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost is expected to increase as a percentage of salary of the Scheme members, under the projected unit credit method, as members approach retirement.
A full actuarial valuation of the Land Securities Scheme was undertaken on 30 June 2009 by the independent actuaries, Hymans Robertson Consultants & Actuaries.
As a result of this valuation, the Trustees and the Group have agreed that, in order to address the deficit at that time, employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary will be paid, together with additional employer contributions of 4m per annum, for a period of six years commencing on 1 July 2011.
This valuation was updated to 31 March 2012 using, where required, assumptions prescribed by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The next full actuarial valuation will be performed as at 30 June 2012.
All death-in-service and incapacity benefits arising during employment are wholly insured.
No post-retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.
The major assumptions used in the valuation, were in nominal terms : 2012 2011 Group % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.50 3.70 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.50 3.70 Discount rate 4.80 5.70 Ination Retail Price Index 3.50 3.70 Consumer Price Index 2.70 3.20 Expected return on scheme assets 5.25 6.02 140 Land Securities Annual Report 2012 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2012 continued 31.
Net pension deficit surplus continued The expected return on scheme assets is based on expectations for bonds and equities.
At the year end, the expected return on bonds is based on market yields of long-dated bonds at that date.
The estimated expected return on equities includes an additional equity-risk premium.
In the prior year, the Group changed the basis on which inflation is estimated from the Retail Price Index RPI to the Consumer Price Index CPI for part of the schemes liability.
This was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was therefore applied prospectively from 1 April 2010.
The effect of the change was to decrease the present value of the defined benefit obligation at 31 March 2011 by 2.1m.
The mortality assumptions used in this valuation were: 2012 2011 Group Years Years Life expectancy at age 60 for current pensioners Men 30.0 29.9 Women 31.7 31.5 Life expectancy at age 60 for future pensioners current age 40 Men 33.1 32.9 Women 34.9 34.7 The fair value of the assets in the scheme including annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment and the expected rate of return net of investment management expenses were: 2012 2011 2012 2011 Group % % m m Equities 7.50 7.50 59.6 64.0 Bonds and insurance contracts 3.98 4.93 101.8 86.3 Other 0.50 0.50 1.0 0.3 Fair value of scheme assets 162.4 150.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 164.8 141.9 Net pension deficit surplus 2.4 8.7 The major categories of scheme assets as a percentage of total scheme assets are as follows: 2012 2011 Group % % Equities 37 43 Bonds and insurance contracts 63 57 The scheme assets do not include any directly owned financial instruments issued by the Company.
Indirectly owned financial instruments had a fair value of less than 0.1m 2011: less than 0.1m.
2012 2011 Group m m Analysis of the amounts charged to the income statement Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 1.0 1.3 Charge to operating profit 1.0 1.3 Analysis of amount credited to interest expense Expected return on scheme assets 9.1 8.6 Interest on scheme liabilities 8.0 8.2 Net credit to interest expense 1.1 0.4 The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure the scheme liabilities are set out below: Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 2% or 3.3m Rate of mortality Increase by 1 year Increase by 2.5% or 2.0m As the above table demonstrates, changes in assumptions can have a significant impact on the scheme liabilities.
The assumptions agreed with the Trustees of the Scheme for the triennial valuation and subsequent interim updates differ from those described by IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
Using these assumptions would result in a balance sheet deficit for the Scheme of 35.0m at 31 March 2012 as opposed to a deficit of 2.4m.

Share-based payments The Groups share-based payments are all equity settled and comprise the Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave, various Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Deferred Bonus Share Scheme related to the annual bonus scheme, the Long-Term Incentive Plan including the Matching Performance Share Plan and Conditional shares granted on the appointment of Robert Noel on 1 January 2010.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the fair value of equity-settled sharebased payments to employees is determined at the date of grant and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares or options that will eventually vest.
The total cost recognised in the income statement is shown below: 2012 2011 Group m m Savings Related Share Option Scheme 0.3 0.1 Executive Share Option Schemes 0.5 0.6 Deferred Bonus Share Scheme 1.1 0.5 Long-Term Incentive Plan 2.7 2.1 Conditional shares granted 1 January 2010 0.2 0.5 4.8 3.8 Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the 2003 Savings Related Share Option Scheme all staff who have been with the Group for a continuous period of not less than six months are eligible to make regular monthly contributions into a Sharesave scheme operated by Lloyds TSB Bank and administered by Equiniti Ltd. On completion of the three, five or seven year contract period, ordinary shares in the Company may be purchased at a price based upon the current market price at date of invitation less a 20% discount.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the scheme before the options vest, or lapse if options are not exercised within six months of the bonus date.
In certain circumstances leavers may exercise their options early based upon current savings.
Alternatively, they may continue saving to receive the tax-free bonus for an additional six months or withdraw their cash immediately.
Fair-value calculations assume a lapse rate, based upon historic values, of approximately 20% for employees leaving the Group before vesting.

The underlying performance criteria are specific to each Executive Director and include Total returns, Group Profit, Investment and Business Unit performance.
Under the Additional Bonus Opportunity participants are eligible for additional awards of up to 200% of salary, 50% deferred into shares.
Awards under the plan are satisfied by transfers of existing shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
The shares are deferred for two or three years and normally forfeited if the Executive Director leaves employment during the period.
Fair value has been adjusted for participants who have left the Group, but no adjustment has been made for future anticipated lapses.
The deferred shares outstanding under the scheme are to be issued at nil consideration subject to vesting conditions being met.

In addition, an award of Matching Performance Shares can be made, linked to a co-investment in shares by participants.
The participants investment can be made through shares acquired under the Deferred Bonus Plan and or through optional pledging of shares purchased in the market.
The maximum level of matching is shares to the value of 50% of salary for Executive Directors and 25% of salary for senior executives.
On a two for one basis the maximum Matching Performance Shares award is over shares with a value of 100% of salary for Executive Directors and 50% of salary for senior executives.
Awards of LTIP Performance Shares and Matching Performance Shares are subject to the same performance measures over three years.
For awards up to and including those made on 31 March 2009 half of any award will vest based on achieving increases in Normalised Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share NADEPS.
The other half will vest dependent on the Groups Total Property Return TPR equalling, or exceeding, IPD weighted indices which reflect the sector mix of Land Securities investment portfolio.
For awards commencing with the grant of LTIP Performance Shares on 29 June 2009, NADEPS has been replaced by a relative Total Shareholder Return TSR measure.
Specifically, Land Securities three-year TSR performance share price increase plus reinvested dividends will be compared against the TSR performance of a comparator group of certain FTSE 350 Real Estate Companies.
Vesting is on a sliding scale between 0% for performance below the index and 100% for performance which beats the index by 4% per annum or more.
Awards may be satisfied by the issue of new shares and or transfer of treasury shares and or transfer of shares other than treasury shares.
For awards made with the TPR performance condition, fair value calculations assume that LTIP and matching shares will be awarded at 50% of the maximum possible under the scheme and have been adjusted for participants who have left the scheme, but no adjustment has been made for future anticipated lapses.
For the market based TSR awards, the effect of the performance conditions is incorporated into the grant date fair value of the award.
No subsequent adjustment to the charge can be made to reflect the outcome of the performance test.
Adjustments can, however, be made for participants who leave the scheme before vesting.
The shares outstanding under the scheme are to be issued at nil consideration provided performance conditions are met.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for shares exercised during the year was 722p 2011: 600p.

The expected life used in the model has been determined based upon managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Risk-free rate is the yield at the date of the grant of an option on a gilt-edged stock with a redemption date equal to the anticipated exercise of that option.
Fair-value inputs for awards with market performance conditions Fair values are calculated using the Monte-Carlo simulation option pricing model for awards with market performance conditions.
Awards made under the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan which were granted after 31 March 2009 include a Total Shareholder Return TSR condition, which is a market based condition.
