Regulatory Financial Review Kingston Wholesale Market : Asymmetric Broadband Origination in the Hull Area The asymmetric broadband origination market includes all broadband internet access products available to both consumers and businesses in the Hull regulatory area.
Business broadband products are now available for resale by other operators and this has assisted the acceleration of sales in the review period.
This proportion suggests further growth potential exists within the DSL market.
Internally generated revenue grew by 0.2m 5% and external revenue constituted 2% of the total in 2011 12 2010 11 Nil.
Maintenance costs increased 18% 0.3m over the period, principally in the exchange - exchange transmission.
Current cost capital employed declined 11% 0.1m, driven by a decline in the valuation of the exchange equipment.
Unit costs were broadly static in 2011 12 2%.

Like the 8 - 45Mb s market, this is a small market where individual unit number changes have a large relative impact.
Whilst ethernet is increasingly the preferred option for high bandwidth applications there remain some applications for which the traditional interface is advantageous.
Historical costs have increased by 3% but the main change in the operating costs 36% derives from the current cost adjustments, specifically the switch from holding gain to holding loss on the Local Loop 20k movement.
Overall circuit unit costs have increased 9% from 17,749 to 19,409.
