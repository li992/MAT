82 Synthomer plc Annual report 2012 Notes to the company financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as a financial liability.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the profit and loss account depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
The Company designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The Company only applies fair value hedge accounting for foreign currency exposure associated with the underlying hedged item.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is also recognised in the profit and loss account.
Net borrowings Net borrowings represents cash and cash equivalents together with short and long-term borrowings, as adjusted for the effect of related derivative instruments irrespective of whether they qualify for hedge accounting.

The UK dened benefit scheme is funded, with the assets of the scheme held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee-administered funds.

15 Pension commitments The Group participates in a funded scheme with both a dened benefit and dened contribution section the Yule Catto Group Retirement benefit Scheme.
The schemes dened benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a dened contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible Group employees.

The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
The pension charge for the year for the Company amounted to 19.4 million 2011 14.1 million.

The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme prepared for the purposes of making transitional disclosure in accordance with FRS 17 shows a net pension liability of 69.5 million at 31 December 2012 2011 73.9 million.
