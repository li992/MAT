The exercise period is usually 7 years from maturity and special rules apply to employees who leave the employment of the Group due to ill health, retirement or redundancy.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of shares under option at the date of grant.
No options have been issued under this scheme since 2004.
Options granted under the ESOS are subject to performance conditions and lapse if these are not achieved.
The performance hurdles require that for each annual grant 3-year growth targets set by the Board are achieved.
Growth was typically measured by growth in underlying earnings per share EPS as compared to RPI plus between 3% and 8% per annum over 3 years, adjusted to normalise pension and tax charges.
b 2008 Savings-related Share Option Scheme SAYE The Company operates a savings-related share option scheme which is open to all eligible UK employees.
Typically, all UK employees are eligible to participate including full and part-time employees.
Annual grants of options are made in September or October each year and become exercisable after 3 years.
Employees enter into a savings contract with the Yorkshire Building Society, who administer the scheme.
The options are granted at a 20% discount of the share price at the date of grant and lapse if not exercised within 6 months of maturity.
Special provisions apply to employees who leave their employment due to ill health, redundancy or retirement.
c 2005 Bonus Co-investment Plan BCIP The Plan offers Executive Directors and other senior executives selected by the Board the opportunity to invest part of their annual cash bonus for a financial year in the Companys shares, entitling them, provided certain performance targets are met, to a grant of additional matching shares.
In 2010 the ratio of matching shares was reduced for future grants from up to 2:1 to up to 1:1 of the gross deferred bonus.
The maximum amount of the annual cash bonus which may be eligible for matching was also reduced from 50% to 40%.
The net of tax amount is applied in the purchase of shares.
The first bonus award which qualified for investment in shares under the Plan was the award for the financial year ended December 2004 and the last qualifying bonus award will be for the financial year which commences 10 years after the adoption of the Plan.
John Menzies plc Annual Report 2012 92 Performance targets are based on real growth in earnings measured over three financial years.
For awards before 2010, if the percentage growth in the Companys EPS is RPI 8% or more, then the number of matching shares that will vest is 2.
For EPS growth of between RPI 3% pa and RPI 8% pa, the number of matching shares vesting will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
From 2010, if the percentage growth in the Companys EPS is RPI 6% or more, then the number of matching shares that will vest is 1.
For EPS growth of between RPI 3% pa and RPI 6% pa, the number of matching shares vesting will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
No matching shares will vest for EPS percentage growth of RPI 3% pa or less for any award.
Similar provisions apply in respect of dividends, transferability of rights and leavers.
d 2007 Divisional Performance Share Plan 2007 DPSP The DPSP was introduced to more closely align Divisional Directors and Senior Employees with the achievement of target divisional financial results DFR.
A detailed description of this plan is included in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 50.
Shares will vest at the end of 3 year financial periods.
A nil award will be achieved where the DFR is at or below the Threshold Performance Target and 100% will vest where the DFR is equal to or greater than the Stretch Performance Target, with a result between Threshold and Stretch being made on a straight-line basis.
Actual performance targets will be disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report in the year following the expiry of the performance period.
Fair values of share options Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
No performance conditions are included in the fair value calculations.
The fair value per option granted after November 2002 and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Executive Share Option Scheme Savings-Related Option Scheme Grant date May-04 Oct-12 Oct-11 Oct-10 Oct-09 Share price at grant date pence 418 622 498 450 346 Exercise price pence 418 497 395 355 279 Number of employees 2 1,086 838 736 51 Shares under option 101,776 489,080 406,216 362,060 36,270 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 25.0% 25.0% 25.0% 25.0% 25.0% Option life years 10 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 Expected life years 4 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 Risk-free rate 5.1% 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% 4.6% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Fair value per option pence 76 113 97 77 77 IFRS 2 charge per option 70 75 64 47 47 The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility over the last 3 years.
The expected life is the average expected period to vesting.
The risk free rate of return is the zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed award life.
Based on the daily 12-month trailing dividend yield averaged over the 12 months prior to valuation date.
The difference between the fair value and IFRS2 charge per option is due to adjustments for forfeiture risk.
