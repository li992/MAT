The options exercised during the year had a weighted average market value of 4.88 2011: 5.25.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes model for Savings Related Share Option Schemes and Executive Share Option Schemes and using the Monte Carlo option pricing model for Performance Share Plans.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in these calculations are as follows: 2012 2011 Savings Related Savings Share Related Share Executive Performance Options Performance Options Share Option Share Plan 3 Scheme 13 Share Plan 2 Scheme 12 Scheme 15 March 2012 April 2012 March 2011 April 2011 August 2011 Fair value at grant date 384p 68p 392p 91p 56p Share price 526p 520p 519p 503p 482p Exercise price nil 468p nil 453p 482p Expected volatility 21.0% 20.9% 26.2% 26.2% 24.3% Option life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.71% 3.71% 3.50% 3.62% 3.83% Risk-free rate 0.59% 0.59% 1.83% 1.93% 0.84% The expected volatility is based on historical volatility, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The historical volatility is calculated using a weekly rolling share price for the three year period immediately prior to the option grant date.
Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo models for the total shareholder return element of the Performance Share Plan in determining the fair value at grant date.
The assumptions used in this model were as follows: Performance Performance Share Plan 3 Share Plan 2 March 2012 March 2011 Average share price volatility FTSE 250 comparator group 46.3% 53.3% Average correlation FTSE 250 comparator group 16.7% 15.2%
