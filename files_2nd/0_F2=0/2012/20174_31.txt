66 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Directors of the Company review the financial performance of the Group on the investment basis.
However, the Directors also review information on a regular basis that is analysed by geography and is consistent with the consolidated accounting basis.
In accordance with IFRS 8, the segmental information provided below uses this geographic analysis of results as it is the most closely aligned with IFRS reporting requirements.
The Group only operates in one service line, being that of an investment holding company.
Therefore, no segmental analysis by service line has been produced.
The Group is an investment holding company and does not consider itself to have any customers.
The Group received 70% 2011: 70% of its portfolio income in the year from investments held in the UK and 30% 2011: 30% of portfolio income from investments held in Europe.
During the year, the Group received income from its investment in Oystercatcher of 29.8 million 2011: 26.4 million, AWG of 29.6 million 2011: 39.5 million and Eversholt of 33.0 million 2011: 6.5 million, which represents 28% 2011: 20%, 28% 2011: 30% and 31% 2011: 5% respectively of the investment return.
There was no other income entitlement during the year or in the comparative year that represented more than 10% of investment return.
Given the nature of the Groups operations, the Group is not considered to be exposed to any operational seasonality or cyclicality that would impact the financial results of the Group during the year or the financial position of the Group at 31 March 2012.

All debt investments were held at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group invested in Elgin Infrastructure Limited in December 2009.
It has been treated as a joint venture and under IAS 31 it has been held atfair value through profit and loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Elgin Infrastructure Limited was incorporated as a Special Purpose Entity in October 2009, to hold the underlying portfolio of PFI projects.

Further information regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments can be found in the section called Portfolio valuation methodology.
The debt investments held at fair value through profit and loss had a carrying value of nil 2011: 90.2 million.
In accordance with the fair value hierarchy the debt instruments held at fair value are classied as Level 2 with reference to observable market information.

Financials and otherinformation 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2012 71 8 Investment portfolio continued All unrealised movements on investments and foreign exchange movements are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income duringthe year.
The foreign exchange loss of 14.4 million 2011: 9.0 million in the Level 3 fair value reconciliation table on page 70 includes aforeign exchange loss of 14.4 million 2011: 8.7 million relating to assets that are held by intermediary holding companies of the Group, forwhich sterling is not the functional currency.
As a result, this exchange loss of 14.4 million 2011: 8.7 million is recognised within Other Comprehensive Income as part of the overall loss of 4.4 million 2011: 6.8 million arising on re-translation of foreign currency subsidiaries.
All other movements are recognised within the total Investment Return of 106.6 million 2011: 131.1 million.
The majority of the assets held within Level 3 are valued on a discounted cash ow basis, hence, the valuations above are sensitive to the discount rate assumed in the valuation of each asset.
Increasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would reduce the value of the portfolio by 72.5 million 2011: 50.5 million.
Decreasing the discount rate used in the valuation of each asset by 1% would increase the value of the portfolio by 82.5 million 2011: 57.7 million.

10 Financial risk management A full review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Returns and risk section.
Thisnote provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Returns and risk section where applicable, and providing further quantitative data on specic financial risks.
Each investment made by the Group is subject to a full risk assessment through a standardised investment approval process.
The Boards Investment Committee and the Investment Advisers investment process are part of the overall risk management framework.
The funding objective of the Group is that each category of investment ought to be broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders funds according to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets, and that funding needs ought to be met ahead of planned investment.
Capital structure The Group has a continuing commitment to capital efficiency.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash held on deposit, borrowings and shareholders equity.
The Companys Articles require its outstanding borrowings, including any financial guarantees to support subsequent obligations, to be limited to 50% of the gross assets of the Group.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed in Note 12 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to maximise the return to shareholders, while maintaining a strong capital base that ensures that the Group can operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.
The Board is responsible for regularly monitoring capital requirements to ensure that the Company is maintaining sufficient capital to meet its future investment needs.
The Company is regulated under the provisions of the Collective Investment Funds Jersey Law 1988 as a closed-ended collective investment fund and is not required as a result of such regulation to maintain a minimum level of capital.
Capital is allocated for investment in Utilities, Transportation and Social Infrastructure across the UK, continental Europe and Asia.
As set out in the Groups investment policy, the maximum exposure to any one investment is 20% of gross assets including cash holdings at the time of investment.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans and receivables, debt investments, cash, deposits, derivative contracts and receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk as a result of counterparty default equates to the current carrying value of these financial assets.
Through the year, the Groups cash and deposits were held with a variety of counterparties principally in AAA-rated money market funds, as well as in short-term bank deposits with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The counterparties selected for the derivative financial instruments were all banks with a minimum of a single A credit rating.
The credit quality of loans and receivables and debt instruments within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
The performance of underlying investments is monitored by the Board to assess future recoverability.
72 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Notes to the accounts continued 10 Financial risk management continued For those assets and income entitlements that are not past due, it is believed that the risk of default is small and capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the investment.
If the portfolio company has failed, or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a fair value adjustment for the full amount of the loan.
Fair value adjustments, or loan impairments, are made when the net present value of the future cash ows predicted to arise from the asset, discounted using the effective interest rate method, implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases a loan impairment is recorded equal to the valuation shortfall.
As at 31 March 2012, the Groups shareholder loan investment of 3.7 million in T2C was considered to be impaired 2011: 3.7 million impaired.
No other assets held by the Group were considered to be impaired.
The Company had no other loans or receivables or debt investments considered past due 2011: nil.
There was no movement in the value of this impairment during the year.
3i Infrastructure plc actively manages counterparty risk.
Counterparty limits are set and closely monitored by the Board and a regular review of counterparties is undertaken by the Investment Adviser and the Board.
As at 31 March 2012, the Group did not consider itself to have exposure to one large counterparty and held deposits and derivative contracts with a number of different counterparties to reduce counterparty risk.
Due to the size and nature of the investment portfolio there is concentration risk due to the size of the investments.
This risk is managed by diversifying the portfolio by sector and geography.
Liquidity risk Further information on how liquidity risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.

Cash ows upon settlement of interest rate swap contracts are intended to be settled net of the finance costs arising from loans and borrowings and therefore the net cash ows are shown in the table above.
The financial commitment relates to the Companys commitments to the 3i India Infrastructure Fund Note 17 and commitments in respect of nancing costs on undrawn credit facilities.
The cash ows from financial assets are not used to manage contractual liquidity risk.
Financials and otherinformation 3i Infrastructure plc Annual report and accounts 2012 73 10 Financial risk management continued Market risk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio, but the valuation of the portfolio and the carrying value of other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market uctuations.
The Groups sensitivities to these uctuations are set out below.
i Interest rate risk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
An increase or decrease of 250 basis points in interest rates over 12 months 2011: 250 basis points would lead to an approximate increase or decrease in net assets and to the net profit of the Group of 5.8 million 2011: 4.6 million.
This exposure relates principally to changes in interest payable and receivable on oating rate debt instruments and cash on deposit and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives and xed rate debt instruments held at year end.
In addition, the Group has indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate uctuations.
The Group does not hold any xed rate debt investments or borrowings and is therefore not exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
ii Currency risk Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The currency denominations of the Groups net assets are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis demonstrates the exposure of the Groups net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

There is an indirect exposure to the rupee through the investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund which is denominated in US dollars but it is only the direct exposure that is considered here.
iii Market price risk Further information about the management of price risk, which arises principally from unquoted equity and quoted debt investments, isprovided in the Risk section.
A 10% increase in the fair value of those investments would have the following direct impact on net profit andnet assets.

However, the Directors have a set investment policy that sets predened limits for the exposure of the Group to an individual asset.
These limits have not been exceeded at 31 March 2012 or at 31 March 2011, and hence the Directors do not consider that any of these investments represents a large exposure.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
Thefair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
As at 31 March 2012, the notional amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts held by the Group was 318.9 million 2011: 177.2million.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses variable to xed interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its oating-rate interest-bearing borrowings.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken through the statement of comprehensive income.

The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.
The valuations are market observable, internally calculated and veried to externally sourced data and are therefore included within Level 2.
