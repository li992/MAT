The reduction to 24% was subsequently enacted prior to 31 March 2012 under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 and the effect of this reduction is therefore reflected in the calculation of the groups UK deferred tax asset and liability.

Reclassifications of financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2009 the group reclassified certain financial instruments out of fair value through profit or loss.
These assets were originally classified as held-for-trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassified 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classifications, respectively.
The amount reclassified reflected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassification.
The group has not made any further reclassifications since 31 March 2009.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassified: Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value as at value as at value as at value as at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 000 2012 2012 2011 2011 Trading assets reclassified to loans and receivables 50 313 39 713 55 232 32 922 50 313 39 713 55 232 32 922 If the reclassifications had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2012 would have increased by 11.7 million 2011: a reduction of 12.4 million.
In the current year the reclassified assets have contributed 0.198 million loss through net interest and a loss of 1.4 million through impairments.
In the prior year, after reclassification, the assets contributed 0.167 million loss through net interest and a loss of 15.22 million through impairments.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that an entity disclose for each class of financial instruments measured at fair value the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety.
The fair value hierarchy reflects the significance of the inputs used in making fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.

Financial instruments for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity less than three months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate financial instruments The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing spreads earned on the transactions with spreads earned on similar new transactions entered into by the group.
The estimated fair value of fixed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash flows, using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted sub-debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash flow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments, that would normally be carried at fair value, continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques which cannot be relied on due to insufficient external inputs.

Derivative financial instruments The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash flows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.

Goodwill continued Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if evidence exists that goodwill might be impaired, by comparing the carrying value to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash flows within the cash-generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market conditions, adjusted for the specific risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash flow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to five years, adjusted for expected future events.
UK and Europe Excluding Evolution Group plc which was acquired during the year, the three most significant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Wealth & Investment, Investec Asset Management and Kensington.
For Investec Asset Management, the recoverability of goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested with reference to both the underlying profitability taking into account 2012 profits before taxation of 58.9 million 2011: 53.0 million and budgets and plans for the next three years and the value of the business as represented by funds under management of 36.2 billion 2011: 30.8 billion.
These factors support the carrying value of goodwill.
For Investec Wealth & Investment, goodwill of 197.1 million arising on the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc in June 2010 has been tested for impairment on the basis of cash flow projections for the next three years discounted at 11.5%.
Goodwill of 121.1 million arising on the acquisition of Kensington on 7 August 2008 was written down by 60.0 million at 31 March 2008 and has been written down by a further 21.5 million in the current year to 39.7 million.
The remaining goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of the existing book, assuming no new mortgage origination and no recovery in securitisation markets.
Cash flows have been projected for a five year period using the latest available information on debts and expected repayments discounted at 14.9%.
On this basis the value of goodwill is supported.
Future impairment of this goodwill will largely be dependent on the timing of future repayments, the level of future business generated and loan impairments.
In respect of the 36 million of goodwill arising on the acquisition of EVG, we have assessed the post acquisition performance of EVG and concluded that the goodwill is not impaired.
South Africa The majority of the goodwill attributed to the South African operations relates to Investec Asset Management, particularly to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identified as a separate cash-generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account profitability, being the current year profits and the budgeted profits and funds under management.
The discount rate applied of 12.8% is determined using the South African risk-free rate adjusted for the risk related to the cash-generating unit.
Movement in goodwill 2012 Goodwill arising from acquisitions relates to the following acquisitions in 2012 as detailed in the note 35 : Evolution Group plc 36.0 million Investec Capital Asia Limited 2.3 million.
2011 Goodwill arising from acquisitions included 198.5 million on the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc as detailed in note 35.
The reduction in goodwill relates to the sale and deconsolidation of investments previously consolidated as subsidiaries together with the sale of Rensburg Fund Management Limited.

Ordinary share capital continued Staff share scheme The group operates a share option and a share purchase scheme for employees.
The number of ordinary shares conditionally allocated to employees is disclosed in note 6.
Movements in the number of share options each option is in respect of one share issued to employees are as follows: At 31 March Number 2012 2011 Opening balance 88017939 67032559 Issued during the year 17797428 38141226 Exercised 12956577 13700863 Lapsed 4358067 3454983 Closing balance 88500723 88017939 The purpose of the staff share scheme is to promote an esprit fide corps within the organisation, create an awareness of Investecs performance and provide an incentive to maximise individual and group performance by allowing all staff to share in the risks and rewards of the group.
The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation based on their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff these share awards vest over periods varying from five to eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 262.

The guarantees are issued as part of the banking business.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS, the UK's statutory fund of last resort, provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members to meet its management expenses and compensation costs.
Individual participating members make payments based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent of total protected deposits as at 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year.
During the year ended 31 March 2011 the group also settled interim levies from the FSCS following the failure of Keydata Investment Services Limited Keydata and other intermediaries.
The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund the compensation costs associated with Bradford & Bingley, Heritable Bank, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, Landsbanki Icesave and London Scottish Bank plc.
These borrowings are on an interest-only basis until the FSCS determines otherwise.
The interest rate to be applied for the period 1 April 2012 on which levies for the scheme year 2012 2013 has recently been announced to increase from LIBOR plus 30 basis points to LIBOR plus 100 points.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 2.48 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS, including the interest on the loan from HM Treasury, in respect of the two levy years to 31 March 2012.
The accrual is based on estimates for the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
If the remaining available assets of the defaulting institutions are insufficient to allow the FSCS to repay the HM Treasury loan when due, the FSCS will agree a schedule of repayments of any remaining principal outstanding with HM Treasury, which will be recouped from the industry in the form of additional levies.
At present there remains a significant degree of uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies, which will depend upon the cost to the FSCS of compensating investors for the failure of other entities in the financial services sector.
The FSCS has raised the possibility that the failure of CF Arch Cru and MF Global may result in compensation being paid, but at present the FSCS has been unable to quantify the risk or extent of such further levies until more information regarding the losses and the likely number of eligible claimants becomes available.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amounts or timing of amounts that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a significant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.
These claims, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Specifically, a claim has been made in the Royal Court of Guernsey against Investec Trust Guernsey Limited, a subsidiary of Investec plc, for breach of equitable duty for skill and care with a related claim for liability for the debts of a client trust.
The outcome of these claims cannot reasonably be estimated at this time but Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of the proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the group.

Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with nontrading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the Central Treasury in the Specialist Bank.
Once aggregated and netted Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages, the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependent on the classification between fair value hedges and cash flow hedges and in particular accounting hedges require the identification of a direct relationship between a hedged item and a hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.

Hedges continued Cash flow hedges The group is exposed to variability in cash flows from changes in base interest rates.

Reclassifications Income statement reclassifications The previously reported principal transaction income line item has been split into the following line items: Investment income: income, other than margin, from securities held for the purpose of generating interest yield, dividends and capital appreciation Client flow trading income: income from trading activities arising from facilitating client activities.
Income from balance sheet management and other trading activities: includes proprietary trading income and other gains and losses as well as income earned from the balance sheet management desk.
With the continued reduction in insurance activity, it is deemed appropriate to move the associated line items to other operating income.

It is noted that there are no measurement changes nor are there any changes to total assets, liabilities, equity and the cash flow statement.
Each category of reclassification is noted below: Cash equivalent corporate paper Cash equivalent advances to customers has been renamed to non-sovereign and non-bank cash placements.
These balances represent short-term placements in corporates that run an in-house treasury function.
Loans and securitisation To better align the balance sheet with the Groups risk management disclosures, loans and advances and securitised assets that form part of our core lending activities has been separated from assets that are in warehoused facilities and structured credit investments arising out of our securitisation and principal finance activities.
This has resulted in a need to split loans and advances and securitised assets into two balance sheet categories for each.
Securitised liabilities has been split into two line items to enable the relationship with securitised assets to be clearly identified.
Investec integrated annual report 2012 | Annual financial statements 369 Notes to the annual financial statements continued 56.
Reclassifications continued Balance sheet reclassifications continued Securities reclassification The groups previous balance sheet split securities other than lending related into two key line items being trading and investment securities.
This classification was driven by the accounting rule sets that mainly distinguish between instruments fair valued through profit and loss, those carried at amortised cost held to maturity and those fair valued through equity available-for-sale.
The group is of the view that disclosure of the nature of exposures on the balance sheet, distinguishing between instruments held to manage balance sheet liquidity, as principal exposure and balance sheet instruments arising from trading desk activities provides more meaningful disclosure on the face of the balance sheet.
The line item Securities arising from trading activities includes all instruments other than derivative instruments that are held on balance sheet in relation to trading activities.
