23 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benets for the majority of employees and executive directors.
The main schemes in the UK, US and the Netherlands are of the dened benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post-retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benets is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2011 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2012 for the US and Netherlands schemes.
