68 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements 1 Segmental analysis IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Companys Board members as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly business review meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reects the segments underlying trading performance for the period under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group and the reporting of this measure at the monthly business review meetings, which are organised according to the product types, has been used to identify and determine the Groups operating segments.
Trading profit is dened as profit on operations before exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets, but includes the Group share of post-tax profit of associates and joint ventures.
The Groups operating segments at 31 March 2012 were Cheese, UK Spreads, MH Foods, St Hubert, Dairies previously Liquid Products and Customer Direct, Share of Associates and Joint Ventures and Other.
Certain of these operating segments have been aggregated and the Group reports on five continuing segments within the business: Cheese, Spreads, Dairies, Share of Associates and Joint Ventures and Other.
In previous years, the Liquid Products and Customer Direct segments were aggregated into one reportable segment being Dairies.
During the year ended 31 March 2012, these two businesses were merged with one senior management team now responsible for the whole of the Dairies segment.
Since the restructuring, discrete financial information for the former Liquid Products and Customer Direct divisions is no longer available or reviewed by either the Dairies senior management team or the CODM in the past, segment information was based on allocations of the combined cost base which is not now necessary.
The Dairies segment principally comprises the sale of non-branded fresh milk in the UK to a number of customers including major retail, foodservice and residential customers.
The segment is managed on a combined basis including milk sourcing, production volumes, demand planning, technical, quality and distribution.
The factories process and pack milk for a mix of customers which varies depending on customer and demand mix.
Having considered these factors, management has judged that this business now comprises one operating segment under IFRS 8.
For Group reporting purposes, the UK Spreads and St Hubert segments have been aggregated into one reportable segment being Spreads.
Both of these segments operate within Western Europe where long-term GDP growth rates and spreads market growth rates are similar.
Both manufacture predominantly branded dairy spreads, using similar production methods with a significant investment in advertising and promotion.
The two businesses have margins consistent with predominantly branded products.
The key input risks faced by both businesses are similar vegetable oil, packaging costs.
The majority of sales are to major multiple retailers and distribution methods are similar.
Having considered these factors, management has judged that the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria for these businesses have been met and that aggregation is appropriate.
The Spreads segment also incorporates the MH Foods business acquired in June 2011.
This business is branded, has similar end-customers as UK Spreads and shares the same input cost risks.
Therefore management judges that this too meets the IFRS 8 aggregation criteria.
Furthermore, its revenue, result and assets do not represent more than 10% of the Group so the quantitative criteria for a reportable segment are not met.
The Cheese segment has not been aggregated with any other segment.
This business manufactures predominantly branded cheese in the UK and sells mainly to retail customers.
Share of Associates and Joint Ventures forms a separate segment whose results are reviewed on a post-tax basis consistent with IFRS.
The Other segment comprises revenue earned from distributing product for third parties and certain central costs net of recharges to the operating segments.
Generally, all central costs less external other revenue are recharged to the operating segments such that their result reects the total cost base of the Group.
Other segment profit therefore is nil.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 69 1 Segmental analysis continued The segment results for the year ended 31 March 2012 and for the year ended 31 March 2011 and the reconciliation of segment measures to the respective statutory items included in the financial statements are as follows: Year ended 31 March 2012 2011 Note m m Segment external revenue Cheese 229.6 223.1 Spreads 328.7 285.5 Dairies 1,069.0 1,089.8 Other 4.8 6.1 Total segment external revenue 1,632.1 1,604.5 Segment profit Cheese 35.5 28.0 Spreads 63.0 53.3 Dairies 10.2 27.1 Share of associates net loss 14 0.3 0.2 Total segment profit 108.4 108.2 Finance costs 5 21.0 20.6 Adjusted profit before tax 87.4 87.6 Acquired intangible amortisation 12 9.1 8.7 Exceptional items 4 93.9 1.1 Other finance income pensions 5 5.5 Group loss profit before tax 10.1 77.8 Segment total assets Cheese 216.2 199.6 Spreads 498.0 507.3 Dairies 279.0 370.2 Share of associates 1.8 2.4 Other 39.5 34.1 Group 1,034.5 1,113.6 Unsegmented assets 96.3 68.9 Total assets 1,130.8 1,182.5 Inter-segment revenue Cheese 9.9 7.4 Spreads 4.7 8.4 Dairies Elimination 14.6 15.8 Total The numbers 70 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segmental analysis continued Year ended 31 March 2012 2011 Note m m Segment depreciation and amortisation excluding amortisation of acquired intangible assets Cheese 6.0 5.5 Spreads 6.2 6.2 Dairies 19.4 19.8 Other 2.5 3.0 Total 3 34.1 34.5 Segment additions to non-current assets Cheese 5.5 7.4 Spreads 28.8 8.3 Dairies 30.5 32.3 Other 3.1 4.1 Total 67.9 52.1 Segment exceptional items Cheese 1.9 Spreads 2.6 Dairies 91.3 3.0 Share of associates Total 4 93.9 1.1 Interest income and expense are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Group treasury is centrally managed and external interest income and expense is mostly incurred in the UK and is not allocated to segments.
Where interest is reviewed by the CODM it is done so on a net basis.
Further analysis of the Group interest expense is provided in Note 5.
Tax costs are not included in the measure of segment profit reviewed by the CODM.
Tax is centrally managed and the group effective tax rate, not individual segment tax rates, is reported.
Segment assets comprise property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets, inventories, receivables, assets in disposal group held for sale and investments in associates and joint ventures using the equity method and deferred consideration but exclude cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets and deferred tax assets as these items are managed on a Group basis.
Other segment assets comprise certain property, plant and equipment that is not reported in the segments.
Total segment liabilities have not been presented as this measure is not regularly reviewed by or provided to the CODM.
Inter-segment revenue comprises the sale of nished Cheese and Spreads products to the Dairies segment on a cost plus basis and is included in the segment result.
Other inter-segment transactions principally comprise sales of cream from the Dairies segment to the Spreads segment for the manufacture of butters.
Cream sold into Spreads is priced by reference to external commodity markets and is adjusted regularly so as to reect the costs that the Spreads segment would incur if it were a stand alone entity.
Revenue from inter-segment cream sales is not reported as revenue to the CODM but as a reduction to the Dairies segments input costs.
Segment depreciation and amortisation excludes amortisation of acquired intangible assets of 9.1 million 2011: 8.7 million as these costs are not charged in the segment result.
Segment additions to non-current assets comprise additions to goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment through capital expenditure and acquisition of businesses.

The Group has one customer which represents more than 10% of total group revenues in the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: none.
This customer represents 175.7 million of revenue 10.8% across the Cheese, Spreads and Dairies segments.
The business segmentation above is based upon similar product groupings, namely cheese, spreads and dairies, and therefore the analysis of Group revenue by product and services is consistent with the revenue analysis presented above with the exception of non-milk product sales in the Dairies segment, which amounted to 100.1 million 2011: 112.3 million.

Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2012 2011 m m Depot administration restructuring costs Dairies 5.3 3.0 Impairment of goodwill, property, plant and equipment Dairies 81.7 Provision for bad debts Dairies 4.3 Restructuring costs Spreads 2.6 93.9 3.0 profit on disposal of controlling interest in Wexford Creamery Limited 1.9 93.9 1.1 Tax relief on exceptional items 13.1 1.7 80.8 0.6 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 73 4 Exceptional items continued Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2012 comprise: 5.3 million of costs associated with the rationalisation of administrative activities and other structural changes in the Dairies depot network.
This restructuring results in centralisation of back ofce activities supporting the depot network.
The majority of costs relate to redundancies 2.2 million and other incremental operating costs associated with delivery of the project 3.1 million.
The project will complete in 2012 13 with up to a further 7 million of expenditure anticipated.
Trading in the Dairies segment has been adversely impacted in 2011 12 by increased costs of milk, the ongoing level of competition in the sector and in the second half by significant falls in the value of cream.
Furthermore, volume declines in doorstep deliveries continue despite the growth of our milk&more business.
A range of actions is underway in order to restore margins within Dairies to an acceptable level in the medium term and create a cost-efficient, sustainable dairies business.
These include the expected closure of sites referred to below subject to consultation.
However, the outlook for Dairies is weaker and more uncertain than it was in 2011.
This, combined with the volatility of assumptions in forecasting future cash ows due to the commoditised nature of the business and the competitive environment, has led management to conclude that the total carrying amount of Dairies goodwill of 70.7 million should be impaired as it cannot be supported on a value in use basis.
This impairment reduces the carrying value of goodwill in this segment to nil.
Further details are provided in Note 11.
Furthermore, the Group has announced a major restructuring of its Dairies operations with the expected closure of two processing sites at Aintree in Liverpool and Fenstanton in Cambridgeshire subject to consultation.
These closures are expected to be completed in 2012 13.
As a result of the anticipated closures, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment at these sites can no longer be supported by a value in use calculation based upon future cash ows generated by these assets.
Consequently, the carrying value of property, plant and equipment has been impaired by 9.8 million at 31 March 2012.
Further details are provided in Note 10.
In addition, an impairment of 0.4 million has been recorded against intangible assets see Note 12 and 0.8 million of inventories of engineering spares and packaging have been written off see Note 15.
At 31 March 2012, following the impairments of goodwill, property, plant and equipment and intangibles, there remains property, plant and equipment and intangibles with a carrying value of 161.6 million in the Dairies segment.
On 13 February 2012, the Group announced that a customer, Quadra Foods Limited Quadra had gone into administration.
As a result a bad debt provision of 4.3 million has been charged representing the entire amount owing from this customer.
Bad debt write-offs of this size are extremely rare and management considers this a one-off incident which, due to its material size, has been classied as exceptional.
The Group previously purchased fresh milk from Farmright Limited Farmright, a member of the same group as Quadra, which has also gone into administration.
In the opinion of management, set-off arrangements were agreed and in place between Dairy Crest Limited and Quadra Farmright at the date of their going into administration, however this is being challenged in the administration process.
Under IFRS the recognition criterion threshold for a contingent asset is higher than that required for a contingent liability and therefore, although a provision has been recorded against amounts due from Quadra, no exceptional gain has been recognized in the year ended 31 March 2012 in relation to amounts owed to Farmright as the outcome is not yet virtually certain.
On 17 May 2011, the Group announced that, subject to a consultation process, production of its leading dairy spread brand, Clover, would be consolidated into its site in Kirkby, Liverpool.
The Clover manufacturing process is currently split between Kirkby, Liverpool and Crudgington, Shropshire.
This consolidation will result in approximately 90 redundancies at Crudgington and the creation of approximately 45 jobs at Kirkby.
The consolidation will not be completed until 2012 13, however exceptional costs of 2.6 million have been incurred in the year ending 31 March 2012.
These predominantly comprise redundancy costs 1.2 million and the impairment of property, plant and equipment impacted by the restructured operations 1.0 million.
This impairment reduces the carrying value of equipment made redundant by this processing change to managements best estimate of its fair value less costs to sell see Note 10.
In addition, inventories of engineering spares of 0.2 million have been written off see Note 15 and other project costs of 0.2 million have been incurred.
A further 2.5 million is expected to be incurred in the first half of 2012 13 in relation to this consolidation comprising further redundancies and duplicate running costs during the transfer of physical production.
Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2011 comprised: 3.0 million of costs associated with the rationalisation of administration activities in the Dairies depot network.
Most of the cost related to redundancies 2.5 million, but certain incremental running costs were incurred 0.5 million.
On 12 June 2010 the Group sold 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited WCL for cash proceeds of 9 million, resulting in a 30% shareholding post-disposal and a loss of controlling interest to Wexford Milk Producers WMP.
At 31 March 2010, the assets and liabilities of WCL were disclosed as a disposal group held for sale and the carrying value of assets was impaired to reect the estimated fair value less costs to sell.
The final gain on disposal of 1.9 million in 2010 11 included the reclassication to profit and loss of certain items previously taken to other comprehensive income and is further analysed in Note 29.

Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 75 6 Tax expense continued A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2012 Budget Statement.
This included a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 26% to 24%.
This reduction was dealt with by resolution under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act at the end of the Budget debate and as such was substantively enacted for IFRS purposes on 26 March 2012.
We have adjusted deferred tax balances at 31 March 2012 to reect the 24% rate.
Note that substantial deferred tax liabilities in respect of St Hubert brands are calculated at the prevailing corporation tax rate in France and are therefore unaffected by these changes.
Further reductions to the main rate of UK corporation tax are proposed that will reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 22% by April 2014.
These are expected to be separately enacted each year.
We estimate that a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 22% would reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 1.8 million.

Basic EPS is calculated on the basis of Group profit for the year less profit attributable to non-controlling interests divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Note that in the circumstances where there is a basic loss per share, share options are anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation of diluted losses per share.
The shares held by the Dairy Crest Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP are excluded from the weighted average number of shares in issue used in the calculation of earnings and diluted earnings per share.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 77 8 Earnings per share continued To show earnings per share on a consistent basis, which in the Directors opinion reects the ongoing performance of the business more appropriately, adjusted earnings per share has been calculated.

The carrying value of property, plant and equipment at these sites and certain plant and equipment at our site in Foston, Derbyshire could no longer be supported by value in use and an impairment has been recorded to reduce the carrying value to managements best estimate of fair value less costs to sell.
Land and buildings at Aintree and Fenstanton have been impaired by 2.1 million resulting in a carrying value of 4.5 million reecting the best estimate of resale value of these sites, both of which are owned.
Plant and equipment at Aintree, Fenstanton and Foston have been impaired by 7.7 million resulting in a carrying value of 0.2 million reecting the best estimate of resale value less costs of sale or disposal.
All of these impairments have been recorded as exceptional items in the Dairies segment see Note 4.
At 31 March 2012, there remains property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of 142.1 million in the Dairies segment after these impairments.
Following the decision in 2011 to transfer all Clover manufacture from Crudgington, Shropshire to Kirkby, Liverpool certain assets at Kirkby became obsolete as future plans for the utilisation of these assets had changed.
Obsolete assets with a carrying value of 1.0 million were identied and these assets were impaired to nil value reecting managements best view as to their fair value less costs of removal and sale.
This impairment has been recorded as an exceptional item in the Spreads segment see Note 4.

Prior to 2011 12, goodwill allocated to Dairies was separately allocated to Liquid Products and Customer Direct.
Although the same Dairies sites process fresh milk for both businesses, the CODM used to review the results of each division separately based on an allocation of assets and costs.
Because the CODM reviewed discrete results of the two divisions, they were separate operating segments under IFRS 8 and, as such, could not be tested for goodwill impairment at a higher level than this.
During the year, Liquid Products and Customer Direct have been integrated into one segment reporting on a combined basis consistent with the underlying asset and cost base.
As a result, goodwill impairment testing is now performed on the Dairies segment, it being the smallest identiable group of assets that generates cash inows that are largely independent of cash inows from other groups of assets.
All CGUs are tested for impairment annually by comparing the carrying amount of that CGU with its recoverable amount.
Recoverable amount is determined based on a value-in-use calculation using cash ow projections based on financial budgets and strategic plans approved by senior management covering a three-year period and appropriate growth rates beyond that.
The discount rate applied to the projections is 8.4% for UK Spreads, MH Foods and Cheese 2011: 8.3%, 9.7% for St Hubert 2011: 9.1% and 9.4% for Dairies 2011: 8.3% for Liquid Products and 8.7% for Customer Direct.
Discount rates are pre-tax and calculated by reference to average industry gearing levels, the cost of debt and the cost of equity based on the capital asset pricing model and CGU-specic risk factors.
Discount rates have remained broadly in line with March 2011.
The Dairies discount rate carries a higher risk due to the more commoditised nature of the business model.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the three-year period for UK Spreads, St Hubert, MH Foods and Cheese is 2.0% per annum being the estimated UK and Euro zone long-term growth rate adjusted for industry growth rates and extrapolation risks 2011: 2.0% per annum beyond year three.
The growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond a five-year period for the Dairies CGU is 0.0% with cash ows in the first five years being based on extended strategic plans for that business 2011: Liquid Products and Customer Direct growth rates of 2.0% and 0.0% respectively beyond year three.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to groups of CGUs at 31 March 2012 is: Dairies Nil 2011: Liquid Products 30.9 million, Customer Direct 39.8 million MH Foods 6.7 million 2011: nil UK Spreads 65.5 million 2011: 65.5 million St Hubert 185.7 million 2011: 197.2 million Cheese 2.1 million 2011: 2.1 million The key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations: Gross margin budgeted gross margins are based initially on actual margins achieved in the preceding year further adjusted for projected input and output price changes, volume changes, new initiatives and anticipated efficiency improvements.
The budgeted margins form the basis for strategic plans, which incorporate longer-term market trends.
Discount rates reect managements estimate of the risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital WACC for each CGU.
Raw materials prices budgets are prepared using the most up to date price and forecast price data available.
This is based on forward prices in the market place adjusted for any contracted prices at the time of forecast.
The key resources are milk, vegetable oils, fuel oil, diesel, gas and electricity and packaging costs.
Growth rate estimates for periods beyond the length of the strategic plans, growth estimates are based upon published industry research adjusted downwards to reect the risk of extrapolating growth beyond a three year time frame.
For the residential business, long-term rates of market decline as seen over recent years have been extrapolated forward offset by growth assumptions for milk&more.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 81 11 Goodwill continued The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each CGU where appropriate and to be realistically achievable in the light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
2011 12 Dairies CGU impairment of goodwill Dairies margins have been impacted in 2011 12 by a number of factors including higher input costs, falling realisations for cream a by-product of milk production, the ongoing decline of residential sales and high levels of competition in the sector.
Furthermore, weak UK consumer demand and a very competitive landscape have adversely impacted the Groups expectations regarding the speed of recovery in future Dairies margins.
In 2011 we highlighted that changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the then Liquid Products and Customer Direct CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
As described in Note 4, management has taken action to close certain sites in order to underpin factory utilisation and improve operating efficiencies.
This combined with other activities will, in the opinion of management, restore margins to an acceptable level in the medium term.
However, the outlook is signicantly weaker than it was in 2011 and margin recovery will take longer than previously anticipated.
Given the inherent uncertainties of cash ow forecasts in what is a predominantly commodity business in a competitive sector especially given the sensitivity of low absolute margins, management has concluded that it is appropriate to fully impair the carrying amount of Dairies goodwill as there is no assurance that it can be supported on a value in use basis, excluding the impact of restructuring activities.
Therefore, management has concluded that it is appropriate at this stage to fully impair the carrying value of Dairies goodwill resulting in an exceptional charge of 70.7 million recorded in the year ended 31 March 2012.
After fully impairing goodwill and impairing certain other property, plant, equipment and intangible assets, the remaining carrying value of these items at 31 March 2012 is 161.6 million.
As goodwill has been fully impaired, there is no headroom and any future adverse change in key assumptions would lead to further impairment against these assets.
There are changes in key assumptions in the calculation of Dairies CGU value in use that could result in further impairments.
The key assumptions are discount rates and annual cash ows.
A 1% increase in the discount rate applied, with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a further impairment of approximately 20 million.
A reduction in cash ows of 2 million per annum in perpetuity, representing approximately 2% margin, with all other assumptions unchanged, would result in a further impairment of 22 million.
Other CGUs sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the UK Spreads, St Hubert, MH Foods and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
2010 11 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the UK Spreads, St Hubert and Cheese CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For the Customer Direct CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumption is future growth rates.
Management has assumed no growth after year three in the value in use calculation.
Should any decline in the Customer Direct CGU continue and be greater than 10% per annum beyond year three then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to a value approximately equal to its carrying amount.
For the Liquid Products CGU, there are possible changes in key assumptions which could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount although management believes that the assumptions used in performing the impairment test for this business are cautious.
The key assumptions are future margins and discount rate.
Management has assumed growth in margins over the next three years following a decline in the year ended 31 March 2011.
Should margins reduce by 20% each year versus assumptions used for impairment testing, then the value in use for this CGU could be reduced to below its carrying amount.
Management has assumed a discount rate of 8.3% in calculating value in use.
Should the discount rate increase to 10% then the carrying value would exceed the CGUs recoverable amount.

The WCL options comprise call and put options over 20% of the company for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of WCLs post-tax profits from June 2010 until the date of exercise.
This comprises a Level 3 valuation, namely that it is not based on inputs observable directly or indirectly.
Management has valued this option by comparing the current equity accounted carrying value of the 20% holding with the estimated present value of consideration received from the exercise of the option.
The difference between these amounts comprises the option value of 1.6 million at 31 March 2012.
The principal input assumptions in valuing these options are i estimated future profits of WCL which have been based upon best available budgets and forecasts ii an appropriate post-tax discount rate of 6% and iii an option exercise date of 2018.
Over the period until exercise of these options, any movement in the fair value of these instruments is charged credited to the income statement.

The existing 100 million and 85 million plus 175 million revolving credit facilities maturing in November 2011 and July 2013 respectively were cancelled and repaid on 19 October 2011 using funds drawn under the new facility.
Upfront debt issuance costs amounted to 3.0 million and these are charged to the consolidated income statement over four years being the expected life of the new facility before it is replaced.
Unamortised debt issuance costs at 31 March 2012 amounted to 2.7 million 2011: nil of which 0.7 million will amortise within 12 months.
The Group raised $85 million 54.5 million by way of a debt private placement with US investors on 30 November 2011.
These notes were a mix of seven-year $25 million and ten-year $60 million maturities.
All principal and interest cash ows have been swapped into Sterling at an exchange rate of 1.56 and interest rates of 3.87% and 4.52% on the seven and ten year notes respectively.
The Group is subject to a number of covenants in relation to its borrowing facilities which, if contravened, would result in its loans becoming immediately repayable.
These covenants specify a maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times, and minimum interest cover ratio of 3.0 times.
No covenants were contravened in the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: None.
Key covenants under the new revolving credit facility and the new debt private placement were unchanged from existing covenants.

This valuation resulted in a deficit of 137 million compared to the IAS19 deficit of 142.4 million reported at that date.
Future cash funding has been agreed to continue at 20 million per annum.
The following tables summarise the components of net benefit expense recognized in the consolidated income statement and the funded status and amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet for the dened benefit plans.

The level of cash contributions will continue at this level until March 2018 based on the latest schedule of contributions which was signed in June 2011.
This amount will include 2.8 million per annum of rental payments for land and buildings that are subject to a sale and leaseback agreement between the Group and the Scheme as part of the final schedule of contributions.
The land and buildings included in these arrangements are subject to long term leases and the Group will continue to benefit from substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
On this basis, under IFRS, these land and buildings continue to be recognized in property, plant and equipment and rental payments of 2.8 million per annum are treated as cash contributions, reecting the substance of the arrangements.
In December 2008, certain obligations relating to retired members were hedged by the purchase of an insurance contract.
A further insurance contract for retired members was purchased in June 2009 resulting in coverage for all members who retired up to August 2008.
These contracts are included within scheme assets and their value will always be equal to the obligation as calculated under IAS 19 for those members covered.
This will reduce the volatility of the reported dened benefit obligations in future periods.
The purchase of the second insurance contract in June 2009 was funded by the sale of equities.
Subsequently, in order to re-establish an appropriate equity weighting of scheme assets, the Fund purchased equity total return swaps synthetic equity.
These instruments comprise an asset leg and a liability leg.
The asset leg generates a return based on UK and overseas equity indices and the liability leg incurs a cost Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 89 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued based on LIBOR plus margin.
Credit risk is minimised since collateral is provided by the counterparties to the benefit of the Fund when the instruments are in the money.
At 31 March 2012, the valuation above comprises a positive equity exposure of 226.4 million and a negative LIBOR exposure of 164.6 million 2011: equity exposure of 290.7 million and LIBOR exposure of 200.2 million.
An Enhanced Transfer Value ETV exercise took place during the year ended 31 March 2012 which resulted in approximately 220 members transferring a total of 14.3 million in ETVs out of the Fund.
The net gain as a result of this settlement of 0.3 million represents the difference between the 14.3 million transferred out and the corresponding liabilities, measured on an IAS 19 basis, at the date that the settlement became binding.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates with the exception of the insured retirement obligations which equal the IAS 19 valuation of obligations which they cover.
The expected rate of return on equities of 8.0% March 2011: 8.0% reects historic UK equity returns with an assumption for 2012 that the equity market rally in 2011 12 will continue in the medium term.
The equity return assumption represents a reasonable risk premium over gilts.
It is within the range of assumptions typically used by companies of a similar size.
This return assumption is also applied to the equity leg on equity total return swaps.
The liability leg cost assumption is based upon medium term LIBOR yields.
The expected rate of return on bonds of 4.3% March 2011: 5.2% is based upon the gross redemption yields available on a similar prole of gilts and corporate bonds.
The average duration of scheme liabilities is approximately 19 years 2011: 19 years.
Discount rate assumptions for each reporting period are based upon quoted AA-rated corporate bond indices, excluding collateralised bonds, with maturities matching the schemes expected benefit payments.
In 2010 the Government announced that in future salary increases to deferred pensions in excess of guaranteed minimum pensions GMPs and to GMPs accrued after 6 April 1988 will be linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI instead of the Retail Prices Index RPI.
In the second half of the year ended 31 March 2011, having reviewed the Scheme rules and previous communications with members, the Trustee and Company concluded that no constructive obligations had been created counter to the Scheme rules and that therefore those rules would apply.
Under the Scheme rules RPI continues to be applied for pensions in payment but statutory increases are applied for the majority of deferred members being CPI.
The result of this change, which was communicated to members, was to reduce future pension ination assumptions for deferred members when determining Scheme liabilities.
The impact was to reduce Scheme liabilities by approximately 43 million in 2010 11.
The RPI ination assumptions are determined by adopting a yield curve approach, based on the break-even rate of ination implied by xed interest gilt yields and index-linked yields.
Applying this approach to the Schemes projected benefit payments gives an average break-even ination assumption of 3.4%.
The CPI ination assumption is determined by reference to adjusted RPI rather than by reference to CPI-linked investments where the market is small and illiquid.
The principal differences between RPI and CPI are i the formula effect due to RPI using arithmetic means and CPI geometric means, and ii the bundles of goods considered CPI excludes mortgage payments and other housing costs.
The assumption used at 31 March 2012 is that CPI ination will track 1.0% points below RPI ination in the long term 0.8% formula effect and 0.2% component effect and is therefore set at 2.4%.
Pension increase assumptions are based on RPI with an adjustment to reect caps within the Scheme rules.
Mortality assumptions were updated in the year ended 31 March 2011 based on analysis of the membership data performed as part of the March 2010 full actuarial valuation.
The result was an increase in life expectancy assumptions of approximately 1.7 years.
The same mortality input assumptions have been used for March 2012 with no material resultant change in life expectancies.
The scheme deficit is highly dependent upon input assumptions which are set at the reporting period end dates.
A 0.1% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 17 million 2011: 14 million.
A 0.1% increase in the ination assumption would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 16 million 2011: 11 million.
An increase in life expectancy across all members of one year would increase the scheme obligation by approximately 43 million 2011: 40 million.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognized on transition to IFRS, and taken directly to equity of 93.2 million, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognized in the Group statement of other recognized income and expense before 1 April 2004.
The Company recognises no liabilities on its balance sheet, or charges or credits in its income statement or statement of recognized income and expense in relation to the Group pension plans.

26 Share based payment plans Group The Group has three share option schemes in operation.
The Dairy Crest Long Term Incentive Share Plan LTISP This is a long-term incentive scheme under which awards are made to directors and senior managers consisting of the right to acquire shares for a nominal price subject to the achievement of financial targets based on i total shareholder return TSR over a three year period versus comparator companies and ii growth in adjusted basic earnings per share.
From 2009, the TSR element was increased from 50% to 60% of the awards granted.
The vesting period for grants made under this scheme is 3 years with an exercise period of 7 years.
On 1 July 2011 995,183 options were granted under the LTISP scheme June 2010: 861,651.
There are no cash settlement alternatives.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 93 26 Share based payment plans continued Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme All employees are eligible to join the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme, which allows employees to use regular monthly savings to purchase shares.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market value of the shares.
No financial performance criteria are attached to these options and they vest three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of six months.
On 16 December 2011 1,445,978 options were granted under the Dairy Crest Sharesave Scheme at a grant price of 265 pence.
No options were granted in the year ended 31 March 2011.
Deferred bonus scheme From 2005 06, bonuses earned that are in excess of 50% of basic salary are deferred in shares and from 2011 in share options with a vesting period of three years.
The only vesting condition is continuing employment.
The cost of these shares is charged over four years being the year the bonus was earned and the three-year vesting period and is based on the number of shares issued or from 2011 over which nil cost options are granted and the share price at the date of issue.
Deferred shares to the value of nil are to be issued in relation to the year ended 31 March 2012 2011: 43,810.
The number of share options and weighted average exercise price for each of the schemes is set out as follows: LTISP Sharesave scheme Weighted average exercise price Number Number pence Options outstanding at 1 April 2011 1,957,774 3,855,782 237.8 Options granted during the year 995,183 1,445,978 265.0 Reinvested dividends 158,226 Options exercised during the year 3,252 45,195 227.0 Options forfeited during the year 1,247,523 488,155 313.4 Options outstanding at 31 March 2012 1,860,408 4,768,410 238.4 Exercisable at 31 March 2012 25,563 Options outstanding at 1 April 2010 2,071,382 4,481,625 239.1 Options granted during the year 861,651 Reinvested dividends 138,480 Options exercised during the year 41,076 41,836 227.0 Options forfeited during the year 1,072,663 584,007 248.0 Options outstanding at 31 March 2011 1,957,774 3,855,782 237.8 Exercisable at 31 March 2011 26,976 The weighted average exercise price for LTISP options is nil.
Sharesave scheme options are exercisable up to September 2015 at prices ranging from 227p to 265p March 2011: exercisable up to March 2013 at prices ranging from 227p to 487p.
LTISP options are exercisable at varying dates up to July 2021 March 2011: June 2020.
The remaining weighted average contractual life of options outstanding at 31 March 2012 is 8.71 years for the LTISP and 1.67 years for the Sharesave Scheme 2011: 8.64 years and 1.86 years respectively.
The weighted average share price on exercise of LTISP options was 3.49 2011: 3.73 and 3.47 on exercise of Sharesave options 2011: 3.76.
The fair value factor of the Sharesave Scheme options issued in December 2011 is 22% giving a fair value of 0.58 per option granted.
This has been computed using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The key assumptions used in the valuation model for the December 2011 grant were: Expected share price volatility 38%, risk free rate of interest 0.5% and dividend yield 6.2%.
The volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Dairy Crest Group plc share price over a period commensurate with the expected option life, ending on the grant date of the option.
There were no Sharesave Scheme options granted during the year ended 31 March 2011.
The numbers 94 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Share based payment plans continued The LTISP has market and non-market based performance conditions.
The fair value of the market performance element of the LTISP awards is calculated using a Monte Carlo option pricing model.
The fair value factor for the award made in July 2011 is 65% for the TSR element and 100% for the EPS element June 2010: 73% TSR and 100% EPS giving a fair value of 2.91 per option granted 2010: 3.34.
The share price on granting 2011 awards was 3.68 2010: 3.99.
The non-market performance element of the LTISP is based on EPS and the charge for this is the value of shares expected to vest calculated by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
Volatility assumptions are made for Dairy Crest Group plc and comparator companies based on historical volatility of share prices over a period commensurate with the option life.
The input assumptions for the LTISP grant in the year ended 31 March 2012 were as follows: Term 3 years 2011: 3 years Volatility 40% 2011: 46% Risk free rate 1.3% 2011: 1.3% Average volatility of comparator TSR 44% 2011: 52% TSR correlation Dairy Crest vs comparators 22% 2011: 27% The expected life of the LTISP options is assumed to be equal to the vesting period, being three years.
The Group expense arising from share option plans for the year ended 31 March 2012 is 2.4 million 2011: 1.3 million See Note 9.

29 Business combinations and disposals Year ended 31 March 2012 Acquisition On 30 June 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Morehands Limited trading as MH Foods, a manufacturer of branded low calorie spray oils and salad dressings.
Initial cash consideration was 11.9 million, with further consideration of 1.6 million paid in October 2011.
The final fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of the business at the date of acquisition was: Fair value Book to Group value m m Property, plant and equipment 0.5 0.5 Intangible asset Frylight brand 6.0 Inventories 0.6 0.6 Receivables 1.5 1.5 Cash 1.2 1.2 Payables 0.9 0.9 Current tax 0.5 0.5 Deferred tax 1.6 0.1 Net assets 6.8 2.3 Goodwill 6.7 13.5 Comprising: Cash consideration 13.5 The Frylight brand is estimated to have a useful economic life of 15 years and the amount capitalised as an intangible asset and related deferred tax will be amortised over this period.
This life is consistent with the 15-25 year useful economic lives assumed on the acquisition of St Hubert.
Goodwill, representing the cost of acquisition less net identiable assets and liabilities assumed on acquisition, arises on consolidation only and there is no amortisation or related tax deduction in the accounts of Dairy Crest Limited, the acquiring entity.
Group reported revenue and result would not be materially different had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2011.
Revenue and profit from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2012 were 5.8 million and 1.3 million respectively.
The Group incurred fees of 0.3 million in relation to this acquisition which have been charged to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year ended 31 March 2012.
Goodwill of 6.7 million comprises certain intangible benets of the acquisition that could not be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These include the synergistic benets resulting from access to the wider groups sales channels, marketing expertise and product development pipeline.
Year ended 31 March 2011 Disposals On 12 June 2010 the Group sold 50% of the shares in Wexford Creamery Limited WCL for cash proceeds of 9 million.
This disposal was effected by way of a share repurchase by WCL.
At the same time, the Group entered into two option agreements over its remaining 30% ownership.
The first option agreement granted a five year call option to the majority shareholder, being Wexford Milk Producers WMP, over 10% of WCL share capital for a xed price of 1.8 million.
After five years the Group will have the right to exercise a put option at a xed price of 1.8 million.
The combination of put and call options gives rise to near certainty of exercise and, along with the xed option price, provides evidence that this option in substance comprises deferred consideration on a further 10% of the ordinary shares of WCL.
In substance the Group has effected a disposal of 60% of the shares of WCL with 10% of the consideration being deferred.
The amount of deferred consideration recorded at 12 June 2010 after conversion into Sterling and appropriate discounting was 1.3 million.
The carrying amount at 31 March 2012 was 1.3 million 2011: 1.4 million.
The second option agreement granted an eight year call option to WMP over 20% of the WCL share capital for a price of 3.6 million adjusted for 20% of post-tax profits, excluding WCL share buy-back nancing costs.
After eight years the Group will have the right to exercise a put option based on the same pricing formula.
The swap was initially valued at 1.6 million and there have been no material movements in the valuation in the period to 31 March 2012.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 97 29 Business combinations and disposals continued The completion arrangements included a five year cheese supply agreement with the Group agreeing to buy minimum guaranteed cheese volumes based on a cost plus margin formula.
Volumes decrease over the five year agreement.
At the transaction date, 3.6 million was charged by the Group in order to provide for the cost of the cheese purchase arrangements.
The balance of this provision at 31 March 2012 was 2.3 million 2011: 3.0 million.
The disposal resulted in the release of non-controlling interests in WCL 2.8 million and in the reclassication to profit and loss of net investment hedges previously taken to other comprehensive income 1.7 million.
Furthermore the Group incurred 0.2 million on legal and professional fees in relation to this disposal.

30 Financial risk management objectives and policies The objective of the treasury function, which is accountable to the Board, is to manage the Groups and Companys financial risk, secure cost-effective funding for the Groups operations and to minimise the effects of uctuations in interest rates and exchange rates on the value of the Groups and Companys financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on cash ows.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans and overdrafts, loan notes, finance leases and cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The numbers 98 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The Group also enters into derivative transactions: principally interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2012, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, price risk and credit risk.
Information on how these risks arise is set out below, as are the objectives, policies and processes agreed by the Board for their management and the methods used to measure each risk.
Derivative instruments are used to change the economic characteristics of financial instruments in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in the Accounting Policies note.
Liquidity risk The Groups objectives are: to ensure that forecast peak net borrowings, plus a prudent operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature after at least 12 months: to ensure that prudent headroom versus bank and loan note covenant ratios are forecast for the next three years: to maintain exibility of funding by employing diverse sources of funds eg use of non-bank markets such as private placements : and to avoid a concentration of facility maturities in any particular year.
The maturity analysis of Group borrowings is set out in Note 19.
At 31 March 2012 the Groups total credit facilities amounted to 640.5 million 2011: 638.1 million excluding finance leases of 7.2 million 2011: 9.6 million and the impact of cross-currency swaps on US Dollar and Euro loan notes of 8.6 million 2011: 11.8 million.
The facilities at 31 March 2012 and 2011 consisted of: March 2012 170 million plus 150 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in October 2016: and loan notes totalling 345.5 million repayable between April 2013 and November 2021.
March 2011 85 million plus 175 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in July 2013: 100 million multi-currency revolving credit facility repayable at maturity in November 2011: and loan notes totalling 298.2 million repayable between April 2013 and April 2017.
Undrawn revolving credit facilities at 31 March 2012 amounted to 223.8 million 2011: 274.4 million.
This can be analysed as follows: 2012 2012 2011 2011 Drawn down Facility Drawn down Facility m m m m October 2011 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility 71.7 295.0 n a n a November 2006 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility n a n a 65.5 100.0 July 2008 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility n a n a 239.9 Total 71.7 295.0 65.5 339.9 Headroom 223.8 274.4 Cash and short term deposits 79.4 49.9 Effective headroom 303.2 324.3 The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by closely managing cash generation by its operating businesses and monitoring performance to budgets and forecasts.
Capital investment is carefully controlled, with detailed authorisation limits in place up to Executive level and cash payback criteria considered as part of the investment appraisal process.
Short-term and long-term cash and debt forecasts are constantly reviewed and there are regular treasury updates to the Executive highlighting facility headroom and net debt performance.
The increased focus on cash generation over the five years ended 31 March 2012 has resulted in signicantly lower levels of borrowings and increased facility headroom.
Day-to-day cash management utilises undrawn revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and occasionally short-term money market deposits if there is excess cash.
Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 99 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk for changes in market interest rates relate primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations with a oating interest rate.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of xed and variable rate debt.
The Groups long-term strategy is to keep between one third and three quarters of its borrowings at xed rates of interest in the medium term.
To manage this mix in a cost-efficient manner, the Group has issued xed coupon loan notes and also enters into interest rate swaps from time to time on a portion of its oating bank borrowings, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt interest cash ow obligations.
In the short-term the proportion of xed and oating rate borrowings can go outside the long-term range.
At 31 March 2012, 83% of the Groups borrowings were at a xed rate of interest 2011: 100%.
The proportion of xed interest borrowings is slightly higher than our long-term target, however the first tranche of loan notes is due to mature in April 2013 and with no need for additional facilities this will increase the amount drawn under revolving credit facilities at oating rates.
Therefore in the medium term we expect the xed proportion of borrowings to return to the target range.
The Groups borrowing facilities require minimum interest cover of 3.0 times.
The Groups exposure to interest rate risk is shown by way of a sensitivity analysis in Note 31.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the UK and also buys and sells a small amount of goods in currencies other than Sterling.
As a result the value of the Groups non-Sterling revenues, purchases, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates predominantly Euro Sterling.
The Group mitigates the effect of its structural currency exposures by borrowing to some extent in the same functional currency as the foreign operation into which it invests.
The foreign operation hedged in this way is St Hubert SAS France.
St Hubert is a Euro-denominated subsidiary.
Our policy is to hedge 100% of the inventories and tangible xed assets and 33% of goodwill and intangible assets exposure of overseas subsidiaries through borrowings and or cross-currency swaps in Euros.
At present, our only currency exposure is Euros.
At 31 March 2012 and 2011, all borrowings designated as a net investment hedge are done so on a pre-tax basis and no cross currency swaps are utilised as part of the hedging relationship.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the relevant entitys functional currency and therefore transaction exposures are limited.
It can be seen in Note 16 that the only significant non-Sterling debtors are in Euros and these predominantly relate to the functional currency of St Hubert.
The Group trades skimmed milk products and bulk butter mainly to customers in Europe and Central and South America.
The Group also exports its own skimmed milk products, bulk butter and other branded products.
The Groups policy requires foreign currency sales and purchases through Philpot Dairy Products Limited, a subsidiary company, to be hedged by foreign exchange contracts once the transaction is committed so that the margin on the transaction can be xed.
There are currently no sales between the UK business and St Hubert.
Currency exposures on other transactions, such as certain capital expenditure denominated in a foreign currency, are hedged following approval of the project using forward foreign exchange contracts.
In 2006, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US with a face value of $233 million.
At the same time, cross-currency swaps were implemented to hedge the interest and principal repayment cash ows.
These have the effect of xing the liability in Sterling at 133.0 million.
The principal amount and interest and principal payment dates on these swaps match those on the loan notes exactly and all swaps are with counterparties with strong credit ratings.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to $US debts as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassication of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
In 2009, the Group entered into cross-currency swaps on 75 million of its loan notes denominated in Euros in order to hedge the future interest and principal repayment cash ows.
This has the effect of xing the liability in Sterling at 67.0 million.
There is no profit and loss exposure in relation to this 75 million of debt as any retranslation impact on the profit and loss account is offset by reclassication of amounts from other comprehensive income into profit and loss.
In November 2011, the Group issued loan notes denominated in $US with a face value of $85 million.
These have the effect of xing the liability in Sterling at 54.5 million.
The numbers 100 Dairy Crest Annual Report 2012 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Price risk The Group is exposed to price risk related to certain commodities and their by-products used by the Groups businesses.
The principal non-milk commodities that affect input prices for the Group are vegetable oils, gas, electricity, diesel, heavy fuel oil and crude oil by-products used in packaging.
The Group monitors prices on an ongoing basis in order to assess the impact that movements have on profitability and to assess whether the amount of forward cover is appropriate.
This includes vegetable oil contracts and energy, which is generally contracted one season in advance for both Summer and Winter energy but with some requirement contracted at more regular intervals.
The Group regularly reviews relevant commodity markets and levels of future cover.
Fixed price contracts are only entered into with the approval of the Commodity Risk Committee comprising senior operational and finance management and external advisers.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
The Group only offers these terms to recognized, creditworthy third parties.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups history of bad debt losses is not significant.
In the year ended 31 March 2012 one customer, Quadra Foods Limited, went into administration and the outstanding balance of 4.3 million has been fully provided.
The material size of this provision and the one-off nature of bad debts of this kind has resulted in this provision being charged to exceptional items see Note 4.
The Dairies doorstep business trades with individuals and receives cash payments on a weekly basis.
Cash and debt management is a crucial part of this business and cash collection and balances due are closely monitored to ensure write-downs are minimised.
Debtor days outstanding are closely monitored throughout the year and action is taken promptly when payment terms are breached.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, trade and other debtors excludes prepayments and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The maximum exposure for the Group is equal to the carrying amount of these financial assets of 223.5 million 2011: 212.0 million.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk.
All borrowings are through banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above.
Funds temporarily surplus to business requirements are invested overnight through deposit accounts with mainstream UK commercial banks with a credit rating of A or better.
The Group currently has no requirement to place deposits for a longer period, accordingly counterparty risk is considered to be acceptable.
Derivative financial instruments are contracted with a range of banks with long-term credit ratings of A or above to avoid excessive concentration of financial instruments with one counterparty.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains an appropriate level of gearing in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
In addition, the Group monitors its forecast net debt to EBITDA ratios in order that they are comfortably within its banking covenant requirements.
The maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio for the purposes of bank covenants is 3.5 times.
At 31 March 2012 the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 2.2 times March 2011:2.2 times.
The Group monitors its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions or changes in Group structure.
Possible mechanisms for changing capital structure include adjusting the level of dividends, issuance of new shares or returning capital to shareholders.
No significant changes in capital structure have been implemented in the year ended 31 March 2012 or 2011.
There have been no changes in the objectives, policies and procedures during the last two years.
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by shareholders funds.
The analysis of net debt is included in Note 33.
The gearing ratio at March 2012 and 2011 can be analysed as follows: 2012 2011 m m Net debt 336.4 311.6 Shareholders funds 274.3 365.5 Gearing ratio 123% 85% Dividends Details of dividends paid and proposed during the year are given in Note 7.
The dividend policy is to maintain a progressive dividend whilst seeking to maintain a level of dividend cover between 2.0 and 2.5 times.
The final proposed dividend for 2011 12 is 14.7 pence representing a 3.5% increase on last year 2011: 14.2 pence.
Total dividends paid and proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2012 amount to 20.4 pence, representing an increase of 3.6% 2011: 19.7 pence.

Interest on financial instruments classied as oating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classied as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on oating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity resulting from movements in interest rates other than in relation to the $US GBP and EUR GBP cross-currency swaps used as a cash ow hedge on $US and EUR loan notes.
The impact on equity is nil over the life of the instruments as these swaps comprise an effective hedge.
At 31 March 2012 83% of Group borrowings were at xed rates of interest 2011: 100% see Note 30.
The sensitivity analysis excludes all non-derivative xed rate financial instruments carried at amortised cost but includes non-derivative oating rate financial instruments except those where interest rate swaps have been used as cash ow hedges.
This is due to the fact that gains and losses on the hedging instrument offset losses and gains on the non-derivative oating rate financial instrument which are subject to the hedge and are matched in both profit and loss and cash terms.
No non-derivative xed rate financial instruments have profit and loss exposure due to oating rates as a result of interest rate swaps.
The 2012 analysis below reects similar reasonably possible changes in interest rates to 2011 upside LIBOR expectations assumed last year were not realised but are still expected at March 2012.

The fair value of interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts has been determined by the third party financial institution with whom the Group holds the instrument, in line with the market value of similar instruments.
The fair value of borrowings has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.

Interest rate swaps were previously designated as cash ow hedges and met the criteria for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2011 the xed interest rates varied from 4.045% to 4.053%.
The oating rate of interest on the receipt leg of these swaps was EURIBOR.

These cross currency swaps have both legs at xed interest rates, are designated as cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
The gain deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next one to ten years being the life of the swaps.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding EUR GBP cross currency swap contracts at 31 March 2012 was 75.0 million 67.0 million 2011: 75.0 million: 67.0 million.
At 31 March 2012 and 2011 the xed interest rates varied from 4.955% to 5.180%.
The loss deferred in equity will reverse in the income statement operating costs during the next two to three years being the life of the swaps.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro denominated borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net asset investment in St Hubert SAS, its subsidiary in France.
The fair value of the Euro borrowings at 31 March 2012 was 124.2 million 2011: 131.9 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 7.7 million 2011: 1.0 million on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognized in other comprehensive income.
Forward currency contracts The Group has entered into certain forward currency contracts in order to hedge the Sterling cost of currency-denominated future purchases and receipts.
These forward currency purchases have been designated cash ow hedges and meet the criteria for hedge accounting.
They all have a duration of less than one year and any gains or losses deferred will then be reclassied to the income statement operating costs.
Borrowing facilities The Group has undrawn committed long-term borrowing facilities available at 31 March 2012 of 223.8 million 2011: 274.4 million in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date.

This business forms part of the Spreads reportable segment.
S ince its acquisition in January 2007, St Hubert has consistently increased its market share and profitability.
However, the Group has been unable to make additional synergistic acquisitions in Continental Europe as it envisaged at the time of acquisition and believes that greater value may be generated for shareholders through the consideration of all available options for the business.
This review is ongoing and is evaluating all possible options available to maximise shareholder value including potential divestment.
A disposal would reduce the Groups debt and provide a number of alternatives including releasing some proceeds to shareholders, investing in our core business and making strategic acquisitions of branded dairy and chilled foods businesses in the UK.
Any disposal would be likely to occur within the next 12 months and would be subject to shareholder approval.
