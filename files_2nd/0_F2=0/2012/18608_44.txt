The group works in an open and transparent manner and maintains a regular dialogue with HM Revenue & Customs.
This approach is consistent with the low risk rating we have been awarded by HM Revenue & Customs and to which the group is committed.

In addition to the above the group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the carrying value of trading properties in the statement of financial position and their market value.
This contingent tax, which is not provided in the accounts, amounts to 82.9m 2011: 84.9m.
No benefit has been recognised in respect of unused tax credits with a tax value of nil 2011: nil : unexpired trading losses carried forward with a tax value of 2.1m 2011: 2.3m : or deductible temporary differences with a tax value of 1.3m 2011: nil.
It is not possible for the group to identify the timing of movements in deferred tax between those expected within one year and those expected in greater than one year.
This is because movements in the main balances, both assets and liabilities, will be determined by factors outside the control of the group, namely the vacation date of properties and interest yield curve movements.
However, given the long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.

Accordingly the groups results for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 25% and should be taxed at 23.5% in the 2013 period.
The change in tax rate has resulted in a 0.2m charge to the income statement in the current year.
