Risk disclosures continued A breakdown of the Groups exposure to sovereign debt is set out below: 2012 2011 m m Investments in sovereign debt France 20.8 US 342.1 433.7 Germany 300.0 316.0 The Netherlands 12.1 Canada 51.6 60.8 Australia 74.2 45.6 Italy 50.3 62.7 Spain 75.6 52.6 Other 94.2 170.3 Total sovereign debt 1,000.1 1,162.5 Note: The Groups investments in sovereign debt issued by Portugal, Republic of Ireland and Greece were nil 2011: nil.
Sovereign debt is included in the asset allocation table under government securities, government index-linked securities, government agencies guaranteed assets, supranational bonds and within the underlying holdings of pooled vehicles.
Included in the investments in sovereign debt of Italy and Spain disclosed above are investments in short-duration treasury bills of 36.9 million and 57.5 million respectively 2011: 49.8 million and 41.6 million respectively.
The Group continues to monitor developments in the Eurozone and take action to manage its exposure as required.
The impact of a number of different scenarios has been considered, with appropriate contingency plans determined.
3.3 Fair value methodology For financial instruments carried at fair value the Group has categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
An active market is one in which transactions for the asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide readily and regularly available quoted prices.
Level 2 Inputs to a valuation model other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 Inputs to a valuation model for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs and are significant to the overall fair value measurement.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions it is considered that market participants would use in pricing the asset.
Shares and other variable yield securities Listed equities traded on a primary exchange in an active market are classified as Level 1.
Unlisted equities are valued using internal models, based principally upon managements assumptions and are classified as Level 3.
Debt and other fixed income securities The fair value is based upon quotes from pricing services where available.
These pricing services derive prices based on an average of quotes provided by brokers.
Where multiple quotes are not available, the fair value is based upon evaluated pricing services, which typically use proprietary cash flow models and incorporate observable market inputs, such as credit spreads, benchmark quotes and other trade data.
If such services do not provide coverage of the asset, then fair value is determined manually using indicative broker quotes, which are corroborated by recent market transactions in similar or identical assets.
Where there is an active market for these assets and their fair value is the unadjusted quoted market price, these are classified as Level 1.
This is typically the case for government bonds.
Level 1 also includes bond funds, where fair value is based upon quoted prices.
Where the market is inactive or the price is adjusted, but significant market observable inputs have been used by the pricing sources, then these are considered to be Level 2 inputs.
This is typically the case for government agency debt, corporate debt, mortgage and asset backed securities and catastrophe bonds.
Certain assets, for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable, are classified as Level 3.
Property funds The fair value is based upon valuations provided by the fund manager.
The inputs into that valuation are primarily unobservable and, as such, these assets are classified as Level 3.
Participation in investment pools These are investment funds and the value is based upon unadjusted, quoted and executable prices provided by the fund manager and these are classified as Level 1.
138 138 Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Strategic overview Performance Governance Financial statements Derivatives Listed derivative contracts, such as futures, that are actively traded are valued using quoted prices from the relevant exchange and are classified as Level 1.
Over-the-counter currency options are valued by the counterparty using quantitative models with multiple market inputs.
The market inputs are observable and the valuation can be validated through external sources.
These are classified as Level 2.
Certain derivatives for which prices or other market inputs are unobservable are classified as Level 3.
This is typically the case for certain catastrophe linked instruments.

The Group holds 4.1% 2011 restated: 3.1% of its net financial investments at a fair value based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
While such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.
