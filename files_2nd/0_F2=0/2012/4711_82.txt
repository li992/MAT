Risk management The groups funding, liquidity and exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risks are managed by the groups treasury department.
The treasury department uses a range of financial instruments to manage these underlying risks.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of board approved policies and guidelines, which are recommended and subsequently monitored by the finance committee.
This committee is described in the corporate governance report.
The policies and guidelines include benchmark exposure and or hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The benchmarks, hedge cover levels and overall appropriateness of Diageos risk management policies are reviewed by the board following, for example, significant business, strategic or accounting changes.
The framework provides for limited defined levels of flexibility in execution to allow for the optimal application of the board-approved strategies.
Transactions arising on the application of this flexibility may give rise to exposures different from the defined benchmark levels that are separately monitored on a daily basis using value at risk analysis.
These transactions are carried at fair value and gains or losses are taken to the income statement as they arise.
