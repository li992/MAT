Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: s Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: s Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and s Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 29 April 2012, the only financial instruments were Derivative financial assets, which are classied as Level 2, and Available-for-sale financial assets, which are classied as Level 1.
100 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES notes to the Financial Statements For the 53 weeks ended 29 April 2012 27.
Financial Instruments Continued b Derivatives: foreign currency forward purchase contracts The most significant exposure to foreign exchange uctuations relates to purchases made in foreign currencies, principally the US dollar.
The Groups policy is to reduce substantially the risk associated with foreign currency spot rates by using forward xed rate currency purchase contracts, taking into account any foreign currency cash ows.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes, however if derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting they are accounted for as such and accordingly any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying values of forward foreign currency purchase contracts were as follows: 29 April 2012 24 April 2011 000 000 Fair value of derivative financial instruments - assets liabilities 4,356 5,984 The Sterling principal amounts of forward foreign currency purchase contracts and contracted forward rates were as follows: 29 April 2012 24 April 2011 000 000 US dollar purchases 371,986 320,000 Contracted rates 1.61-1.65 1.56-1.65 US dollar sales 40,000 - Contracted rates 1.53-1.54 - Euro sales 24,678 33,451 Contracted rates 1.13-1.14 1.13-1.14 At 29 April 2012 372m of forward US dollar purchase contracts qualied for hedge accounting and the loss on fair valuation of these contracts of 6.8m has therefore been recognised in other comprehensive income.
This amount is split between a loss of 1.3m recognised in the period, a gain of 5.8m reclassied and reported in net profit and a gain of 2.2m recognised in inventories.
Forward foreign currency purchase and sale contracts generally have a maturity at inception of approximately 12 months.
At 29 April 2012 60m of purchase contracts and 3.5m of sale contracts had a maturity at inception of greater than 12 months 2011: 60 million of purchase contracts.
c Sensitivity analysis Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Groups principal foreign currency exposures are to US dollars and the Euro.
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Groups reported profit and equity to a 5% increase and decrease in the US dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain unchanged.
The gures have been calculated by comparing the fair values of outstanding foreign currency contracts at the current exchange rate to those if exchange rates moved as illustrated.
The income statement gures include the profit effect of any relevant derivatives which are not in a designated cash ow hedge.
The impact on US dollar related hedging instruments is included in equity.
Positive gures represent an increase decrease in profit or equity: Income statement Equity 29 April 2012 24 April 2011 29 April 2012 24 April 2011 000 000 000 000 Sterling strengthens by 5% US dollar 810 849 4,284 3,674 Euro 559 219 559 219 Sterling weakens by 5% US dollar 851 892 4,498 3,858 Euro 587 230 587 230
