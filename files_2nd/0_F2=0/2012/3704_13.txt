Revenue in Australia benefited from increased flying activity for QantasLink and for the mining and energy sectors.
The margin including joint ventures decreased to 11.6% 2011: 13.5%, in part due to the low margin on the FSTA conversion work and redundancy costs, including reductions in administrative and other positions, primarily incurred in the first half.
