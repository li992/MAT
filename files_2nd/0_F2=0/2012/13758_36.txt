to this scheme are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the hedging relationship.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the company is required todocument the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
The company is also required to document and demonstrate that the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument will be highly effective.
This effectiveness test is reperformed at each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained and will continue to remain highly effective.
The company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair valuehedge or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions orcommitments cash flow hedge.
Where a derivative ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedging instrument or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold, matures or is extinguished, hedge accounting is discontinued and amounts previously recorded in equity are recycled to the profit and loss account.
A similar treatment is applied where the hedge is of a future transaction and that transaction is no longer likely to occur.
When the hedge is discontinued due to ineffectiveness, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
Certain derivative instruments, whilst providing effective economic hedges under the companys policies, are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
