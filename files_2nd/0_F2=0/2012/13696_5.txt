Business Review 2012 Results Results PBTA was at the top end of market expectations at 60.1 million 2011: 50.8 million.
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 19.48 pence 2011: 16.68 pence.
The contribution of each segment grew significantly: Underlying Profit m 2012 2011 Energy 39.7 32.1 24% Built and Natural Environment 31.8 29.0 10% Total 71.6 61.1 17% as defined in note 1 g to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Energy activities are largely conducted on a worldwide basis.
In combination with our Built and Natural Environment business in Australia Asia Pacific, we now have over 70% of our underlying profit generated outside Europe.
During 2012 this generally exposed us to higher growth economies and good opportunities.
A significant proportion of our Built and Natural Environment activity relates to projects providing the infrastructure necessary to process and deliver energy and power resources.
Consequently, we estimate that approximately 70% of our underlying profit is now earned in the global Energy and associated infrastructure markets.
Cash Flow, Funding and Dividend The Group continued its excellent conversion of profit into cash.
Adjusted operating cash flow was 76.0 million 2011: 71.1 million.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with no defined benefit pension schemes or historic pension liabilities.
We have bank facilities of 125 million available until July 2016.
These comprise a 75 million committed facility, with an additional 50 million available as required.
The cost of these facilities remains at a low level.
Net bank borrowings at the year end were 13.5 million 2011: 23.5 million, after investing 24.2 million in acquisitions 2011: 27.2 million.
We remain well positioned to continue to fund the Groups growth strategy.
The Board continues to be confident about the Groups financial strength and is recommending a final dividend of 3.34 pence per share payable on 24 May 2013 to shareholders on the register on 12 April 2013.
If approved the total dividend for the full year would be 6.40 pence per share, an increase of 15% 2011: 5.56 pence per share.
Our dividend has risen at about this rate for 19 consecutive years.
It increased 75% over the 4 years of the global financial crisis, whilst our net debt has reduced substantially, to an 8 year low, after investing 120.6 million in acquisitions in the same period.
Markets and Trading Energy We provide internationally recognised consultancy services to the energy sector from bases in the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and Asia.
These act as regional centres for projects undertaken in many other countries.

As anticipated, this business continued to make good progress in the final months of the year.
Our clients investment in conventional oil and gas exploration and production was generally strong throughout the year.
Our activity in the unconventionals market remained buoyant internationally, with a shift from shale gas to liquids in the USA.
We experienced an encouraging uplift in activity in most parts of the world and continued to see a particularly strong performance in the US.
This was based on both domestic and international projects, including good activity levels in the Gulf of Mexico.
Following last years political disturbances, our activity in North Africa was subdued throughout 2012, although opportunities elsewhere in Africa and parts of the Middle East continued to improve.
