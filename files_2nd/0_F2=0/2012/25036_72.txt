FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Equity market price risk: Responsibility for risk management, including financial risks, resides at all levels within the Group, starting with the Board.
The most significant market risk faced by the Group is on equity positions, including shares and indices, which are highly correlated and Our Corporate Governance Framework, including details of how the Board delegates responsibility for internal control and risk managed on a portfolio basis.
management to our Audit and Risk Committees, is described in detail in the Corporate Governance section.

Financial risks arising from financial instruments are analysed into market, credit, concentration and liquidity risks, and these are discussed below.

Changes in risk variables have no direct impact on the Groups equity, as the Group has no financial instruments classied as available for sale, or designated in hedging relationships.
The Groups market risk is managed under the market risk policy on a group-wide basis, and exposure to market risk at any point in time depends primarily on short-term market conditions and the levels of client activity.

Exposure limits are set by the Risk Committee for each product, and also for groups of products where it is considered that their price movements are likely to be positively correlated.
The Groups market risk policy incorporates a methodology for setting market position limits, consistent with the Groups risk appetite, for each financial market in which the Groups clients can trade, as well as certain markets which the Board consider to be correlated.
The exposure to interest rate derivatives and commodities at the year-end is as follows: These limits are determined with reference to the liquidity and volatility of the underlying financial product or asset class, and represent 2012 2011 the maximum long and short client exposure that the Group will hold without hedging the net client exposure.

Client credit risk principally arises when a clients total funds deposited with the Group are insucient to cover any trading losses incurred.
In addition, a small number of clients are granted credit limits to cover open losses and margin requirements as described below.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis A non-traded interest rate risk sensitivity analysis has been performed on net interest income on segregated client funds, based on the In particular, client credit risk can arise where there are significant, sudden movements in the market, ie due to high general market volatility or value of client funds held at the year-end, on the basis of a 0.25% 2011: 0.25% per annum fall and a 0.75% 2011: 0.75% rise in interest specic volatility relating to an individual financial instrument in which the client has an open position.
