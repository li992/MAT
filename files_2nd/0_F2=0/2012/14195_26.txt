The Company has instructed independent third parties to purchase the shares of the Company up to a maximum value of $500m.
These contracts can be canceled at any time other than when the Company is in a financial close or other prohibited period.

Accretion of the discount is recorded in the profit and loss during the close or other prohibited period.
Shares purchased in the close period or other prohibited are deducted from the liability and recorded as treasury shares with any remaining liability on leaving the close or other prohibited period is reversed with a credit recognised in shareholder equity.
On 31 December 2012 the Company was not in a financial close or other prohibited period and accordingly not committed to its contracts for purchasing shares.
Therefore no liability has been recognised as at 31 December 2012.
