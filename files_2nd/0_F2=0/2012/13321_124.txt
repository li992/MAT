Business Review Governance Financial Statements Rentokil Initial plc Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements Notes to the Accounts 107 Fair value hierarchy of derivative financial instruments For all financial instruments held by the group, those that are held at fair value are to be classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group holds all derivatives at fair value using discounted cash flow models based on market rates which are observable.
Therefore all derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale assets held by the group fall into Level 2.
Contingent consideration payable by the group falls into Level 3.
No financial instruments have moved between levels in the year.
The table below analyses the groups derivative financial instruments, which will be settled on a gross basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and so may not reconcile to the balance sheet.
