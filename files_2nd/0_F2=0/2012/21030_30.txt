The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme Option Scheme The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000.
Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of ten years and vest after five years from date of grant.
The pro rata proportion of the fair value of options at each reporting year end has been accounted for on an equitysettled basis.
No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options, phantoms and or nil cost options to employees.
The Plan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares.
These elements can be used singly or in combination.
Awards granted under the Omnibus plan typically vest after five years from date of grant, with the exception of bonus awards which vest after the shorter of five years from date of grant or on the date of termination of employment.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan are accounted for as equity settled, with the exception of phantoms which are classified as cash settled.
The Approved Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding 30,000 per employee.
The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC.
To date, there have been no awards made under the CSOP.
The share-based payments relating to the Omnibus Plan represent the combined cash and equity settled payments.

Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 73 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Share-based payments continued Where the grant of restricted and matching share awards is linked to the annual bonus process the fair value of the awards is spread over a period including the current financial year and the subsequent five years to their release date when the grantee becomes unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
Of the total outstanding share awards of 30,097,672 as at 30 June 2012 25,555,448 as at 30 June 2011 the amount of 23,890,685 2011: 19,630,824 were restricted and matching shares granted as part of the Groups variable compensation process.
The fair value of the remaining awards is spread over the period from date of grant to the release date.
Acquisition of AshmoreEMM On acquisition of AshmoreEMM, employees and management held unvested shares representing 17.9% of its partnership shares.
These awards, which vest after five years depending on the satisfaction of service conditions, are accounted for as equity settled share-based payments in accordance with IFRS 2 which results in an annual charge to the income statement during the period of vesting.
Upon vesting, the holders are entitled to receive AshmoreEMM shares which may be exchanged for shares in Ashmore Group plc or cash at the discretion of the Group.
The grant date fair value was based on the intrinsic value proportionate with the value implied from the purchase consideration paid by the Group to acquire AshmoreEMM.
No awards were granted or vested 2011: none during the year.
25,097 awards 2011: none were forfeited during the year and 2,294,453 2011: 2,300,000 awards are outstanding as at year end.

On 10 September 2012 the Board proposed a final dividend of 10.75p per share for the year ended 30 June 2012.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be 73.7 million 2011: 72.2 million.

Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 13 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Goodwill Company m Cost At the beginning and end of the year 4.1 Net book value at 30 June 2011 and 2012 4.1 Goodwill The goodwill balance within the Group relates principally to the acquisition of AshmoreEMM in May 2011.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and the end of the year was 4.1 million and related to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.
Additional goodwill arising in the Group at the beginning of the year relates to the Dolomite acquisition in 2008.
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes.
The Group considers itself to have one cash-generating unit to which goodwill is allocated.
Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on managements judgements regarding the future prospects of the business, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.
When assessing the appropriateness of the carrying value of goodwill at year end, the recoverable amount is considered to be the greater of fair value less costs to sell or value in use calculations.
The calculation is based on the forecast future profitability and cash flow projections of the cash-generating unit over a 10-year period which management believes is the most appropriate timescale to review and consider performance.
The discount rate applied is based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital.
The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken at 31 May 2012.
No impairments were deemed necessary.
AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name The AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name are separately identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of AshmoreEMM in May 2011.
Ashmore engaged an independent third-party valuation expert to value these assets as part of the acquisition.
They were valued at the present value of the expected future cash flows resulting from the assets over their useful lives and were discounted using the Group weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%.
They are being amortised over their useful lives which were also estimated based on the work of the valuation expert.
Their estimated useful lives are eight years for the fund management relationships and 10 years for the AshmoreEMM brand name.
The fund management relationships intangible comprises the profit expected to be earned from existing clients of AshmoreEMM.
The AshmoreEMM brand name is being actively used through the co-branding of the subsidiary since its acquisition.
The carrying amounts of the assets in the balance sheet are based on their historic costs less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets In addition, in order to incentivise Amundi, who were formerly a shareholder in AshmoreEMM, to retain existing AuM within the business and to further increase AuM there is an incentive fee payable after three years tied to the level of such AuM at that time.
As the purpose of this is to benefit the Group going forward, a corresponding intangible asset was recognised.
During the year to 30 June 2012 there has been a downward adjustment to the net present value of the incentive fee payable to Amundi at the end of the agreement.
Consequently management have concluded that the associated intangible asset is impaired.
An impairment charge of 1.2 million for the year to 30 June 2012 has been included within other expenses in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income, reducing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its recoverable amount.

The rate reduction is reflected in the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the figures above.
The 2012 Budget on 21 March 2012 announced that the UK corporation tax rate is set to reduce further to 22% by 2014.
Whilst a reduction to a rate of 22% has not yet been substantively enacted, a further reduction to a rate of 23% effective from 1 April 2013 was substantively enacted on 3 July 2012.
The overall effect of a further tax reduction from 24% to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance above as at 30 June 2012, would be to further decrease the Group deferred tax assets by approximately 0.6 million and the Company deferred tax assets by 0.6 million.
78 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 17 Fair value of financial instruments There is no material difference between the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and their fair values.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by reference to published price quotations Level 2 inputs.
Fair value hierarchy The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1: Valuation is based upon a quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques are based upon observable inputs, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Valuation techniques use significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy of financial instruments which are carried at fair value as at 30 June is summarised below: 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial assets at fair value Investment securities 27.8 32.8 60.6 Derivative financial instruments 0.5 0.5 Non-current assets held-for-sale 49.9 49.9 59.0 59.0 Available-for-sale financial assets 0.4 54.2 54.6 41.4 41.4 Non-current asset investments 5.6 5.6 3.5 3.5 Total financial assets 28.2 143.0 171.2 103.9 103.9 2012 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Financial liabilities at fair value Third-party interests in consolidated funds 4.8 5.7 10.5 Derivative financial instruments 1.5 1.5 0.6 0.6 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 15.1 15.1 12.8 12.8 Contingent consideration 10.7 10.7 32.0 32.0 Total financial liabilities 4.8 22.3 10.7 37.8 13.4 32.0 45.4 There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year 2011: none.
The valuation techniques used to estimate the fair value of contingent consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of AshmoreEMM are described in note 29.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 79 Notes to the financial statements continued 18 Seed capital investments a Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, the fund is classified as being held-for-sale.

Investments cease to be classified as held-for-sale when they are no longer controlled by the Group.
A loss of control may happen either through sale of the investment and or dilution of the Groups holding.
When investments cease to be classified as held-for-sale they are classified as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 see below.

Fair value is assessed by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors subscribing to the fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred.
Included within finance income is 0.7 million of unrealised gains on the Groups non-current asset investments.
80 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 19 Financial instrument risk management Group The Group is subject to strategic, business, investment, operational and treasury risks throughout its business as discussed in the Business Review.
This note provides further detail on the Groups exposure to and the management of risks derived from the financial instruments it uses.
Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
The Ashmore Group Risk Management and Control department, the Groups Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit and Risk Committee are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment which seeks to ensure that risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, as a regulated business the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the development of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, based upon the Financial Services Authoritys methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive.
An overview of the ICAAP can be found on our website at www.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Credit risk The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2012 and 30 June 2011 are as follows: 2012 2011 Notes m m Investment securities 18 60.6 Derivative financial instruments 0.5 Non-current assets held-for-sale 18 49.9 59.0 Available-for-sale financial assets 18 54.6 41.4 Cash and cash equivalents 346.6 369.0 Total excluding trade and other receivables 512.2 469.4 Trade and other receivables 15 64.1 68.2 Total 576.3 537.6 At 30 June 2012 there were no overdue trade and other receivables 2011: none.
All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully recoverable.
Cash and cash equivalents The Groups cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits with banks and liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging from A to AAAm as at 30 June 2012 2011: A to AAAm.
Trade and other receivables at amortised cost Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
Financial assets held at fair value Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments, investment securities, non-current assets held-for-sale and available-for-sale financial assets.
These assets expose the Group to credit risk from varied counterparties which is monitored and reviewed by the Groups risk management team.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
In order to manage inherent liquidity risk there is a liquidity policy within the Group to ensure that there is sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 81 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial instrument risk management continued The maturity profile of the Groups contractual undiscounted financial liabilities is as follows: As at 30 June 2012: Liability maturity date m 1 year 1-5 years 5years Total Third-party interests in consolidated funds 10.5 10.5 Derivative financial instruments 1.5 1.5 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 15.1 15.1 Trade and other payables 85.7 85.7 Non-current trade and other payables 7.2 7.2 Total financial liabilities 112.8 7.2 120.0 As at 30 June 2011: Liability maturity date m 1 year 1-5 years 5years Total Third-party interests in consolidated funds Derivative financial instruments 0.6 0.6 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 12.8 12.8 Trade and other payables 94.9 94.9 Non-current trade and other payables 21.4 21.4 Total financial liabilities 108.3 21.4 129.7 Details on leases and other commitments are provided in notes 24 and 27.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
This exposure is monitored by management on a continuing basis.
At 30 June 2012, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher or 50 basis points lower 2011: 200 basis points higher or 40 basis points lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.7 million higher 1.7 million lower 2011: 7.5 million higher 1.5 million lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.
Effective interest rates applicable to financial instruments are as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2012 2011 % % Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.79 0.40 Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2012 2011 m m Items repricing within one year or less: Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 346.6 369.0 The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk through debt securities held in consolidated seed funds.

82 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups revenue is almost entirely denominated in US dollars, whilst the majority of the Groups cost are Sterling-based.
Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$ exchange rate.
In addition, the Group operates globally which means that it may enter into contracts and other arrangements denominated in local currencies in various geographic areas.
The Groups policy is to hedge significant foreign exchange exposures by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and or options for up to two years forward.
The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in the following currencies: As at 30 June 2012: Sterling US dollar Brazilian Real Other Total Notes m m m m m Financial assets Investment securities 18 0.3 8.9 21.8 29.6 60.6 Derivative financial instruments 0.5 0.5 Non-current assets held-for-sale 18 49.9 49.9 Available-for-sale financial assets 18 54.6 54.6 Trade and other receivables 15 8.7 52.4 1.5 1.5 64.1 Cash and cash equivalents 239.3 100.8 1.3 5.2 346.6 Total financial assets 248.3 267.1 24.6 36.3 576.3 Sterling US dollar Brazilian Real Other Total Notes m m m m m Financial liabilities Third-party interests in consolidated funds 18 1.5 3.7 5.3 10.5 Derivative financial instruments 1.5 1.5 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 18 15.1 15.1 Trade and other payables 23 45.8 39.6 0.5 1.2 87.1 Non-current trade and other payables 23 5.8 5.8 Total financial liabilities 45.8 63.5 4.2 6.5 120.0 As at 30 June 2011: Sterling US dollar Brazilian Real Other Total Notes m m m m m Financial assets Non-current assets held-for-sale 18 41.4 17.6 59.0 Available-for-sale financial assets 18 41.4 41.4 Trade and other receivables 15 10.5 54.6 1.7 1.4 68.2 Cash and cash equivalents 302.0 63.9 3.1 369.0 Total financial assets 312.5 201.3 19.3 4.5 537.6 Sterling US dollar Brazilian Real Other Total Notes m m m m m Financial liabilities Derivative financial instruments 0.6 0.6 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 18 7.1 5.7 12.8 Trade and other payables 23 46.8 47.2 0.9 94.9 Non-current trade and other payables 23 21.4 21.4 Total financial liabilities 46.8 76.3 5.7 0.9 129.7 At 30 June 2012, if the US dollar had strengthened weakened by 10 cents against Sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would have increased decreased by 7.4 million 6.5 million respectively 2011: 3.5million 3.1 million.
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments which are denominated mainly in either US dollars or Brazilian Real.
Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk.
At 30 June 2012, if the Brazilian Real, US dollar and other currencies had, in aggregate, strengthened weakened by one per cent against Sterling with all other variables held constant, the impact on net assets as a result of the Groups seed capital positions would have been an increase decrease of 1.4 million 1.4 million 2011: 0.9 million 0.9million.
The impact on profit before tax would have been an increase decrease of 0.5 million 0.5 million 2011: nil.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial instrument risk management continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Groups direct exposure to price risk is primarily in respect of seed capital investments.
Seed capital interests classified as available-for-sale or non-current asset investments are held at fair value and are directly impacted by market price movements whilst those classified as held-forsale or investment securities, derivative financial instruments and other assets and liabilities expose the Group to market changes indirectly either through line by line consolidation of underlying financial performance and positions or potential impairments when fair value less costs to sell are less than carrying amounts.
At 30 June 2012, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have had a 7.3 million 2011: 4.4 million impact on net assets.
The impact on profit before tax would have been 3.3 million 2011: nil.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Groups management fees which are based on a percentage of value of AuM and fees based on performance.
Movements in market prices, exchange and interest rates could cause the AuM to fluctuate which in turn could affect fees earned.
However, these fees are diversified across a range of investment themes and are not measurably correlated to any single market indices in Emerging Markets.
Based on the year end assets under management of US$63.7 billion, and the years average net management fee rate of 74bps, a 5% movement in assets under management would have a US$23.6 million impact on management fee revenues 2011: based on assets under management of $65.8 billion and an average net management fee rate of 80bps, a 5% movement in assets under management would have had a US$26.3 million impact on management fee revenues.
Performance fee revenues could be reduced in severe market conditions, however, throughout Ashmores history the policy of having funds with year ends staged throughout the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline, some performance fees have still been recorded.
The profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction of the variable compensation paid to employees.
Hedging activities The Group uses forward exchange contracts and options to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
These hedges protect a proportion of the Groups revenue cash flows from foreign exchange movements and occur consistently throughout the year.
The options and forward contracts have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges as at 30 June 2012.
When hedges are assessed as effective, intrinsic value gains and losses are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and later reclassified to comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.
A 0.1 million intrinsic gain 2011: 0.1 million loss on the Groups hedges has been recognised through other comprehensive income and no intrinsic value 2011: nil was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year.
The cumulative fair value of the outstanding foreign exchange hedges liability at 30 June 2012 was 1.3 million 2011: 0.6 million and is included within the Groups derivative financial instrument liabilities.
Time value in relation to the Groups hedges is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, the net unrealised loss related to the time value of the hedges is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year.
Included within the realised and unrealised hedging gains of 0.1 million note 4 recognised at 30 June 2012 1.8 million gain at 30 June 2011 are: a 0.5 million loss in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ending 30 June 2013 2011: 1.3 million gain in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ended 30 June 2012 : and a 0.6 million gain in respect of crystallised foreign exchange contracts 2011: 0.5 million gain.

There are no other assets managed which are considered capital of the Group.
As referred to above, the Group monitors its regulatory capital in order to meet the financial resources requirements of the Financial Services Authority.
Company The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk as at 30 June 2012 are as follows: 2012 2011 Note m m Financial assets Trade and other receivables 15 232.5 143.9 Cash and cash equivalents 210.6 231.2 Total financial assets 443.1 375.1 At 30 June 2012 there were nil overdue trade and other receivables 2011: none.
The Companys cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits with banks or liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging from A to AAAm as at 30 June 2012 2011: A to AAAm.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The liquidity policy is to ensure that the Company has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 85 Notes to the financial statements continued 19 Financial instrument risk management continued The table below analyses the Companys financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year unless otherwise disclosed.

The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
At 30 June 2012, if interest rates over the year had been 50 basis points higher 50 basis points lower 2011: 200 basis points higher 29 basis points lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.7 million higher 0.7 million lower 2011: 3.1 million higher 0.5 million lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.
Effective interest rates applicable to financial instruments are as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2012 2011 % % Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.61 0.29 Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2012 2011 m m Items repricing within one year or less: Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 210.6 231.2 Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Other than intercompany balances, the only foreign exchange risk to which the Company is exposed is in respect of US dollar cash balances.

Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Company has no exposure in this area.

Of the total contingent consideration liability of 10.7 million, 4.9 million is considered to be payable in less than one year and is classified as a current liability.
The remaining 5.8 million is payable after a period greater than 12 months and is classified as a non-current liability.
The movement of contingent consideration during the year is shown below: Contingent consideration m At 30 June 2010 Liabilities arising on acquisition of subsidiary 28.1 Liabilities arising on the purchase of intangible assets 2.6 Net present value discount unwind 0.5 FX revaluation 0.8 At 30 June 2011 32.0 Net present value discount unwind 4.1 Fair value adjustment 16.8 Consideration that crystallised during the year 9.5 FX revaluation 0.9 At 30 June 2012 10.7 The contingent consideration payable following the acquisition of AshmoreEMM was adjusted at the end of the period, in line with accounting standards, to reflect its fair value.
Such a movement in fair value is driven principally by the levels of equities AuM managed by AshmoreEMM at 30 June 2012, compared with the levels forecast when the fair values of the contingent consideration liabilities were established on the completion date and retested at the end of the previous financial year.
The reduction in equities AuM principally through negative investment performance in line with the falls in global equity indices created a fall in the fair value of the contingent consideration.
The fall in the fair value of the Groups contingent consideration liabilities at 30 June 2012 resulted in a downward adjustment to the 30 June 2012 closing balance of 16.8 million 2011: nil.
The reduction of the discounted liability, reported within finance income, reflects a reduction in the Groups expected payments as a result of performance against contingent consideration milestones to date.
The potential undiscounted value of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under contingent consideration arrangements is between nil and a maximum of 65.3 million US$102.5 million 2011: nil and 86.7 million US$139.1 million.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated by reference to possible scenarios, weighted according to managements estimates of their probabilities and discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%.
The scenarios and assumptions are therefore reviewed on a regular basis to assess the potential sensitivities and impact on the Group.
The undiscounted value of the estimated payments was 12.5 million US$19.7 million 2011: 37.9 million US$ 60.9 million.
At maturity, contingent consideration will be settled using a combination of cash and new Ashmore ordinary shares at the prevailing market price.
Ashmore has the option to pay up to 3.0 million US$4.7 million 2011: 8.6 million US$13.8 million of the current estimate of the undiscounted contingent consideration amount that will ultimately become payable as equity.
The discount applied to the contingent consideration will unwind until the time when the final payment is made in May 2014.

The Group held 30.0% of the equity of an associate, Everbright Ashmore, as at 30 June 2012 2011: 30%.
The Groups share of net assets of the associates is currently below the carrying value of the investment reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
This is considered to be a temporary position which has arisen as the associates progress through an initial establishment phase.
No permanent impairment is believed to exist and as such the carrying value of the investment in associates has not been adjusted.
No profit has been recognised in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of its share of associates profit for the year as a result of the net asset position of the associates.
This treatment will continue to be applied until the Groups share of associates net assets returns to a level greater than the carrying value of the investment.
The Group has undrawn capital commitments of 18.4 million 2011: 21.6 million to investment funds managed by the associates.

28 Post-balance sheet events There were no post-balance sheet events that required adjustment of or disclosure in the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2012.
92 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2012 29 Accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based upon managements assessment of current and future events.
The principal estimates and judgements that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets annually for impairment.
The recoverable amount is determined based upon value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangibles on the Groups balance sheet at 30 June 2012 was 98.1 million 2011: 103.2 million.
Management considers that no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions applied would cause the carrying value of goodwill to materially exceed its recoverable value.
The Group assesses the recognition of performance fees to determine whether receipt of the fees is considered probable and the amount reliable.
The assessment is made using managements judgement of the circumstances relevant to each performance fee entitlement.
There were no outstanding performance fees receivable at 30 June 2012 2011: none.
The Group assesses the expected payments to be made under earnout arrangements to determine whether the estimates are reasonable based on current information.
The assessment is made using managements judgement of the likelihood of the conditions of the earnout being met taking into account the revenue earning capability of the underlying AuM.
The fair value of the contingent consideration is then calculated by reference to those estimates, weighted according to managements estimates of their probabilities and discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The combined liability of all earnout arrangements on the Groups balance sheet at 30 June 2012 was 10.7 million 2011: 32.0 million refer to note 23.
A number of assumptions are made in deriving the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration, including assumptions around future net management fee margins, net subscriptions, market performance and the average cost of capital.
While the Group believes that a set of prudent assumptions and estimates have been used that best reflect current market conditions, there remains a degree of uncertainty.
In the event that future results or revised assumptions contribute to an upward revision in the contingent consideration, the reduction recognised during the period, reported within finance income, could be partially or fully reversed.
It is possible that this document could or may contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as assumptions about future events.
These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.
Forward looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, will, may, should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.
