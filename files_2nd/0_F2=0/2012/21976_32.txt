Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value-added benets to the company.
In this context audit related assurance services are considered to pose a low threat to auditor independence and, therefore, the proportion of other non-audit services to total services is considered the most suitable measure to consider.
