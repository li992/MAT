June 2012: the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, Group Incentive Scheme GIS, Management Award Plan MAP and Group Short Term Incentive Plan GSTIP.
These awards take the form of Performance Shares, Deferred Shares and or Options, and Restricted Shares in either BHP Billiton Limited or BHP Billiton Plc.
Awards made are subject to performance hurdles LTIP and service conditions all plans.
Subject to the performance conditions and service conditions being met and the extent to which they are met, the awards will vest and the participant will become entitled to the appropriate number of ordinary shares or, if relevant, entitled to exercise options over the relevant number of ordinary shares.
Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue: however, there is discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation of BHP Billitons share capital.
A description of the plans follows: i GIS and GSTIP The GIS awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
The GSTIP is a replacement plan to the GIS for certain employees below the GMC and was first introduced during the year ended 30 June 2009.
Awards are split equally between a cash award being a percentage of base salary and a grant of Deferred Shares and or Options.
Deferred Shares and or Options are subject to a two-year vesting period before they can be exercised.
If, during that period, an individual resigns without the Remuneration Committees consent, or is dismissed for cause, their entitlement is forfeited.
