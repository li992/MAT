Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the amounts received from the sale remain subject to claw-back in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a good leaver.
In the case of Mr R A Allan, who was an expatriate and therefore not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares equal to the percentage tax rate that would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax were withheld.
These shares reverted to the Employee Benefit Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to claw-back if Mr Allan leaves Premier other than as a good leaver.
The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original deferral period, and are forfeitable if the director leaves other than as a good leaver.

Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 75 Details of outstanding LTIP awards LTIP Equity Pool Awards As at 31 December 2012, three Equity Pools were outstanding, as follows: Outstanding Equity Pool allocation % of Pool Starting market Cycle Performance period capitalisation S C Lockett R A Allan A R C Durrant N Hawkings A G Lodge 2010 01.01.10 31.12.12 1,342m 5.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 4.00% 2011 01.01.11 31.12.13 2,101m 6.00% 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% 2012 01.01.12 31.12.14 1,703m 6.00% 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% LTIP Performance Shares In each of 2010, 2011 and 2012, the executive directors were granted LTIP Performance Share Awards over shares with a value of 150 per cent of salary for the CEO and 125 per cent of salary for the other executive directors.
Shares vested on 19 January 2012, as disclosed in the 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The mid-market closing price on the date of vesting was 425.4p.
On 19 March 2013, the Committee determined that the 2010 Performance Share Awards will vest as soon as the company enters an open period for dealing in shares.
Details of the anticipated vesting schedule for the 2010 LTIP are given on page 67 of this report.
There are no performance criteria for the Deferred Shares.
Matching Awards granted are the maximum award possible under the Matching Award scheme, subject to performance criteria based on TSR against a comparator group of approximately 35 listed companies in the oil and gas sector.
Full vesting requires upper decile performance.
Outstanding awards under previous long-term incentive arrangements Asset and Equity Plan AEP The AEP preceded the LTIP as the companys main long-term incentive and expired in 2009.
The AEP had two elements: the Asset Pool and the Equity Pool.
The value of the Asset Pool was based on the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the value of the Equity Pool was based on the increase in equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no pool was created for growth in asset value or share price of less than 10 per cent per annum.
At growth of 10 per cent per annum, the pools were funded by one per cent of the growth.
The funding of the pools was capped at 2.5 per cent of the growth at growth of 20 per cent per annum.
The funding rate of the pools increased on a straight-line basis between these two points.
In addition, the vesting of awards was subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
The pools were allocated to eligible employees based on their pro-rata entitlement.
50 per cent of vested AEP awards were released in shares at the end of the performance period.
The remaining 50 per cent were deferred in shares over three years and are eligible for a Matching Award of up to 2.5 : 1, dependant on the TSR performance of the company relative to a comparator group of oil and gas companies i. e. on the same basis as LTIP Matching Awards.
Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the amounts received from the sale remain subject to claw-back in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a good leaver.
In the case of Mr R A Allan, who was an expatriate and therefore was not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares were withheld equal to the percentage tax rate that would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax.
These shares reverted to the Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to claw-back if Mr Allan leaves Premier other than as a good leaver.

By order of the Board I J Hinkley Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 20 March 2013 80 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Group financial statements Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year.
Under that law the directors are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law.
Under company law the directors must not approve the accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss of the company for that period.
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.
In preparing the group financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 Presentation of Financial Statements - requires that directors: properly select and apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance: and make an assessment of the companys and groups ability to continue as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the companys transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the companys website www.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors responsibility statement We confirm to the best of our knowledge: 1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable international financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole: and 2. the business review, which is incorporated into the Directors Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
By order of the Board S C Lockett A R C Durrant Chief Executive Finance Director 20 March 2013 20 March 2013 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 81 ACCOUNTING POLICIES General information Premier Oil plc is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered office is Premier Oil plc, 4th Floor, Saltire Court, 20 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2EN.
The principal activities of the company and its subsidiaries the group are oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea, Asia, the Falkland Islands, Middle East, Africa and Pakistan.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted, these have no material impact on the groups annual results: IAS 1 amended Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 12 amended Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the European Union : IFRS 1 amended Government Loans IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and IAS 27 Investment Entities amended IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 32 amended Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a Surface Mine Other than to expand certain disclosures within the financial statements, the directors do not expect that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group in future periods.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation of financial instruments and certain oil and gas properties at the transition date to IFRS.
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis.
Further information relating to the going concern assumption is provided in the Financial Review.
During the year, management changed the organisational structure of the group and the previous three regional setups were restructured to form seven business units: namely the Falkland Islands, Indonesia, Norway, Pakistan, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Rest of the World.
The segmental information for the comparative year contained within these financial statements has been re-presented to reflect this change.
82 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the group.
All significant inter-company transactions and balances between group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the group of an acquirees share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the groups interest in the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cashgenerating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 83 Interest in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Where a group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements directly, the groups shares of jointly controlled assets and any liabilities incurred jointly with other venturers are recognised in the financial statements of the relevant company and classified according to their nature.
Liabilities and expenses incurred directly in respect of interests in jointly controlled assets are accounted for on an accrual basis.
Income from the sale or use of the groups share of the output of jointly controlled assets, and its share of joint venture expenses, are recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transactions will flow to from the group and their amount can be measured reliably.
Joint venture arrangements which involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using proportionate consolidation the groups share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of jointly controlled entities are combined with the equivalent items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis.
Where the group transacts with its jointly controlled entities, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the groups interest in the joint venture.
Sales revenue and other income Sales of petroleum production are recognised when goods are delivered or the title has passed to the customer.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Oil and gas assets The company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation E&E costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
a Exploration and evaluation assets Under the successful efforts method of accounting, all licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs are initially capitalised in well, field or specific exploration cost centres as appropriate, pending determination.
Expenditure incurred during the various exploration and appraisal phases is then written off unless commercial reserves have been established or the determination process has not been completed.
Pre-licence costs Costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Exploration and evaluation costs Costs of E&E are initially capitalised as E&E assets.
Payments to acquire the legal right to explore, costs of technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploratory drilling and testing are capitalised as intangible E&E assets.
Tangible assets used in E&E activities such as the groups vehicles, drilling rigs, seismic equipment and other property, plant and equipment used by the companys exploration function are classified as property, plant and equipment.
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Such intangible costs include directly attributable overhead, including the depreciation of property, plant and equipment utilised in E&E activities, together with the cost of other materials consumed during the exploration and evaluation phases.
E&E costs are not amortised prior to the conclusion of appraisal activities.
Treatment of E&E assets at conclusion of appraisal activities Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence prospect are carried forward, until the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves has been determined subject to certain limitations including review for indications of impairment.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets, is then reclassified as development and production assets.
If, however, commercial reserves have not been found, the capitalised costs are charged to expense after conclusion of appraisal activities.
b Development and production assets Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy a above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
84 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Oil and gas assets continued b Development and production assets continued Depreciation of producing assets The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
c Impairment of development and production assets An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
d Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a business, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity.
Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
e Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas property.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively as an adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas property.
The unwinding of the discount is included as a finance cost.
Inventories Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Petroleum products and under and over lifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Tax The tax expense credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable recoverable and deferred tax movements during the year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill excess of fair value over cost or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 85 Tax continued The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The group reassesses its unrecognised deferred tax asset each year taking into account changes in oil and gas prices, the groups proven and probable reserve profile and forecast capital and operating expenditures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the functional currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of purchase and are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Royalties Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised as income.
Leasing Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
86 Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, i. e. when they are capable of commercial production.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types: fair value hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows: and hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
Currently the group only has cash flow hedge relationships.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship.
In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value.
The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income.
If the hedging relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the time it is recognised.
For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host contracts, including in particular price caps and floors within the groups oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not carried at fair value.
Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and short-term deposits, less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with an original maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
Premier Oil plc 2012 Annual Report and Financial Statements 87 Convertible bonds The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and is not re-measured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue, for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Details of the groups significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial statements and include: carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets note 8 : carrying value of property, plant and equipment note 9 : proved and probable reserves estimates note 9 : decommissioning costs note 16 : derivative financial instruments note 17 : tax and recognition of deferred tax assets note 18 : share-based payments note 19 : pensions note 23 : and fair value of subsidiaries acquired business combinations note 25.

Operating segments During the year, management changed the organisational structure of the group and the three previous regional setups were restructured to form seven business units: namely the Falkland Islands, Indonesia, Norway, Pakistan including Mauritania, the United Kingdom, Vietnam and Rest of the World.
The segmental information for 2011 has been re-presented to reflect this change.
Some of the business units currently do not generate revenue or has any material operating income.
The group is only engaged in one business of upstream oil and gas exploration and production, therefore all information is being presented for geographical segments.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 $ million $ million million million cents cents Basic 252.0 171.2 526.4 467.4 47.9 36.6 Contingently issuable shares 11.2 35.3 75.8 Diluted 263.2 171.2 561.7 543.2 46.9 31.5 The inclusion of the contingently issuable shares in the 2012 and 2011 calculations produces diluted earnings per share.

The amounts for intangible E&E assets represent costs incurred on active exploration projects.
These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.

Acquisitions in the current year mainly relate to the acquisition of EnCore note 25.
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
The 2012 impairment charge relates to assets on the Block A Aceh Production Sharing Contract in Indonesia due to application of a higher discount rate.
The impairment charge was calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves the value-in-use against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2013 and 2014, and US$85 bbl in real terms thereafter and were discounted using a discount rate of 12.5 per cent 2011: 10 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.

Property, plant and equipment continued Goodwill In January 2012, the group completed the acquisition of the entire issued share capital of EnCore.
This transaction has resulted in recognition of US$240.8 million goodwill which arose principally due to the difference between the fair value of the assets and the consideration transferred and the requirement to recognise deferred UK corporation tax liabilities for the difference between the assigned fair values and the tax bases of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Goodwill has been assigned to the UK business segment and more specifically to the Catcher field, which will be considered the cash generating unit for the purpose of any impairment testing of this goodwill.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations with the same key assumptions as noted for the impairment calculations above.
The discount rate in 2012 is 10 per cent.
The value in use forecast, which is formerly approved by management, takes into consideration cash flows which are expected to arise during the life of the Catcher field as a whole, currently expected to be around 2026.
This period exceeds five years but is believed to be appropriate as it is underpinned by estimates of commercial reserves provided by our in-house reservoir engineers using industry standard reservoir estimation techniques.
