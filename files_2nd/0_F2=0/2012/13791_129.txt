These include commodity, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
104 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 25 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued Commodity price risk The Groups policy is to consider oil and gas price hedging when and where it is economically attractive to lock-in prices at levels that protect the cash ow of the Salamander Group, its business plan and debt related coverage ratios.
All hedging transactions to date have been related directly to expected cash ows and no speculative transactions have been undertaken.
For 2012, the Groups oil production was all sold at prices relative to the spot market.
2012 production was hedged with swaps for 1,800 bopd with an average swap price of $103 per barrel and put options for 1,800 bopd at a price of $70 per barrel.
The hedges expired at the end of 2012.
During 2012, 35% of the Groups gas production its Indonesian gas production was sold at xed prices under long term contracts with the balance its Thai gas production sold at prices based on a formula related to spot medium sulphur fuel oil prices.
The Group held no hedges with respect to its gas production during 2012.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity on hedging mark to markets values to net income and equity to a 20% increase and a 20% decrease in this variable a positive sign indicates a positive effect on net income and vice versa : Increase decrease to mark-to-market value 2012 2011 Oil Oil $000s $000s 20% increase 16,908 13,722 20% decrease 12,849 15,394 Foreign exchange risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence, exposures to exchange rate uctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed through maintaining the majority of the Groups cash and cash equivalent balances in US Dollars, the Groups presentational currency and the functional currency of all its subsidiaries.
The Group also holds, from time to time, cash balances in UK Pounds Sterling and other currencies to meet short-term commitments in those currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2012 2011 2012 2011 $000s $000s $000s $000s US Dollar equivalent of: Canadian Dollar 229 UK Pounds Sterling 25,154 1,711 843 1,983 Singapore Dollar 646 528 253 154 Indonesian Rupiah 15,531 25,122 5,780 3,357 Thailand Baht 67,697 17,409 60,281 6,619 Vietnamese Dong 878 490 The UK Pound Sterling net asset balance at 31 December 2012 substantially represent cash and cash equivalents which are held by the Group to meet future UK Pound Sterling commitments.

The sensitivity analysis includes only foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year-end for a 20% change in the foreign currency rate.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit after tax where the US Dollar strengthens by 20% against the relevant currency.
For a 20% weakening of the US Dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit after tax and the balances below would be negative.

The Group is exposed to the following credit and counterparty risks.
In respect of cash and cash equivalents, the Groups principal financial asset, the credit risk is deemed limited because the majority of the cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks with AAor A credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies, as set out in note 19.
In respect of the Groups trade sales, the Group manages credit risk through dealing with, whenever possible, either international energy companies or state owned companies based in Thailand and Indonesia and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate.
The Group consistently monitors counterparty credit risk.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the year-end without taking account of any collateral obtained.
In addition, the Groups operations are typically structured via contractual joint venture arrangements.
As such the Group is reliant on joint venture partners to fund their capital or other funding obligations in relation to assets and operations which are not yet cash generative.
The Group closely monitors the risks and maintains a close dialogue with those counterparties considered to be highest risk in this regard.
106 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 25 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing facilities to meet its forecast short, medium and long term commitments.
The Group continually monitors its actual and forecast cash ows to ensure that there are adequate reserves and banking facilities to meet the maturing proles of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date the Group was required to pay at the Balance Sheet date.
The table includes both interest and principal cash ows.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its derivative financial liabilities: 2012 Less than 1-3 3 months 1 month months to 1 year Total $000s $000s $000s $000s Oil swap 4,634 4,634 Total 4,634 4,634 2011 Less than 1-3 3 months 1 month months to 1 year Total $000s $000s $000s $000s Oil collar 176 302 105 373 Interest rate swap 33 66 296 395 Total 209 368 191 768 107 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2012 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Financial instruments continued Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate movements through its lendings, bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are at rates xed to LIBOR.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the Groups exposure to an interest rate movement and is prepared assuming the amount of the net debt and interest rate swaps outstanding at the Balance Sheet date were outstanding for the whole year.
For net debt, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2012 would have increased or decreased by $0.9 million 2011: $1.1 million respectively.
This is principally attributable to the Group maintaining a lower cash and cash equivalents position as described in note 19.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value of financial instruments carried at amortised cost The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the Financial Statements approximate their fair values.
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: U The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices includes listed redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes.
U The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash ow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
U The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash ow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash ows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: U Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: U Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and U Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
