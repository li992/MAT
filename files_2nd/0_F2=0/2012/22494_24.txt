Close Brothers Group plc 65 Annual Report 2012 The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies a Reporting entity Close Brothers Group plc the company, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK, together with its subsidiaries collectively, the group, operates through three divisions: Banking, Securities and Asset Management, and is primarily located within the UK.
The company financial statements the company accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with Section 395 of the Companies Act 2006, the Large and Medium sized Companies and Groups Accounts and Reports Regulations 2008 and with all relevant UK accounting standards.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its company income statement and related notes.
b Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements the consolidated accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with all relevant IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, and interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee IFRIC, endorsed by the European Union EU.
At the balance sheet date the group adopted the following standards, amendments and interpretations which had become effective during the year.
The adoption of these did not have a material impact on the financial statements of the group.
IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets Requires additional disclosures in respect of risk exposures arising from transferred financial assets: IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures Amendments widen the scope of the definition of related parties: IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement: and IFRS Annual Improvements 2010.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued by the IASB and IFRIC with effective dates, subject to EU endorsement in some cases, which do not impact on these financial statements.
IAS 12 Income taxes Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012: IAS 1 Presentation of items in other comprehensive income Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013: IAS 19 Employee benefits Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013: IFRS 7 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013: IFRS 13 Fair value measurement Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013: IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IFRS 11 Joint arrangements Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IAS 27 Separate financial statements Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IAS 28 Investments in associates Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: IAS 32 Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014: and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
The impact on the groups financial statements of these future standards, amendments and interpretations is still under review, but the group does not currently expect any of these changes to have a material impact on the results or the net assets of the group.
c Basis of preparation The consolidated and company accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss, available for sale financial assets and all derivative financial instruments derivatives.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as disclosed in the Report of the Directors.
d Consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to directly or indirectly govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the group effectively obtains control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
Special purpose entities SPEs are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the group and its entity indicates control by the group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, with some limited exceptions, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The non-controlling interest is measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net assets acquired.
Acquisition related costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred, unless directly related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over net assets is capitalised as goodwill.
All intra group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated.
Close Brothers Group plc 66 Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Associates The consolidated accounts also incorporate the financial statements of entities that are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures but over which the company has significant influence associates, using the equity method of accounting.
This applies where the company and the group hold 20% or more of an entitys voting rights, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that no significant influence exists.
The groups share of an associates results is included in the consolidated income statement from the date it becomes an associate to the date it stops being so.
Under the equity method of accounting, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost.
This carrying amount subsequently increases for the groups share of any profit and decreases for the groups share of any losses or distributions received.
The carrying amount is also reviewed annually for impairment.
e Assets held for sale and discontinued operations Assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying amount is to be recovered principally through a sale transaction and a sale is considered highly probable.
They are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are shown separately on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
The results of discontinued operations are shown as a single amount on the face of the consolidated income statement comprising the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations and the post-tax gain or loss recognised either on measurement to fair value less costs to sell or on the disposal of the discontinued operation.
A discontinued operation is a cash generating unit CGUs or a group of CGUs that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
f Foreign currency translation For the company and those subsidiaries whose balance sheets are denominated in sterling which is the companys functional and presentation currency, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange over the year and exchange differences arising are taken to the consolidated income statement.
The balance sheets of subsidiaries and associates denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the closing rates.
The income statements for these subsidiaries and associates are translated at the average rates and exchange differences arising are taken to equity.
Such exchange differences are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the subsidiary or associate is disposed of.
g Revenue recognition Interest Interest on loans and advances made by the group, and fee income and expense and other direct costs relating to loan origination, restructuring or commitments are recognised in the consolidated income statement using the effective interest rate method.
The effective interest rate method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
Fees and commissions Where fees that have not been included within the effective interest rate method are earned on the execution of a significant act, such as fees arising from negotiating or arranging a transaction for a third party, they are recognised as revenue when that act has been completed.
Fees and corresponding expenses in respect of other services are recognised in the consolidated income statement as the right to consideration or payment accrues through performance of services.
In particular, upfront commissions paid in respect of managing, as opposed to originating, fund products are initially included within accruals and deferred income and then recognised as revenue as the services are provided.
To the extent that fees and commissions are recognised in advance of billing they are included as accrued income or expense.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Gains less losses arising from dealing in securities This includes the net gains arising from both buying and selling securities and from positions held in securities, including related interest income and dividends.
Close Brothers Group plc 67 Annual Report 2012 h Exceptional items Items of income and expense that are material by size and or nature and are non-recurring are classified as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of these items helps give an indication of the groups underlying performance.
i Financial assets and liabilities excluding derivatives Classification The group classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: i financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss: ii loans and receivables: iii held to maturity: and iv available for sale.
Financial liabilities are classified as either held at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
In 2012, interest accrued on certain financial instruments was reclassified from other assets and other liabilities to be shown together with the respective financial instruments.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets and liabilities held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset or liability is classified as trading if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term, which for the group relates to the securities trading businesses.
Financial assets and liabilities may be designated at fair value through profit or loss when: The designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities on a different basis: A group of financial assets and or liabilities is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis: or The assets or liabilities include embedded derivatives and such derivatives are required to be recognised separately.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken directly to the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and it is expected that substantially all of the initial investment will be recovered, other than because of credit deterioration.
Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method and recorded net of provisions for impairment losses.
Held to maturity Held to maturity assets are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Held to maturity financial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available for sale Available for sale assets are those non-derivative financial assets intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to liquidity requirements or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Available for sale financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value taken to a separate component of equity until the asset is sold, or is impaired, when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial assets or financial liabilities in active markets are based on current prices.
If the market for a financial asset or financial liability is not active, or they relate to unlisted securities, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
Derecognition Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the groups continuing involvement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished.
j Impairment of financial assets The group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as held to maturity, available for sale or loans and receivables is impaired.
A financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired and an impairment loss incurred if there is objective evidence that an event or events since initial recognition of the asset have adversely affected the amount or timing of future cash flows from the asset.
Close Brothers Group plc 68 Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on a financial asset or group of financial assets classified as loans and receivables or as held to maturity investments has been incurred, the group measures the amount of the loss as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets and the present value of estimated future cash flows from the asset or group of assets discounted at the effective interest rate of the instrument at initial recognition.
Impairment losses are assessed individually for financial assets that are individually significant and individually or collectively for assets that are not individually significant.
In making collective assessment of impairment, financial assets are grouped into portfolios on the basis of similar risk characteristics.
For loans and receivables, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the loans carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
As the loan amortises over its life, the impairment loss may amortise.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least at each reporting date.
If subsequently the amount of the loss decreases as a result of a new event, the relevant element of the outstanding impairment loss is reversed.
Interest on impaired financial assets is recognised at the original effective interest rate applied to the carrying amount as reduced by an allowance for impairment.
For loans that are not considered individually significant, the group adopts a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Loss rates are based on the discounted expected future cash flows and are regularly benchmarked against actual outcomes to ensure they remain appropriate.
Financial assets carried at fair value When a decline in the fair value of a financial asset classified as available for sale has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The loss is measured as the difference between the amortised cost of the financial asset and its current fair value.
Impairment losses on available for sale equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement, but those on available for sale debt instruments are reversed, if there is an increase in fair value that is objectively related to a subsequent event.
k Settlement accounts Settlement balance debtors and creditors are the amounts due to and from counterparties in respect of the groups market-making activities, and are carried at amortised cost.
The balances are short term in nature, do not earn interest and are recorded at the amount receivable or payable.
l Loans to and from money brokers against stock advanced Loans to money brokers against stock advanced is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities, and is carried at amortised cost.
Interest is paid on the stock borrowed and earned on the cash deposits held.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount receivable.
Loans from money brokers against stock collateral provided is recorded at the amount payable.
Interest is paid on the loans payable.
m Finance leases, operating leases and hire purchase contracts A finance lease is a lease or hire purchase contract that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Finance leases are recognised as loans at an amount equal to the gross investment in the lease discounted at its implicit interest rate.
Finance charges on finance leases are taken to income in proportion to the net funds invested.
Rental costs under operating leases and hire purchase contracts are charged to the consolidated income statement in equal annual amounts over the period of the leases.
n Sale and repurchase agreements and other secured lending and borrowings Securities may be sold subject to a commitment to repurchase them.
Such securities are retained on the consolidated balance sheet when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the group.
The transactions are treated as collateralised borrowing and the counterparty liability is included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
Similar secured borrowing transactions including securities lending transactions and collateralised short-term notes are treated and presented in the same way.
These secured financing transactions are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently valued at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
o Securitisation transactions Where the group securitises its own financial assets, this is achieved via the sale of these assets to an SPE, which in turn issues securities to investors.
All financial assets continue to be held on the groups consolidated balance sheet and debt securities in issue are recognised for the proceeds of the funding transaction.
p Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented on the consolidated balance sheet if, and only if, there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise an asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Close Brothers Group plc 69 Annual Report 2012 q Derivatives and hedge accounting In general, derivatives are used to minimise the impact of interest, currency rate and equity price changes to the groups financial instruments.
They are carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value which is obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, including recent market transactions and discounted cash flow models.
On acquisition, certain derivatives are designated as a hedge and the group formally documents the relationship between these derivatives and the hedged item.
The group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
If a hedge was deemed partially ineffective but continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the amount of the ineffectiveness, taking into account the timing of the expected cash flows where relevant, would be recorded in the consolidated income statement.
If the hedge is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective the group discontinues hedge accounting.
For fair value hedges, changes in the fair value are recognised in the consolidated income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item.
For cash flow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective proportion of the cash flow hedge is recognised initially directly in equity and recycled to the consolidated income statement in the period when the hedged item affects income.
Some contracts hybrid contracts contain both a derivative embedded derivative and a non-derivative host contract.
Where the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract itself is not carried at fair value through profit or loss, the embedded derivative is bifurcated and reported at fair value and gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
r Intangible assets Computer software and intangible assets on acquisition excluding goodwill are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation is calculated to write off their cost on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: Computer software 20% to 33% Intangible assets on acquisition 7% to 20% Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment and carried at cost less any accumulated impairment.
s Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated to write off their cost on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold property 2.5% Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10% to 33% Motor vehicles 25% Short leasehold property Over the length of the lease No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land, which is stated at cost.
t Share capital Share issue costs Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options including those issued on the acquisition of a business are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividends on ordinary shares Dividends on ordinary shares are recognised in equity in the period in which they are paid or, if earlier, approved by shareholders.
Treasury shares Where the company or any member of the group purchases the companys share capital, the consideration paid is deducted from shareholders equity as treasury shares until they are cancelled.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders equity.
Close Brothers Group plc 70 Annual Report 2012 Financial Statements The Notes 1.
Significant accounting policies continued u Employee benefits The group operates defined contribution pension schemes and a defined benefit pension scheme for eligible employees.
Under the defined contribution scheme the group pays fixed contributions into a fund separate from the groups assets.
Contributions are charged in the consolidated income statement when they become payable.
Under the defined benefit scheme eligible employees retirement receipts are defined by factors such as salary, length of service and age.
The liabilities of the groups defined benefit scheme, which was closed to new entrants in 1996 and to further accrual in 2012, are measured using the projected unit credit method and discounted at a rate that reflects the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds with a term that matches that of the liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the consolidated income statement over the members expected average remaining working lives.
The net deficit or surplus on the plan, comprising the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets and any unrecognised actuarial gains and losses, is carried on the consolidated balance sheet.
Under the revised IAS 19 Employee benefits which will be effective for our 2014 financial year, actuarial gains and losses remeasurements can no longer be deferred using the corridor method and must be recognised immediately in other comprehensive income.
v Share-based payments to employees The group operates five share-based award schemes, an annual discretionary performance arrangement Deferred Annual bonus DAB and four long-term incentive schemes Incentive Schemes : the Share Matching Plan SMP, the 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan which replaced the 2004 Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and the Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE scheme.
The costs of the DAB are based on the salary of the individual at the time the award is made.
The value of the share award at the grant date is charged to the groups consolidated income statement in the year to which the award relates.
The cost of the Incentive Schemes is based on the fair value of awards on the date of grant.
Fair values for market based performance conditions are determined using a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation pricing model for the SMP and LTIP and the Black-Scholes pricing model for the other schemes.
Both models take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
For non-market based performance conditions, vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually do, vest.
The fair value is expensed in the consolidated income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to the share-based awards reserve.
At the end of the vesting period, or upon exercise, lapse or forfeit if earlier, this credit is transferred to retained earnings.
Further information on the groups schemes is provided in note 32 and in the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
w Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are recognised in respect of present obligations arising from past events where it is probable that outflows of resources will be required to settle the obligations and they can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence depends on the outcome of uncertain future events or those present obligations where the outflows of resources are uncertain or cannot be measured reliably.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed unless they are remote.
x Taxes, including deferred taxes Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
To enable the tax charge to be based on the profit for the year, deferred tax is provided in full on temporary timing differences, at the rates of tax expected to apply when these differences crystallise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which temporary differences can be set.
All deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of IAS 12 Income taxes.
y Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprises cash and demand deposits with banks together with short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
z Segment reporting Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee which is considered the groups chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated on consolidation.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
Close Brothers Group plc 71 Annual Report 2012 2.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The reported results of the group are sensitive to the accounting policies, assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial statements.
UK company law and IFRS require the directors, in preparing the groups financial statements, to select suitable accounting policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
The groups estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed periodically.
The actual outcome may be materially different from that anticipated.
The judgements and assumptions involved in the groups accounting policies that are considered by the board to be the most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are as follows: a Impairment of loans and advances Allowances for loan impairment represent managements estimate of the losses incurred in the loan portfolios as at the balance sheet date.
Changes to the allowances for loan impairment are reported in the consolidated income statement as impairment losses on loans and advances.
Impairment provisions are made if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more subsequent events regarding a significant loan or a portfolio of loans and its impact can be reliably estimated.
Individual impairment losses are determined as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the loans original effective interest rate.
Impairment losses determined on a portfolio basis are calculated using a formulaic approach which allocates a loss rate dependent on the overdue period.
Estimating the amount and timing of future recoveries involves significant judgement, and considers the level of arrears as well as the assessment of matters such as future economic conditions and the value of collateral.
All impairment losses are reviewed at least annually.
b Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arms length transaction.
Some of the groups financial instruments are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value either reported within the consolidated income statement or within equity until the instrument is sold or becomes impaired.
An analysis of financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation hierarchy and particulars of valuation techniques used is included in note 34 and the accounting policy set out in note 1 i.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current prices.
If the market for a financial instrument, and for unlisted securities, is not active, the group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
c Effective interest rate The effective interest rate method applies a rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts relating to a financial instrument to its net carrying amount.
The estimated future cash flows take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument including transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts but not future credit losses.
Models are reviewed at least annually and are reviewed to assess expected lives of groups of assets based upon actual repayment profiles.
d Goodwill impairment The directors review goodwill for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in economic circumstances indicate that impairment may have taken place.
The recoverable amounts of relevant CGUs are based on value in use calculations using managements best estimate of future cash flows and performance, discounted at an appropriate rate which the directors estimate to be the return appropriate to the business.
e Share-based awards The cost of the groups long-term equity based incentive schemes are determined using commonly accepted valuation techniques.
Fair values for market-based performance conditions use models which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
For non-market based performance conditions, vesting conditions are not taken into account when measuring fair value, but are reflected by adjusting the number of shares in each award such that the amount recognised reflects the number that are expected to, and then actually vest.
Details of the above variables can be found in note 32.

The Group segment includes the groups central functions which comprise Group Executive, Finance, Investor Relations, Legal, Human Resources, Audit, Compliance, Corporate Development, Company Secretariat and Risk.
Group administrative expenses include staff costs, legal and professional fees and property costs attributable to the central functions which support and assist the development of the divisions.
Income within Group is typically immaterial and will include interest on cash balances at Group.
In the segmental reporting information which follows, Group consists of the central functions described above as well as various non-trading head office companies and consolidation adjustments, in order that the information presented reconciles to the overall group consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
Divisions charge market prices for services rendered to other parts of the group.
Funding charges between segments are determined by the Banking divisions Treasury operation taking into account commercial demands.
More than 90% of all the groups activities, revenue and assets are located in the UK.

The effective tax rate is reduced by inclusion of the share of profit of associate in the Consolidated Income Statement on an after tax basis, net lower tax rates applied to profit arising outside the UK and a non-taxable gain on the sale of a subsidiary and an associate.
These effects are mostly offset by increases in the effective tax rate from a reduction in the deferred tax asset due to a reduction in the standard UK corporation tax rate applicable for future periods and disallowable expenditure.

This acquisition is not regarded as material in the context of the groups financial statements and therefore the information that would be required for material acquisitions by IFRS 3 has not been disclosed.
2011 acquisitions On 10 September 2010 the group acquired 100% of Chartwell Group Limited, an IFA with 705million of client assets, for consideration of 16.9 million, including 2.3 million for the settlement of third party debt, recognising goodwill of 11.7 million and intangibles of 7.9 million.
On 18 February 2011 the group acquired 100% of Allenbridge Group plc, a London based execution only retail broker with 440million of client assets, for consideration of 5.4 million, including 0.8 million for the settlement of third party debt, recognising goodwill of 1.9 million and intangibles of 4.1 million.
On 31 May 2011 the group acquired 100% of Cavanagh Group plc, an IFA with 1.5 billion of client assets, for consideration of 27.1million, including 20.0 million in cash and 7.1 million equity, recognising goodwill of 12.4 million and intangibles of 20.2million.
The 7.1 million equity consideration was satisfied by the issue of 836,898 shares determined on the basis of the closing price of the company shares on 31 March 2011 of 845p per share.
None of these acquisitions is considered to be individually material.

The principal factors contributing to the recognition of goodwill on these acquisitions are synergies expected to arise from the integration with the group.
The primary reason for the acquisitions is to accelerate the groups strategy to create a leading UK wealth and asset management business.
The operating results of these acquisitions have been included from the dates acquired and, since acquisition, contributed 7.9million to operating income and 0.8 million, including 0.2 million of exceptional expenses, to operating profit before tax in the 2011 financial year.

Notional amounts of interest rate contracts totalling 2,515.3 million 2011: 1,470.7 million and exchange rate contracts totalling 39.3 million 2011: 43.0 million have a residual maturity of more than one year.
The notional amounts of equity and associated embedded derivatives with a residual maturity of more than one year total 300.8 million 2011: 454.8 million.
The group enters into derivative contracts with a number of financial institutions as a principal only to minimise the impact of interest and currency rate changes to its financial instruments.
Included in the derivatives above are the following IAS 39 cash flow hedges and IAS 39 fair value hedges: 2012 2011 Notional Notional value Assets Liabilities value Assets Liabilities million million million million million million Cash flow hedges Interest rate contracts 1,256.8 0.4 7.5 959.0 0.1 4.2 Fair value hedges Interest rate contracts 1,038.4 16.9 4.1 1,216.9 10.2 6.2 The cash flow hedges relate to exposure to future interest payments or receipts on recognised financial instruments and on forecast transactions for periods of up to seven 2011: six years: there was immaterial ineffectiveness.
The cash flow hedge amounts that were removed from equity and included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the years ended 31 July 2012 and 2011 were immaterial.
The amount recognised in equity for cash flow hedges during the year was a 2.3 million debit 2011: 0.6 million credit.
The fair value hedges hedge the interest rate risk in recognised financial instruments: the loss on the hedged items was 3.8 million 2011: loss of 1.1 million which was largely offset by the 3.7 million gain 2011: 1.3 million gain on the hedging instrument.

The increase of 3.3 million in 2012 primarily relates to the acquisition of Scott-Moncrieff Wealth Management Limited 2011: 32.2 million relates to the acquisitions of Chartwell Group Limited, Allenbridge Group plc and Cavanagh Group plc.
In the 2012 financial year, 4.9 million 2011: 2.1 million of the amortisation charge is included in amortisation of intangible assets on acquisition and 4.3 million 2011: 1.9 million of the amortisation charge is included in administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment tests for goodwill At 31 July 2012, goodwill has been allocated to ten individual CGUs, which are all at a lower level than the three operating divisions.
Seven of these CGUs are within the Banking division: two are within the Securities division and the remaining one is within the Asset Management division.
Details of the CGUs in which the goodwill carrying amount is significant in comparison with total goodwill are disclosed separately in the table below where applicable: Net book value of goodwill 31 July Foreign 31 July 2011 Acquisitions Disposals Impairment exchange 2012 million million million million million million Winterflood Securities 23.3 23.3 Close Asset Management 31.2 2.3 33.5 Close Asset Finance 7.4 7.4 Other 27.1 2.8 0.5 23.8 89.0 2.3 2.8 0.5 88.0 Close Brothers Group plc 87 Annual Report 2012 Goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at least annually by assessing the net recoverable value of the groups CGUs, which is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
A value in use calculation typically uses discounted cash flow projections based on the most recent budgets and three year plans to determine the recoverable amount of each CGU.
For cash flows beyond the groups three year planning horizon, a terminal value was calculated using an annual growth rate of 2%, except where a lower rate is considered more appropriate when considering the future prospects and performance of the individual CGU.
The resulting cash flows were then discounted using the groups post-tax estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.0% 11.6% pre-tax as a base and adjusted for each division.
A pre-tax rate of 14.0% was used for Banking, 13.2% for Asset Management and 11.2% for the Securities division, respectively.
The cash flows used in these value in use calculations are sensitive to the impact of changes in the assumptions for profit before tax, discount rates, and long-term growth rates.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions which have been used would not lead the carrying value of any CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
As a result of the transformation undertaken within the Asset Management division, an impairment charge of 3.7 million was recognised in the Asset Management division for the year ended 31 July 2011.

Capital management The groups policy is to be well capitalised and its approach to capital management is driven by strategic and organisational requirements, while also taking into account the regulatory and commercial environments in which it operates.
The FSA supervises the group on a consolidated basis and receives information on the capital adequacy of, and sets capital requirements for, the group as a whole.
In addition, a number of subsidiaries are directly regulated by the FSA.
The aim of the capital adequacy regime is to promote safety and soundness in the financial system.
It is structured around three pillars: Pillar 1 on minimum capital requirements: Pillar 2 on the supervisory review process: and Pillar 3 on market discipline.
The groups Pillar 1 information is presented in the following table.
Under Pillar 2, the group completes an annual self assessment of risks known as the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP.
The ICAAP is reviewed by the FSA which culminates in the FSA setting Individual Capital Guidance on the level of capital the group and its regulated subsidiaries are required to hold.
Pillar 3 requires firms to publish a set of disclosures which allow market participants to assess information on that firms capital, risk exposures and risk assessment process.
The groups Pillar 3 disclosures can be found on the groups website www.
The group maintains a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to ensure the group meets the Pillar 1 capital requirements at all times.
As a result, the group maintains capital adequacy ratios comfortably above minimum regulatory requirements.
Accordingly, the groups individual regulated entities and the group as a whole complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject for the years ended 31 July 2012 and 2011.
A full analysis of the composition of regulatory capital and Pillar 1 risk weighted assets is shown in the following table, including a reconciliation between equity and core tier 1 capital after deductions.
Close Brothers Group plc 93 Annual Report 2012 The groups capital ratios remained strong with a core tier 1 capital ratio of 12.8% 31 July 2011: 13.1% and a total capital ratio of 14.5% 31 July 2011: 14.9%.
The decrease in the capital ratios was principally due to an increase in risk weighted assets as a result of growth in the loan book which was partly offset by a reduction in debt securities and notional risk weighted assets for operational risk reflecting lower trading activity in Securities.
Regulatory capital core tier 1 capital and total capital increased during the year due to an increase in retained earnings and other reserves.
The composition of capital remained stable with 88.3% 31 July 2011: 88.0% of the total capital consisting of core tier 1 capital.

Contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS A principal subsidiary of the group, CBL, by virtue of being a FSA regulated deposit taker, contributes to the FSCS which provides compensation to customers of financial institutions in the event that an institution is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises levies on UK licensed deposit taking institutions to meet such claims based on their share of UK deposits on 31 December of the year preceding the scheme year which runs from 1April to 31March.
The group has accrued 0.4 million 2011: 0.9 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS, in respect of the levy years to 31 March 2012.
Compensation has previously been paid out by the FSCS funded by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
In April 2012, the FSCS agreed revised terms on the loan facilities including a 70bps increase in the interest rate payable to 12 month LIBOR plus 100 basis points.
The facilities are expected to be paid wholly from recoveries from the failed deposit takers, except for an estimated shortfall of 0.8billion which the FSCS has announced it intends to collect in three equal instalments of approximately 270 million beginning in 2013 2014, in addition to the ongoing interest charges on the outstanding loans.
The ultimate FSCS levy to the industry as a result of the collapse of certain financial services firms cannot currently be determined as it is dependent on various uncertain factors including the potential recoveries of assets by the FSCS.
The groups share of the ultimate FSCS levy will also depend on the level of protected deposits and the population of FSCS members at the time.
Other The company has given guarantees in respect of subsidiaries bank facilities of 83.1 million 2011: 83.1 million and subsidiaries property leases of 5.0 million 2011: 8.2 million.

In addition, the group agreed to contribute an additional 8.4 million towards the current funding deficit, with 2.8 million paid in each of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 financial years.
A valuation at 31 July 2012 will be completed by 31 October 2013 from which future contributions will be determined.
The valuation was based upon the following main actuarial assumptions: 2012 2011 % % Inflation rate Retail Price Index 2.7 3.6 1 Rate of increase in salaries 4.8 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.8 5.5 Expected return on the schemes assets: Equities 6.9 7.9 Bonds 2.7 4.2 Cash 1.9 3.6 2 Mortality assumptions : Existing pensioners from age 65, life expectancy years : Men 23.8 23.7 Women 25.4 25.2 Non-retired members currently aged 50, life expectancy from age 65 years : Men 26.0 25.8 Women 27.6 27.4 1 The scheme closed to future accruals in 2012.
2 Based on standard tables SAPS S1 Light produced by the CMI Bureau of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, together with projected future improvements in line with the Medium Cohort subject to a 1.5% per annum underpin.
In the prior year it was identified that the normal retirement age of scheme members was not effectively equalised at 65.
As a result, the scheme liabilities were remeasured to a normal retirement age of 60 resulting in an increase of 5.8 million and an actuarial loss for the year to 31 July 2011.
Expected return on equities are determined by reference to Towers Watsons Global Investment Committees ten year outlook as at 30 June 2012 as adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.
Expected return on fixed interest gilts of 2.0% is based on the 15 year FTSE fixed interest gilt yield at 31 July 2012.
Expected return on index-linked gilts of 2.6% is based on the over five year FTSE index-linked gilts yield adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.
The expected return on corporate bonds of 3.4% is based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index yields of 3.9% reduced by 0.5% for default risk.
Expected return on cash is determined by reference to Towers Watsons Global Investment Committees ten year outlook at 30 June 2012 as adjusted for the inflation assumption disclosed above.

Financial risk management As a diversified group of financial services businesses, financial instruments are central to the groups activities.
The risk associated with financial instruments represents a significant component of those faced by the group and is analysed in more detail below.
The groups financial risk management objectives are summarised within Risk and Control Framework in Corporate Governance on page 37.
Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1. a Classification The tables below analyse the groups assets and liabilities in accordance with the categories of financial instruments in IAS 39.

Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: Valuation hierarchy Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities where prices are readily available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency to provide ongoing pricing information.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly derived from prices: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Investments classified as Level 1 predominantly comprise UK government securities and listed equity shares.
Investments classified as Level 2 predominantly comprise investment grade corporate bonds, less liquid listed equities and over the counter derivatives.
Investments classified as Level 3 predominantly comprise investments in private equity funds and unlisted equity shares.
Level 3 equity shares represent investments made in unlisted property funds, private equity limited partnership interests and an entity providing settlement and related services.
For fund investments, the most recent net asset value as calculated and reported by the fund manager is the basis of the valuations.
Private equity limited partnership interests are valued using semi-annual valuations of the individual portfolio holdings held by each partnership, in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines.
Under these guidelines, new investments are generally valued at cost for the first year.
Thereafter valuations are typically based on a multiple of the sustainable earnings before interest and tax of each holding, such multiple derived by reference to a comparable quoted company, sector or recent transaction, and discounted to account for differences in size, product mix, growth prospects, level of gearing and marketability.
In addition, the group applies a discount to these valuations to reflect the relative infrequency of the private equity valuations, and the illiquid nature of the portfolio.
The discount is based on an average of the discounts to net asset value observed in a population of comparable quoted private equity funds.

Financial risk management continued The group believes that there is no reasonably possible change to the inputs used in the valuation of these positions which would have a material effect on the groups income statement.

The gains recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement relating to instruments held at the year end amounted to 0.3million 2011: loss of 0.5 million.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a reduction in earnings and or value, as a result of the failure of a counterparty or associated party with whom the group has contracted to meet its obligations in a timely manner and arises mainly from the lending and treasury activities of the Banking division.
The groups lending activities are generally short-term in nature with low average loan size.
In addition the group applies consistent and prudent lending criteria mitigating credit risk.
The credit quality of counterparties with whom the group deposits or whose debt securities are held is monitored within approved limits.
Loans and advances are spread across asset classes, short-term and with a low average loan size in order to control concentration risk in the loan book and associated collateral.
The Banking division monitors the credit quality of the counterparties with whom the group places deposits, enters into derivative contracts or whose debt securities are held against established limits.
Whilst these amounts may be material, the counterparties are all regulated institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies and fall within the large exposure limits set by the regulatory requirements.
Credit risk in the Securities division is limited as the businesses in that division trade in the cash markets with regulated counterparties on a delivery versus payment basis such that any credit exposure is limited to price movements in the underlying securities.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place.
Credit and counterparty risk, and the measures taken to mitigate or manage these risks, are disclosed within the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section of the Business Review on pages 24 to 27.

Financial risk management continued Maximum exposure to credit risk The table below presents the groups maximum exposure to credit risk, before taking account of any collateral and credit risk mitigation, arising from its on balance sheet and off balance sheet financial instruments at 31 July 2012.
For off balance sheet instruments, the maximum exposure to credit risk represents the contractual nominal amounts.

However, given increased market and regulatory focus on such exposures, particularly in relation to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, the group considers it appropriate to provide the following disclosure.
The group has no direct exposures to debt issued by sovereigns or financial institutions in any of the countries listed above.
In the prior year it had exposure of 94.6 million through a holding of FRNs issued by Irish banks.
These FRNs matured during the year to 31July 2012 and were repaid in full.
The group has loans and advances to customers in Ireland and Spain.
These relate to loans in the groups Retail and Commercial businesses and are issued with the same approach to lending as applied within the UK.
2012 2011 million million Loans and advances to customers Ireland 103.9 75.7 Spain 2.2 3.4 106.1 79.1 The group has no other material exposure to these economies.
Assets pledged and received as collateral The group pledges assets for repurchase agreements and securities borrowing agreements which are generally conducted under terms that are usual and customary to standard securitised borrowing contracts.
The group has securitised without recourse and restrictions 1,038.2 million 31 July 2011: 495.0 million of its insurance premium and motor loan receivables in return for debt securities in issue of 835.0 million 31 July 2011: 350.0 million.
As the group has retained exposure to substantially all the credit risk and rewards of the residual benefit of the underlying assets it continues to recognise these assets in loans and advances to customers in its consolidated balance sheet.
The group has entered into a repurchase agreement whereby FRNs to the value of 98.2 million 31 July 2011: 249.5 million have been lent in exchange for cash of 78.8 million 31 July 2011: 205.1 million which has been included within loans and overdrafts from banks.
These FRNs remain on the groups consolidated balance sheet as the group retains the risks and rewards of ownership.
Close Brothers Group plc 107 Annual Report 2012 The vast majority of loans and advances to customers are secured against specific assets.
The security will correspond to the type of lending as detailed in the segmental loan book analysis on page 19 of the Business Review.
Consistent and prudent lending criteria is applied across the whole loan book with emphasis on the quality of the security provided.
Loans to money brokers against stock advanced is the cash collateral provided to these institutions for stock borrowing by the groups market-making activities.
The stock borrowing to which the cash deposits relate is short term in nature and is recorded at the amount payable.
Financial assets: Loans and advances to customers Credit risk management and monitoring Within the Banking division the overall credit risk appetite is set by the CBL board.
The monitoring of credit policy is the responsibility of the Banking divisions risk and compliance committees.
All large loans are subject to approval by the Banking divisions Credit Committees.
Retail, Commercial and Property each use credit underwriting and monitoring measures appropriate to the diverse and specialised nature of their lending.
Retail is typically high volume lending with a small average loan size.
Credit issues are identified early via predominantly automated tracking processes.
Remedial actions are implemented promptly to restore customers to a performing status or recovery methods are applied to minimise potential loss.
Commercial is a combination of several niche lending businesses with a diverse mix of loans in terms of assets financed and average loan size.
Credit quality is assessed either on an individual loan by loan basis or a collective portfolio basis.
This approach allows remedial action to be implemented at the appropriate time to minimise potential loss.
Property is a portfolio of higher value, low volume lending.
Loans are continually monitored to determine whether they are performing satisfactorily.
Performing loans with elevated levels of credit risk may be placed on watch lists depending on the perceived severity of the credit risk.
Credit risk reporting Loans and advances to customers within the Banking division, as disclosed in note 13, are analysed between the following categories for credit risk reporting: i Neither past due nor impaired These loans and advances to customers reflect the application of consistent and conservative lending criteria on inception and the quality and level of security held.
The contractual repayments are monitored to ensure that classification as neither past due nor impaired remains appropriate.
It also demonstrates the short term nature of the lending, with 2.2 billion 2011: 1.8 billion having a contractual maturity of less than 12 months.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are neither past due nor impaired.

Financial risk management continued ii Past due but not impaired Loans and advances to customers are classified as past due but not impaired when the customer has failed to make a payment when contractually due but there is no evidence of impairment.
This includes loans which are individually assessed for impairment but where the value of security is sufficient to meet the required repayments.
This also includes loans to customers which are past due for technical reasons such as delays in payment processing or rescheduling of payment terms.
The following table shows the ageing of loans and advances to customers split by credit assessment method which are past due but for which no impairment provision has been raised.
2012 2011 Loans and advances to customers Loans and advances to customers Individually Collectively Individually Collectively assessed assessed Total assessed assessed Total million million million million million million Within one month 72.9 20.6 93.5 38.3 17.1 55.4 Between one and three months 35.4 4.3 39.7 57.5 3.2 60.7 Between three months and one year 39.7 15.4 55.1 36.2 10.8 47.0 Over one year 16.3 33.7 50.0 12.4 25.1 37.5 164.3 74.0 238.3 144.4 56.2 200.6 iii Impaired The factors considered in determining whether assets are impaired are outlined in the accounting policies in note 1 j.
Impaired loans and advances to customers are analysed according to whether the impairment provisions are individually or collectively assessed.
Individually assessed provisions are determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the financial condition of the customer and an estimate of potential recovery from the realisation of security.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Property business and by the invoice finance business within Commercial.
Collectively assessed provisions are considered on a portfolio basis, to reflect the homogeneous nature of the assets.
A percentage of the portfolio is impaired by evaluating the ageing of missed payments combined with the historical recovery rates for that particular portfolio.
Typically this methodology is applied by the Retail businesses and the asset finance business within Commercial.
The gross impaired loans are quoted without taking account of any collateral or security held, which could reduce the potential loss.
The application of conservative loan to value ratios on inception and the emphasis on the quality of the security provided, is reflected in the low provision to gross impaired balance ratio coverage ratio of 30% 2011: 30%.
The following table shows gross impaired loans and advances to customers and the provision thereon split by assessment method.

Whilst collateral is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with credit policy, this varies according to the type of lending, collateral involved and the status of the loan.
It is therefore impracticable to estimate and aggregate current fair values for collateral.
Financial assets: Settlement balances Credit risk management and monitoring The credit risk presented by settlement balances in the Securities division is limited as such balances represent delivery versus payment transactions where delivery of securities occurs simultaneously with payment.
The credit risk is therefore limited to the change in market price of a security between trade date and settlement date and not the absolute value of the trade.
The Securities businesses are market-makers and they trade on a principal only basis.
The Securities businesses trade only with regulated counterparties including stockbrokers, wealth managers, institutions and hedge funds who are either approved by the FSA or equivalent regulator in the respective country.
Close Brothers Group plc 109 Annual Report 2012 Credit risk reporting Settlement balances are classified as neither past due nor impaired when the respective trades have not yet reached their settlement date.
Settlement balances are classified as past due but not impaired when trades fail to be settled on their contractual settlement date.
The credit risk presented by settlement balances which are past due is mitigated by the delivery versus payment mechanism, as well as by the Securities businesses trading only with regulated counterparties.
Counterparty exposure and settlement failure monitoring controls are in place as part of an overall risk management framework and settlement balances past due are actively managed.

Interest rate risk The groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to the returns from its capital and reserves which, as a matter of policy, are not hedged.
The groups policy is to match fixed and variable interest rate liabilities and assets utilising interest rate swaps where necessary to secure the margin on its loans and advances to customers.
These interest rate swaps are disclosed in note 16.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rate scenarios, including parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At 31 July 2012 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups annual net interest income by the following amounts: 2012 2011 million million 1.0% increase 2011: 1.0% increase 2.5 2.7 0.5% decrease 2011: 0.5% decrease 1.3 1.4 At 31 July 2012 changes in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2012 2011 million million 1.0% increase 2011: 1.0% increase 8.6 8.0 0.5% decrease 2011: 0.5% decrease 4.3 4.0 Foreign currency risk The group has a number of currency investments in subsidiaries and an associate and has chosen not to hedge these exposures.
These investments are predominantly in US dollars and euros.
Foreign exchange differences which arise from the translation of these operations are recognised directly in equity.
At 31 July 2012 changes in exchange rates would decrease the groups equity by the following amounts: 2012 2011 million million 20% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar 2011: 20% strengthening 3.7 6.6 20% strengthening of sterling against the euro 2011: 20% strengthening 4.4 10.7 The group has additional material currency assets and liabilities primarily as a result of treasury operations in the Banking division.
These assets and liabilities are matched by currency, using exchange rate derivative contracts where necessary.
Details of these contracts are disclosed in note 16.
Other potential group exposures arise from share trading settled in foreign currency in the Securities division, and small foreign currency equity investments.
The group has policies and processes in place to manage foreign currency risk, and as such the impact of any reasonably expected exchange rate fluctuations would not be material.

The following table shows the groups trading book exposure to market price risk.

The average exposure has been calculated on a daily basis.
The highest and lowest exposures occurred on different dates and therefore a net position of these exposures does not reflect a spread of the trading book.
Based upon the trading book exposure given above, a hypothetical fall of 10% in market prices would result in a 1.5 million decrease 2011: 2.4 million decrease in the groups income and net assets on the equity trading book and a 0.3 million increase 2011: 1.2million decrease on the debt securities trading book.
However, the groups trading activity is mainly market-making where positions are managed throughout the day on a continuous basis.
Accordingly the sensitivity referred to above is purely hypothetical.
Non-trading financial instruments Net gains and losses on non-trading financial instruments are disclosed in notes 14 and 15.
Close Brothers Group plc 111 Annual Report 2012 e Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that liabilities cannot be met when they fall due or can only be met at an uneconomic price and arises mainly in the Banking division.
The group has a prudent liquidity position with total available funding at 31 July 2012 of 5.9 billion 2011: 5.4 billion.
This funding is significantly in excess of its loans and advances to customers at 31 July 2012 of 4.1 billion 2011: 3.4 billion.
The group has a large portfolio of high quality liquid assets including cash placed on deposit with the Bank of England and gilts.
The group measures liquidity risk with a variety of measures including regular stress testing and cash flow monitoring, and reporting to both the group and divisional boards.
The following table analyses the contractual maturities of the groups on-balance sheet financial liabilities on an undiscounted cash flow basis.
