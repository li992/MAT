UK tax rate The UK Budget in March 2012 announced a change in the main rate of UK corporation tax.
The new rate of 24.0% was substantively enacted on 26 March 2012 and applied from 1 April 2012.
Underwriting profits Underwriting profits and losses are recognised in the income statement on an annual accounting basis, recognising the results in the period in which they are earned.
UK corporation tax on Syndicate 2001s underwriting result is charged in the period in which the underwriting profits are actually paid by the Syndicate to the corporate member subsidiary.
This creates a deferred tax position.
Deferred tax is provided on the underwriting result with reference to the forecast ultimate result of each of the years of account.
Where this is a taxable loss, deferred tax is only provided on the movement on that year of account to the extent that forecasts show that the taxable loss will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset before netting off has been recognised on the underwriting result for this accounting period of 7.2 million 2011: 10.5 million liability.
The Group is subject to US tax on US underwriting profits.
No provision has been made in respect of such tax arising in 2012 2011: nil as any net provision is likely to be immaterial.
Controlled Foreign Companies legislation The Groups reinsurance subsidiary, Amlin Bermuda Ltd, was re-domiciled from Bermuda to Switzerland during 2010 and renamed Amlin AG.
The company has since operated in Switzerland as Amlin Re Europe, with the Bermudian business operating as a branch.
The Groups tax provision for 2012 has been prepared on the basis that Amlin AG is non-UK resident for UK corporation tax purposes and is exempt from the UK controlled foreign company regime.
The corporation tax rate for profits earned by the Bermudian branch of Amlin AG is currently nil% 2011: nil%.
The combined rate of Swiss cantonal and federal taxes, applicable to profits arising from the Swiss operation only, is 21.2% 2011: 21.2%.
Deferred tax rate Deferred tax has been provided for at the local tax rate in force when the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The UK tax rate applied for deferred tax purposes 23.0% was enacted in July 2012.
Further reductions in the UK corporation tax rate have been announced, which will reduce the corporation tax rate to 21.0%.
These subsequent reductions have not yet been enacted or substantively enacted and therefore the rate at which deferred tax is provided remains 23.0% in accordance with IAS 12.
The estimated impact of the reduction from 23.0% to 21.0% will be a reduction in the net deferred tax liability of 0.3 million 2011: 4.2 million.
