The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of properties, financial instruments and pension assets.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Report of the directors on page 118.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the financial statements.
The directors believe that the judgements made in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
Critical accounting judgements include the adoption of the external portfolio valuation without adjustment, the recognition of purchases and disposal of assets, the adoption of a single reporting segment and the level of control the Group has in respect of its joint ventures.
The accounting policies for these areas of judgement are set out below.
During 2012, the following accounting standards and guidance were adopted by the Group, the pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only: IAS 24 revised Nov 2009 Related Party Disclosures IFRS 1 Amendments Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters IFRIC 14 amended Nov 2009 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The improvements to IFRSs May 2010 At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU : IFRS 7 amended Dec 2011 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities IFRS 7 amended Oct 2010 Disclosures Transfers of Assets IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 1 amended June 2011 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS 19 revised June 2011 Employee Benets IAS 27 revised May 2011 Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised May 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings for the year ended 31 March 2012.
Subsidiary undertakings are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group directs the financial and operating policies of an entity to benefit from its activities.
Rental income This comprises rental income and premiums on lease surrenders on investment properties for the year, exclusive of service charges receivable.
Tenant leases The directors have considered the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and in their judgement have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Annual review Financials Governance 69 1 Accounting policies continued Lease incentives Lease incentives including rent-free periods and payments to tenants, are allocated to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term or on another systematic basis, if applicable.
The value of resulting accrued rental income is included within the respective property.
Other property expenses Irrecoverable running costs directly attributable to specic properties within the Groups portfolio are charged to the income statement as other property expenses.
Costs incurred in the improvement of the portfolio which, in the opinion of the directors, are not of a capital nature are written off to the income statement as incurred.
Administration expenses Costs not directly attributable to individual properties are treated as administration expenses.
Share-based payment The cost of granting share-based payments to employees and directors is recognised within administration expenses in the income statement.
The Group has used the Stochastic model to value the grants which is dependent upon factors including the share price, expected volatility and vesting period and the resulting fair value is amortised through the income statement over the vesting period.
The charge is reversed if it is likely that any non-market based criteria will not be met.
Investment property Investment properties and investment properties under development are professionally valued quarterly, on a fair value basis, by qualied external valuers.
The valuation is based on a number of assumptions including discount rates, estimates of future capital expenditure and rental income.
Any surpluses or deficits on revaluation arising are taken to the income statement.
All directly attributable costs of bringing a property to a condition suitable for letting, including third party obligations and costs incurred prior to gaining planning permission, are capitalised into the cost of the property.
Purchases and disposals of properties are recognised where contracts have been exchanged during the accounting period and, in the directors judgement, the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the property have been transferred.
Depreciation No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties.
Depreciation is provided on plant and equipment, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Fixtures and ttings over three to five years.
Leasehold improvements over the term of the lease.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method where, in the directors judgement, the Group has joint control of the entity.
The Groups level of control in its joint ventures is driven both by the individual agreements which set out how control is shared by the partners and how that control is exercised in practice.
The Group balance sheet contains the Groups share of the net assets of its joint ventures.
Balances with partners owed to or from the Group by joint ventures are included within investments.
The Groups share of joint venture profits and losses are included in the Group income statement in a single line.
All of the Groups joint ventures adopt the accounting policies of the Group for inclusion in the Group financial statements.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be utilised.
Pension benets The Group contributes to a dened benefit pension plan which is funded with assets held separately from those of the Group.
The full value of the net assets or liabilities of the pension fund is brought on to the balance sheet at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are taken to reserves: all other movements are taken to the income statement.
Capitalisation of interest Interest associated with direct expenditure on investment properties under development is capitalised.
Direct expenditure includes the purchase cost of a site if it has been purchased with the specic intention to redevelop, but does not include the original book cost of a site previously held as an investment property.
Interest is capitalised from the start of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The rate used is the Groups weighted average cost of borrowings or, if appropriate, the rate on specic associated borrowings.
Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2012 70 70 PUFT GPSNJOH QBSU PG UIF SPVQ fiOBODJBM TUBUFNFOUT 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments: i Derivatives The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency uctuations and interest rate risks.
The Groups derivatives are measured at fair value in the balance sheet.
To the extent that a derivative is a designated hedge and provides an effective cash ow hedge against the Groups underlying exposure the movements in the fair value of the hedge are taken to equity.
To the extent that the derivative is a designated hedge or does not effectively hedge the underlying exposure the movement in the fair value of the hedge is taken to the income statement.
ii Borrowings The Groups borrowings in the form of its debentures, private placement notes and bank loans are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount or premium on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently borrowings are held at amortised cost, with any discounts, premiums and attributable costs charged to the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash and are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value.
iv Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Head leases The present value of future ground rents is added to the carrying value of a leasehold investment property and to long-term liabilities.
On payment of a ground rent virtually all of the cost is charged to the income statement, principally as interest payable, and the balance reduces the liability: an equal reduction to the assets valuation is charged to the income statement.
Segmental analysis All of the Groups revenue is generated from investment properties located in central London.
The properties are managed as a single portfolio by an asset management team whose responsibilities are not segregated by location or type, but are managed on an asset by asset basis.
The majority of the Groups assets are mixed use, therefore the ofce and retail space is managed together.
Within the investment property portfolio the Group has a number of properties under development.
The directors view the Groups development activities as an integral part of the life cycle of each of its assets rather than a separate business or division.
The nature of developing property means that whilst a property is under development it generates no revenue and has no operating results.
Once a development has completed it returns to the investment property portfolio.
The directors have considered the nature of the business, how the business is managed and how they review performance and, in their judgement, the Group has only one reportable segment.
The components of the valuation, as provided by CBRE, are set out on page 24 of this Report.

On the termination of these derivatives, fair value movements previously charged to reserves are required to be recycled through the income statement where the facilities to which they relate are not expected to be utilised.
During the year, the Group recycled 1.5 million 2011: 3.1 million of losses from the hedging reserve to the income statement.

The Groups net deferred tax at 31 March 2012 was nil 2011: nil.
This consists of a deferred tax liability of 0.1 million 2011: nil arising from the Groups pension surplus and a deferred tax asset of 0.1 million 2011: nil in respect of capital allowances and other short-term differences.
Annual review Financials Governance 73 73 8 Tax continued A deferred tax asset of 8.2 million, mainly relating to tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2012 and deferred tax arising in respect of contingent share awards, was not recognised because it is uncertain whether future taxable profits will arise against which these losses can be offset.
As a REIT, the Group is largely exempt from corporation tax in respect of its rental profits and chargeable gains relating to its property rental business.
The Group is otherwise subject to corporation tax.
The Group estimates that as the majority of its future profits will not be subject to corporation tax, it will have a very low tax charge over the coming years.
In order to ensure that the Group is able to both retain its status as a REIT and to avoid financial charges being imposed, a number of tests including a minimum distribution test must be met by both Great Portland Estates plc and by the Group as a whole on an ongoing basis.
These conditions are detailed in the Corporation Tax Act 2010.

P. E. Marcol House Limited its share capital is classied as a liability under IAS 39.
As a result, an element of the Groups return on its investment in the joint venture is shown as a return on this liability.
This results in a revaluation deficit on the Groups equity investment and a revaluation surplus on the Groups balances with partners.

P. E. Marcol House Limited is a joint venture with Eurohypo.
Eurohypo has a profit share arrangement dependent on the success of the two development schemes held by G. P. E. Marcol House Limited.
Eurohypo is able to exert inuence over the development strategy for the buildings and because these are the only assets held by the entity this inuence extends over the whole of the entitys operations.
As a result of this arrangement, GPE and Eurohypo are considered to have joint control over the business of the entity despite GPE having a 100% equity interest.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 31, G. P. E. Marcol House Limited has been treated as a joint venture.

Post balance sheet event GPE has agreed to issue US dollar notes through private placement.
The notes were priced on 15 March 2012 with the respective coupons set as follows: $160.0 million, seven-year note at 4.20%: and $40.0 million, ten-year note at 4.82%.
The related legal documentation was signed on 9 May 2012 and the funds will be drawn on 30 May 2012.
As the Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and all of its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, it entered into a cross currency swap in order to ensure the US dollar liability stream generated by the notes was fully hedged into sterling for the life of the transaction.
Through entering into the cross currency swap the Group has created a synthetic sterling xed rate liability exposure for seven and ten years totalling 127.7 million.

The Group has a policy of only dealing with creditworthy tenants and obtaining sufficient rental cash deposits or third party guarantees as a means of mitigating financial loss from defaults.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large and diverse tenant base.
Accordingly the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of rent deposits obtained.
Details of the Groups receivables are summarised in note 13 of the financial statements.
The Groups cash deposits are placed with a diversied range of banks and strict counterparty limits ensure the Groups exposure to bank failure is minimised.
Capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain an appropriate mix of debt and equity nancing.
The current capital structure of the Group consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the Group statement of changes in equity.
Debt comprises long-term debenture stock, private placement notes and drawings against committed revolving credit facilities from banks.
The Group operates solely in the United Kingdom, and its operating profits and net assets are sterling denominated, as a result the Groups policy is to have no unhedged assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.
The currency risk on overseas transactions is fully hedged through foreign currency derivatives to create a synthetic sterling exposure.
Annual review Financials Governance 81 81 16 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group operates a framework for the management of the Groups short-, mediumand long-term funding requirements.
Cash ow and funding needs are regularly monitored to ensure sufficient undrawn facilities are in place.
The Groups funding sources are diversied across a range of bank and bond markets and strict counterparty limits are operated on deposits.
The Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements through the utilisation of its revolving credit facilities.
The availability of these facilities depends on the Group complying with a number of key financial covenants: these covenants and the Groups compliance with these covenants are set out in the table below: March 2012 Key covenants Covenant actuals Group 0.4x Net debt net equity 1.25x Inner borrowing unencumbered asset value unsecured borrowings 1.66x 2.6x Interest cover 1.35x 2.0x The Group has undrawn credit facilities of 297.0 million and has substantial headroom above all of its key covenants.
As a result the directors consider the Group to have adequate liquidity to be able to fund the ongoing operations of the business.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity on its financial instruments and have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash ows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group is required to pay and conditions existing at the balance sheet date: Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2012 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 8% debenture stock 2029 144.2 278.1 8.0 8.0 24.1 238.0 Bank loans 200.1 220.2 4.6 4.6 211.0 Private placement notes 158.8 220.4 8.5 8.5 25.4 178.0 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swap 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.1 Interest rate oor 4.8 4.7 1.9 1.9 0.9 498.4 714.2 19.3 19.3 259.6 416.0 Carrying Contractual Less than One to Two to More than amount cash ows one year two years five years five years At 31 March 2011 m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities 5 142.9 million 5 8% debenture stock 2029 144.2 286.2 8.0 8.0 24.1 246.1 Bank loans 207.9 217.8 5.0 201.1 11.7 Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swap 0.2 0.1 0.1 Interest rate oor 2.7 6.7 1.1 2.2 3.4 349.4 497.5 12.0 207.0 32.4 246.1 Great Portland Estates Annual Report 2012 82 82 PUFT GPSNJOH QBSU PG UIF SPVQ fiOBODJBM TUBUFNFOUT 16 Financial instruments continued Market risk Interest rate risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing financial instruments.
It is the risk that future cash ows from a financial instrument will uctuate due to changes in interest rates.
It is the Groups policy either to eliminate interest rate risk over the cash ows on its long-term debt finance through the use of xed rate debentures or to mitigate the risk through the use of oating to xed interest rate swaps, caps, oors, collars and swaptions.
It is the Groups policy to maintain the proportion of oating interest rate exposure to between 20%40% of forecast total interest rate cost.
Interest rate swaps Interest rate swaps enable the Group to exchange its oating rate interest payments on its bank debt for xed rate payments on a notional value.
Such contracts allow the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash ow exposures on its variable rate bank loans by locking in a xed rate on a proportion of its debt.
Interest rate caps Interest rate caps protect the Group from rises in short-term interest rates by making a payment to the Group when the underlying interest rate exceeds a specified rate the cap rate on a notional value.
If the underlying rate exceeds the cap rate, the payment is based upon the difference between the two rates, ensuring the Group only pays the maximum of the cap rate.
Interest rate oors Under the terms of an interest rate oor, one party the seller makes a payment to the other party the buyer if an underlying interest rate is below a specified rate.
The Group has bought an interest rate oor, which, when combined with its xed rate private placement notes raised in 2011, gives rise to the same economic effect as purchasing an interest rate cap in respect of oating rate debt.
Interest rate swaptions An interest rate swaption provides the Group with an option to enter into an interest rate swap on a specified future exercise date at a set price.
On the exercise date the Group can either enter into the interest rate swap or let the option lapse.
Such contracts act as an insurance policy against future interest rate rises.
Cross currency swaps Cross currency swaps enable the Group to exchange receipts or payments denominated in currencies other than sterling for receipts or payments denominated in sterling.
Such contracts allow the Group to eliminate foreign exchange risk arising from uctuating exchange rates between sterling and other currencies.

23 Employee benets The Group contributes to a dened benefit final salary pension plan the Plan, the assets of which are held by trustees separately from the assets of the Group.
The Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2002.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Plan was conducted at 1 April 2012 by a qualied independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The Plan was valued using the following main assumptions: 2012 2011 % % Discount rate 5.00 5.50 Expected return on Plan assets 4.12 5.45 Expected rate of salary increases 4.25 4.50 Future pension increases 3.25 3.50 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on the Plan assets, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long-term rate of return on Plan assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of an assumption of 4.12% p. a.
During the year, the Group has changed the basis on which ination is estimated from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index.
This has been accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and recorded as an actuarial gain.
This decreased the present value of the dened benefit obligation by 0.4 million.
The Trustee Directors are currently investigating whether the normal pension retirement dates under the plan were equalised in 1991 in accordance with relevant case law.
It is possible that this will result in the plan incurring additional benefit costs: however, it is not possible at this stage to reliably estimate the financial impact on the plan.
