The earnings loss per share and the net asset per share for the year ended 31 March 2008 have been adjusted for the bonus element inherent in the Rights Issue that was approved on 9 March 2009 and the reclassication of the Trillium discontinued operations from continuing activities to discontinued operations.
The restated total dividend payable represents the theoretical dividend per share that would have been paid had the bonus shares inherent in the Rights Issue been in existence at the relevant dividend dates.
In the current year adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share have been restated to exclude profits on disposals of trading properties and long-term development contracts.
The comparatives have been adjusted accordingly.
