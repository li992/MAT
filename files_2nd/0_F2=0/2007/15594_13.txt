The sum of these two effects makes the IAS 19 charge disproportionately higher and more volatile than the cash contributions the Group is required to make in order to fund all future liabilities.
Therefore, within underlying profit we have included the normal cash contributions for pensions but excluded the volatile element of IAS 19 to represent what the Group believes to be a fairer measure of the cost of providing post-employment benefits.
Exceptional items due to their significance and special nature, certain other items which do not reflect the Groups underlying performance have been excluded from underlying profit.
These gains or losses can have a significant impact on both absolute profit and profit trends, consequently, they are excluded from the underlying profit of the Group.
In 2006 07, exceptional items are as follows: Pensions adjustment relating to the Finance Act 2006 Following changes introduced by the Finance Act with effect from April 2006 Pensions A-Day, Tescos UK approved pension schemes have implemented revised terms for members exchanging pension at retirement date, allowing them the option to commute convert a larger amount of their pension to a tax-free lump sum on retirement.
Accordingly, the assumptions made in calculating the defined benefit pension liability have been revised, and a gain of 250m has been recognised in the Income Statement during the year.

As of 24 February 2007, the tax rate change was not substantively enacted.
If this change had been substantively enacted, the deferred tax liability as at 24 February 2007 would have decreased by approximately 31m and the deferred tax expense by approximately 15m.
This would have resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate from 29.1% to 28.5%.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax assets 32 12 Deferred tax liabilities 535 320 503 308 No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, because the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The temporary difference unrecognised at the year end amounted to 565m 2006 461m.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items, because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 98m 2006 27m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 33m 2006 69m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 10m 2006 nil that will expire in 2011 and 22m 2006 nil that will expire in 2027.
Other losses will be carried forward indefinitely.

com corporate Notes to the financial statements continued Note 10 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill Goodwill arising on business combinations is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill may be impaired.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of cashgenerating units according to the level at which management monitor that goodwill.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are based on value in use, which is calculated from cash flow projections for five years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term average growth rates generally 3%-4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 10%-17% 2006: 9%-11%.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital as adjusted for the specific risks relating to each geographical region.
In February 2007, 2006 and 2005 impairment reviews were performed by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
Management determined that there has been no impairment.
The components of goodwill are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 m m m UK 501 466 463 Thailand 113 115 107 South Korea 29 32 10 Japan 115 133 135 China 346 Malaysia 64 Poland 322 331 323 Czech Republic 34 Turkey 47 55 49 Other 1557 1,586 1,137 1,094 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 67 Note 11 Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings Other a Total m m m Cost At 25 February 2006 15,563 4,707 20,270 Foreign currency translation 176 46 222 Additions b 1,925 864 2,789 Acquisitions through business combinations 247 31 278 Reclassification across categories 100 1 99 Classified as held for sale 391 13 404 Disposals 528 155 683 At 24 February 2007 16,540 5,389 21,929 Accumulated depreciation and impairment losses At 25 February 2006 1,815 2,573 4,388 Foreign currency translation 8 17 25 Charge for the year 240 534 774 Reclassification across categories 2 3 1 Classified as held for sale 40 7 47 Disposals 86 69 155 Impairment losses 82 82 Reversal of impairment losses 63 63 At 24 February 2007 1,942 3,011 4,953 Net carrying value c d e At 24 February 2007 14,598 2,378 16,976 At 25 February 2006 13,748 2,134 15,882 Capital work in progress included above f At 24 February 2007 872 158 1,030 a Other assets consist of plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings and motor vehicles.

The measure of volatility used in Tesco PLC option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board consider the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.
b Share bonus schemes Eligible UK employees are able to participate in Shares in Success, an all-employee profit sharing scheme.
Each year, shares are awarded as a percentage of earnings up to a statutory maximum of 3,000.
Senior management also participate in performance-related bonus schemes.
The amount paid to employees is based on a percentage of salary and is paid partly in cash and partly in shares.
Bonuses are awarded to eligible employees that have completed a required service period and depend on the achievement of corporate targets.
The accrued cash element of the bonus at the Balance Sheet date is 17m.
The Executive Directors participate in short-term and long-term bonus schemes designed to align their interests with those of shareholders.
Full details of these schemes can be found in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The fair value of shares awarded under these schemes is their market value on the date of award.
Expected dividends are not incorporated into the fair value.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit schemes for the Groups employees in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 7m 2006 7m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
Defined benefit plans United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
Watson Wyatt Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2005, using the projected unit method.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation the actuarial deficit was 153m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 2,632m and these assets represented 95% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The One Stop Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the company.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 5 April 2004.
Overseas The most significant overseas scheme is the funded defined benefit scheme which operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 1 April 2004.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 24 February 2007.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 24 February 2007.
Buck Consultants Ireland Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19, and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions The valuations used have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 24 February 2007.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 %%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 4.0 3.9 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 2.7 2.6 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.0 2.7 2.6 Rate of increase in career average benefits 3.0 2.7 2.6 Discount rate 5.2 4.8 5.4 Price inflation 3.0 2.7 2.6 The main financial assumption is the real discount rate i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 105m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by between 12m and 13m.
UK mortality assumptions Following analysis of the mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK, which was carried out as part of the formal valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2005, it was decided to alter the mortality assumptions used in the formal valuation.

Future revisions to this assumption will be reflected in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Changes to scheme rules in the Republic of Ireland affecting early retirement have reduced pension liabilities by a further 8m, which is also shown as a past service gain in the Income Statement.

com corporate Notes to the financial statements continued Note 26 Business combinations The Group has made a number of acquisitions in the year, of which the material acquisitions have been disclosed separately and the remainder shown in aggregate.
The net assets and results of the acquired business are included in the consolidated accounts of the Group from the date of acquisition.
Acquisition accounting has been applied and the goodwill arising has been capitalised and is subject to annual impairment testing.
The goodwill acquired in the business combinations listed below has been allocated to the single group of cash-generating units represented by the acquired businesses, as this is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored internally.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions in the year is attributable mainly to customer loyalty, the assembled workforce and the synergies expected to be achieved.
The fair values currently established for acquisitions made in the year to 24 February 2007 are provisional.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to one year from the date of acquisition.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
Had all the combinations listed below taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the operating profit of the Group would have been 2,626m and revenue from continuing operations would have been 43,306m.

Contingent liabilities The Company has irrevocably guaranteed the liabilities, as defined in section 5 c of the Republic of Ireland Amendment Act 1986, of various subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the Republic of Ireland.
Tesco Personal Finance, in which the Group owns a 50% joint venture share, has commitments, as described in its own financial statements as at 31 December 2006, of formal standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend, totalling 5.5bn 2006 6.0bn.
The amount is intended to provide an indication of the volume of business transacted and not of the underlying credit or other risks.
For details of assets held under finance leases, which are pledged as security for the finance lease liabilities, see note 11.
There are a number of contingent liabilities that arise in the normal course of business which if realised are not expected to result in a material liability to the Group.
In connection with the railway tunnel collapse at Gerrards Cross, the Group is currently assessing a number of potential claims.
Due to the nature of those claims it is not currently possible to assess any liabilities or potential recoveries, therefore no provision has been made.
The final outcome is not expected to be material to the Group.

The terms of these sale and leasebacks vary, however, common factors include: the sale of the properties to the joint venture at market value, options at the end of the lease for the Group to repurchase the properties at market value, market rent reviews and 20-25 year lease terms.
The Group reviews the substance as well as the form of the arrangements when making the judgement as to whether these leases are operating or finance leases: the majority of the leases under these arrangements are operating leases.
