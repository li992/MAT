The ESOP trust, which was established in 1994, purchased shares in Enodis plc to meet some of the future obligations under employee option schemes.
Shares are distributed to specified employees upon their exercise of certain options and payment by them of the exercise price.
The Group finances the ESOP trust by way of an interest free loan of 2.0m.
The ESOP trust has waived the right to receive dividends on all shares held.
Costs are borne by Enodis plc and are written-off in the period in which they are incurred.
Foreign currency translation reserve the reserve represents the currency realignment that arises on the translation of interests in the opening net assets of overseas subsidiary entities and associated undertakings, long-term foreign borrowings used to finance overseas investments, and on the translation of the profit and loss account for the period to the closing foreign exchange rate.
Hedging reserve The Group applies hedge accounting, as defined in IAS39 see note 22.
Gains and losses on certain derivative instruments are recognised in the hedging reserve to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Gains and losses are released to profit and loss at the same time as the hedged item impacts earnings.
Other reserves include the Groups reserve for share options where a charge for the option has been recognised but the option has yet to be exercised and the capital redemption reserve in respect of the cancellation of 40.2m shares, with a nominal value of 4.0m, arising from the Groups share buy-back programme.
27 Share-based payments The Group has two share option schemes in place for certain employees with outstanding grants as follows: Executive Share Scheme 1995 : Executive Share Scheme 2001.
During 2007, the Group also made two grants under a new performance share plan which was approved by shareholders at the last AGM.
Exercises of the awards under the Groups share option schemes and performance share plan are generally settled by using new shares of Enodis plc.
102 | Enodis plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Share-based payments continued Under the executive option scheme rules, options are exercisable at a price being the higher of the closing quoted market price of Enodis plcs shares on the dealing day prior to the date of grant and on the date of grant itself.
The performance share plan will deliver an award of shares, at no cost, provided that prescribed performance conditions over the vesting period have been met.
The above plans have a three year vesting period and are subject to prescribed Total Shareholder Return TSR thresholds being met see Directors remuneration report on page 60 for further information on TSR.
Additionally, no options or performance shares may vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that there has been a sustained improvement in the Groups underlying financial performance.
If options and performance shares remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the awards expire.
In most cases, the awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before they vest.
The Group recognised a total charge of 0.9m 2006: 1.6m relating to equity settled share-based payments during the period.
Details of share-based payments in issue over the last two years are as follows: Sharesave Scheme Executive Share Scheme Executive Share Scheme 1992 1995 2001 Performance Share Plan Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average average Number of exercise Number of exercise Number of exercise Number of grant share options price share options price share options price share options price Outstanding at 1 October 2005 24,615 1.83 938,169 1.95 18,662,178 0.82 Granted in the period 2,698,431 1.31 Exercised in the period 142,019 1.17 1,606,667 0.79 Forfeited in the period 235 1.56 43,223 2.54 826,755 1.02 Expired in the period 18,597 1.75 Outstanding at 30 September 2006 5,783 2.10 752,927 2.06 18,927,187 0.89 Granted in the period 2,256,359 2.03 589,514 1.99 Exercised in the period 123,497 1.17 3,539,322 0.85 Forfeited in the period 36,435 2.61 492,721 1.16 Expired in the period 5,783 2.10 24,699 1.17 Outstanding at 29 September 2007 568,296 2.26 17,151,503 1.04 589,514 1.99 Weighted average remaining contractual life years as at 29 September 2007 2.17 6.73 2.72 Exercisable as at: 30 September 2006 752,927 2.06 6,958,150 0.71 29 September 2007 568,296 2.26 9,645,826 0.76 In addition, 52,351 2006: nil shares were issued by the Company in respect of share options granted under the 1993 Executive Share Scheme.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Enodis plc | 103 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27 Share-based payments continued Following the Groups transition to IFRS on 3 October 2004, all share-based payments subsequent to 7 November 2002 are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
In accordance with IFRS, no accounting charge has been recognised for options issued prior to 7 November 2002.
Details of the movement in share options over the last two years that were issued prior to 7 November 2002 are as follows: Sharesave Scheme Executive Share Scheme Executive Share Scheme 1992 1995 2001 Weighted Weighted Weighted average average average exercise exercise exercise Number of price Number of price Number of price share options share options share options Outstanding at 1 October 2005 24,615 1.83 938,169 1.95 2,881,402 0.94 Exercised in the period 142,019 1.17 599,269 0.93 Forfeited in the period 235 1.56 43,223 2.54 135,055 1.41 Expired in the period 18,597 1.75 Outstanding at 30 September 2006 5,783 2.10 752,927 2.06 2,147,078 0.91 Exercised in the period 123,497 1.17 482,251 0.92 Forfeited in the period 36,435 2.61 131,396 0.50 Expired in the period 5,783 2.10 24,699 1.17 Outstanding at 29 September 2007 568,296 2.26 1,533,431 0.95 Weighted average remaining contractual life years as at 29 September 2007 2.17 4.47 Options exercisable as at: 30 September 2006 752,927 2.06 2,147,078 0.91 29 September 2007 568,296 2.26 1,533,431 0.95 During the current financial year, options were granted on 4 January 2007, with a fair value per option of 0.53.
During the previous financial year options were granted on 3 January and 28 September 2006.
The fair values of the options granted on those dates were 0.28 and 0.38 respectively.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes valuation model, as well as incorporating a discount for the schemes market based performance conditions.
A discussion of the Groups market based performance conditions is included in the Directors remuneration report.
The fair value is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the options vesting period.
Inputs into the valuation model were as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 2.03 1.31 Weighted average exercise price 2.03 1.31 Weighted average expected volatility 24.9% 27.0% Expected life years 6.5 6.5 Risk free interest rate 5.0% 4.2% Expected dividend yield 1.5% 1.6% Discount for effects of market based performance conditions 15% 30% Expected volatility has been determined by reference to the historical volatility of Enodis plcs share price over a range of three to four years.
The periods of historical volatility that are used are considered as suitable estimates for the future volatility over the estimated life of the option.
In determining the expected life of the share options management gave consideration to the three year vesting period and the contractual life of ten years from the date of grant.
The mid-point of this range was used, which management believe accommodates the effects of the potential for certain option holders to exercise their options at an earlier date.
Management assesses at the end of each reporting period its estimates in relation to forfeitures.
Over recent years the Groups forfeiture rate has been low.
The Group also has an obligation to pay a cash amount of 0.4m to Mr McCulloch should he exercise a grant of options made in August 2003.
The Group has recognised a liability for this amount as at 29 September 2007.
The 589,514 performance shares outstanding on 29 September 2007 comprise a grant of 506,529 shares on 6 June 2007 and another grant of 82,985 shares on 13 September 2007.
The fair values per share were 1.00 and 1.03, respectively.
The fair value of the performance shares granted during 2007 were determined using a stochastic valuation model which takes account of the schemes market based performance conditions.
The main assumptions used to value the performance shares were as follows: 2007 Weighted average share price 1.99 Weighted average expected volatility 21.2% Expected life years 3 Risk free interest rate 5.6% Expected dividend yield 0% 104 | Enodis plc | Notes to the consolidated financial statements
