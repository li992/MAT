a Tradereceivables:creditrisk The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables and the associated risk management techniques that the Group deploys in order to mitigate this risk are discussed in note 38. Credit periods offered to customers vary according to the credit risk profiles of, and invoicing conventions established in, the various markets in which the Group operates.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are considered overdue in the relevant market.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the combined and consolidated income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
The total gross carrying value of these impaired trade receivables as at the reporting date is 54 million 2006: 63 million and the associated aggregate impairment is 37 million 2006: 43 million.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 103 million 2006: 75 million which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: Trade receivables past due by Less than More than million 1 month 1-2 months 2-3 months 3 months Total Carrying value at 31 December 2007 56 18 15 14 103 Carrying value at 31 December 2006 44 10 12 9 75 Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balances are debtor balances with customers totalling 3 million 2006: 2 million where contractual terms have been renegotiated to extend the credit period offered.
The Group believes that these balances are fully recoverable and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised.
The Group has entered into certain debt factoring arrangements in which the financial counterparties retain recourse in the event of debtor default.
Accordingly, the Group continues to recognise the underlying trade receivables transferred until cash settlement occurs.
A concurrent financing liability is also recognised in respect of the obligation to transfer economic benefit to financial counterparties.
At the reporting date, trade receivables with a value of 1 million 2006: 7 million are subject to such factoring arrangements and an associated financial liability of 1 million 2006: 7 million has been recognised.
