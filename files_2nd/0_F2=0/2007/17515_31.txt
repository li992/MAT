The 2006 Pro Forma Income Statement and segmental information for the Group is prepared to illustrate the effect the Falconbridge, Cerrejn and Tintaya acquisitions, rights issue, the May 2006 new shares issue and related debt draw downs, would have had if they had taken place on 1 January 2006.
The pro forma information for 2006 excludes certain exceptional items relating to the Falconbridge acquisition, so as not to distort the results of the Group by these one off items.
