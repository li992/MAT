IFRS requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Significant management judgment is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to assess its potential liability.
On the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group.
However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any annual period could be materially affected by an unfavourable resolution of these matters.
