Amendment to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1998 was written off to Capital Disclosures' reserves.
From 1998, goodwill, being the difference between IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosure' the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the assets acquired, was capitalised in the balance sheet as Standards, interpretations and amendments to published goodwill and until 31st December 2003 was amortised on a standards that are not yet effective straight line basis over its estimated useful life, not exceeding Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to 20 years.

AGA FOODSERVICE GROUP ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 Page 46 Notes to the accounts Employee share options IFRS 2 Share-based Payments requires that an expense for equity instruments granted is recognised in the financial statements based on its fair value at the date of grant.
This expense, which is primarily in relation to employee share options and Executive LTIP schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the schemes - the Group has principally adopted the Black Scholes model and a TSR pricing model, respectively, for the purposes of computing fair value under IFRS.
The measurement of this expense is calculated only on options granted after 7th November 2002.
For LTIP options granted in 2007 the performance criteria is now 50% based on a TSR pricing model and 50% on EPS growth against RPI.
The estimation of share-based payments costs requires the selection of an appropriate valuation model, consideration as to the inputs necessary for the valuation model chosen and the estimation of the number of awards that will ultimately vest, inputs which arise from judgements relating to the probability of meeting non-market performance conditions and the continuing participation of employees.
Any awards that do not ultimately vest are lapsed.
Dividends The final dividend is only recognised at the point it is declared and approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised on payment.
Provisions Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products still under warranty.
Product warranties of between one and three years are given, where appropriate, by individual businesses in the Group.
Following the disposal programme of previous years certain vacant properties located in the UK remain with the Group.
Full provision has been made for the residual onerous lease commitments, together with other outgoings, for the remaining period of the leases.
The Group's other provisions relate to the remaining costs in respect of the disposal of the Pipe Systems and Foodservice operations, including probable warranty and indemnity claims, other claims and other costs from third parties in relation to divested businesses.
Provisions are not discounted where the effect is not material.
Non-recurring costs The Group presents as non-recurring items on the face of the income statement, those items of income and expense which, because of the non-recurring nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better the elements of financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in financial performance.

Segmental analysis Following the sale of the Foodservice operations the directors have re-organised the way in which the businesses report internally.
Based on risks and returns the directors still consider that the primary reporting format is by business segment.
The directors consider that there is only one business segment being the manufacture and sale of range cookers and related equipment.
Therefore the majority of the disclosures for the primary segment have already been given in these financial statements with the exception of some restated comparatives.

Pensions The Group operates a pension scheme which covers the majority of United Kingdom employees.
Membership on a defined benefit basis was closed in 2001 but the scheme remains open to new entrants on a defined contribution basis.
The assets are held in trust funds separate from the Groups assets although they are included in the Groups balance sheet.
Following the Foodservice disposal the defined benefit schemes operated within the Group are the Amari plc Pension and Life Assurance Plan in the UK and the Waterford Stanley scheme in Europe.
Various defined contribution schemes exist across the Group and the total contributions in the year were 1.4m 2006: 1.4m included in note 4, staff costs.
The latest full valuation of the main United Kingdom scheme was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP, independent consulting actuaries, as at 31st December 2005 using the projected unit credit method.
Group defined benefit scheme contributions of 4.4m 2006: 4.8m based on pensionable salaries and an additional 14.5m were made during the year ended 31st December 2007 including a 10m contribution on the sale of the Foodservice operations as agreed with the Trustee.
Contributions of 0.4m 2006: 0.4m were owed to the schemes at 31st December 2007.
Contributions for 2008 under the main UK scheme will be 5.5% 2006: 13.9% for all members accruing benefits on a final salary basis with the exception of members of the former 1970 scheme and 27.4% 2006: 27.4% for members of the former 1970 scheme.
Company contributions of around 1.3m are expected to be paid to this scheme during 2008.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit schemes liabilities under IAS 19 were: Waterford UK Stanley UK European Schemes 2007 Scheme 2007 Schemes 2006 Schemes 2006 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.1% 3.4% 3.9% 3.04.0% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.53.5% 2.4% 2.253.3% Discount rate 5.8% 5.5% 5.2% 4.04.3% Inflation rate 3.1% 2.4% 2.9% 2.0% Expected rate of return on schemes plan assets 6.4% 6.4% 6.25% 4.5% The overall expected rate of return on assets is the average of the best estimate for the expected long-term rate of return for each of the major asset classes weighted according to the percentage allocation of the aggregated assets to each of the asset classes at the reporting date.
The demographic assumptions used include rates for mortality which, for example, generally lead to an average projected life expectancy of 18 years for male members currently aged 65 and of 19.1 years from age 65 for male members currently aged 50.
The assets and obligations of the aggregated schemes were: 2007 2006 m m Equities 256.4 343.3 Bonds 372.9 290.7 Property 116.5 130.6 Other 31.1 20.0 Fair value of schemes assets 776.9 784.6 Present value of funded obligation 697.3 760.2 Surplus in the schemes 79.6 24.4 Balance sheet presentation: Retirement benefit asset 80.4 29.9 Retirement benefit obligation 0.8 5.5 Surplus in the schemes 79.6 24.4 Included above are assets with a market value of 3.2m 2006: 4.8m and a deficit of 0.6m 2006: 2.7m in respect of overseas schemes.
The foreign exchange impact on the overseas schemes is not significant.

Earnings per share The basic earnings per share for total operations is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of the parent by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential shares the share options granted to employees and the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The Group provides for trade receivables on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods based on the age of debt, past default experience and any other information which comes to light which suggests that the recoverable amount may be impaired.
The main operating units in the UK participate in a credit insurance policy.
This covers 90% of individual debts in these units up to specific insured limits.
The Group uses external agencies to credit score new customers where appropriate to assess their credit quality and define an initial credit limit.
Limits and credit scoring are reviewed as necessary.
Aged debt reports are reviewed by local management on a regular basis with debt at risk forms being formally submitted to Group on a monthly basis.
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date the Group first traded with that company.
Credit risk is mitigated by the relatively large customer base.
Included in trade receivables continuing businesses only are balances of 8.8m 2006: 8.8m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk a Forward foreign exchange contracts As a result of the Groups geographical presence and operations, forward foreign currency contracts put in place are primarily denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
There were no forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at the balance sheet date 2006: nil.
As at 31st December 2007, the notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to were AUD 0.5m 2006: AUD nil, GBP nil 2006: GBP 3.9m, CHF nil 2006: CHF 1.9m, EUR 1.5m 2006: EUR 1.4m and USD 1.0m 2006: USD 5.6m.
The fair value of these open forward foreign exchange contracts approximate to their carrying amount.
The contracts have been put in place to mitigate the foreign currency risk of anticipated future sales and purchase commitments and mature over the next twelve months.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities The Group has Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings, which it has designated as a hedge of a proportion of its investment in its subsidiaries in Europe and the US.
The fair value of such Euro borrowings at 31st December 2007 was 5.5m 2006: 29.7m and the fair value of the US Dollar borrowings was 1.8m 2006: 17.2m.
The exchange difference on the translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in translation reserves.
b Liquidity risk The Group maintains a mixture of short-term, uncommitted and medium-term, committed facilities to ensure a sufficient level of funds are available for its business operations.
The 110m committed facilities have been arranged to help finance the expansion of the Groups activities.
These facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.

Further information is set out in the remuneration report on pages 32 to 37.
Share based payments The Senior Executive Share Option Scheme was approved in 1994.
Under the scheme the remuneration committee was able to grant options over shares in the Company to senior executives of the Group, although the scheme lapsed in May 2004.
Options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under the option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option was ten years.
Options granted under the scheme will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the Groups earnings per share exceeding, by at least 3% per annum, the increase in the UKs retail price index over a period of three years beginning not earlier than the Companys last financial year before the date of an option grant.
The exercise of an option is subject to continued employment or other circumstances in the scheme rules.
Options granted since November 2002 were valued using Black-Scholes option model.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP was introduced in 1999 as an appropriate method to incentivise executives and senior management.
The LTIP consists of a right to acquire shares at a nominal price of 1 which will be exercisable after a period of three years at the earliest.
For options granted before 2007 the actual percentage of shares that can be acquired depends on two performance criteria.
The first of these is a comparison of the Companys total shareholder return TSR with the TSR of companies in a comparator group approved by the remuneration committee at the date of grant and the second is that the remuneration committee determines that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company see remuneration report on pages 32 to 37.
In 2007, the remuneration committee revised the performance criteria so that 50% of the award was based on the TSR of companies in a comparator group by the remuneration committee at the date of grant and 50% of the award is monitored against an EPS target, where growth of at least 3% compound in excess of RPI over the three year performance period is required for 25% of the award to vest.
If growth exceeds 10% compound in excess of RPI then all will vest.
None of the EPS monitored options will vest if compound growth is less than 3%.
The fair value per option of the LTIPs granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: Grant date 14th May 2007 27th April 2006 Share price at grant date 385.75p 386.6p Exercise price 1 1 Number of employees 58 54 Shares under option 550,492 246,627 Vesting period years 3 3 Expected volatility 35.1% 34.9% Option life years 10 10 Expected life years 3 3 Correlation of pair of shares in comparator group not applicable for EPS element 21% 12% Expected dividend expressed as a dividend yield 2.5% 2.7% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 90% 90% Fair value per option TSR element EPS element 2.28 3.75 2.30 NA The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over ten years.
The expected life is the average expected to exercise.
A Monte Carlo model was used to value TSR performance conditions for the LTIP.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 0.9m 2006: 0.4m before tax and 0.6m post tax 2006: 0.3m.

Acquisitions continued Impact of IFRS Restatement of comparative information Since transition to IFRS the Group has continued to assess the detailed impact of IFRS on the presentation of the Groups consolidated financial statements.
It has now been concluded that the deferred taxation liabilities on brands acquired, since the transition date, which are deemed to have an indefinite life should be recognised, and in accordance with IAS 8, the 2006 deferred taxation and goodwill balances have been restated by 3.0m.
Under IFRS 3 fair values of the net assets of acquired businesses are finalised within twelve months of the acquisition date.
All fair value adjustments are recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and as a consequence may result in the restatement of previously reported financial results.
Fair values of the net assets acquired for Eloma and Amana, both 2006 acquisitions, have now been finalised.
This has resulted in a restatement of 2006 deferred taxation and goodwill balances, relating to the brands, of 0.5m and 2.0m for Eloma and Amana respectively.
The above adjustments do not affect the consolidated income statement, cashflow or retained earnings.
