com Remuneration Report Pension and Retirement benefits 62.
The pension provided for Ian Coull comes from two sources.
In respect of his salary up to the HMRC Notional Earnings Cap currently 112,800 Ian Coull accrues pension in the SEGRO Pension Scheme, formerly the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the SEGRO Scheme.
The remaining pension is accrued via the UURB which is detailed on page 63.
Pension policy for Executive Directors has not been changed during 2007.
Pensions for John Heawood and David Sleath are provided through the SEGRO Scheme.
Both John Heawood and David Sleath may retire at age 62 or any time up to age 65.
Their pension benefits were agreed to broadly target a pension at age 62 of two-thirds of final pensionable salary less any retained benefits from previous employment.
Depending on future experience, the pensions that they actually receive may be higher or lower than this.
Upon reaching the target, John Heawood and David Sleath may then accrue a 1 60th of final pensionable salary for every completed year of subsequent service, which is in line with ordinary members of the SEGRO Scheme.
The SEGRO Scheme is contracted-out of the State Second Pension and is HMRC registered.
It has been registered with the Pensions Regulator.
Set out below are details of the pension benefits to which each of the Executive Directors are entitled in respect of the disclosure required by paragraph 12 2 Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985.
The values given below include the effect of inflation in their calculation.

They do not represent sums payable to individual Directors.
The figures shown in the table above for Marshall Lees have been calculated in a consistent manner with previous years disclosures.
However, Marshall Lees left the Company on 1 August 2007 following the sale of Slough Estates USA.
The figures in the table above are therefore shown at 1 August 2007 rather than 31 December 2007.
On leaving the Company, Marshall Lees total benefit entitlement was as follows: An annuity with a cost of $4,630,366 of which $1,791,026 is in respect of a tax gross-up United of Omaha Life Insurance Company deferred annuity at normal retirement date of $28,951 per annum: Slough Parks Incorporated Money Purchase Pension Plan fund value of $242,246 Slough Parks Incorporated 401 k Profit Sharing Plan fund value of $104,052: and A deferred pension from the SEGRO Scheme of 7,866 p. a. plus future revaluation payable from normal retirement date.
The accrued pension entitlement is the amount of retained benefit that the Executive Directors would be entitled to if they left service at the year end.
Retained benefits are payable from normal retirement age.
The Group had provided Marshall Lees, a resident of the USA, with a pension entitlement broadly equivalent to the benefit that he would receive had he continued to be a member of the SEGRO Scheme until his date of leaving, 1 August 2007.
His entire pension liability, excluding his UK liability, was met following the completion of the sale of Slough Estates USA and he resigned from his position on the Board.
There are no further liabilities in respect of Marshall Lees pension other than his retained pension in the SEGRO Scheme.
Marshall Lees has a deferred pension under the SEGRO Scheme but is no longer accruing any additional benefits.
Walter Hens participates in the pension plan which is established for Belgian employees.
This arrangement is a defined contribution arrangement which is based with an insurance company.
As a participant in this plan the Company makes a contribution on behalf of Walter Hens of 9.725 per cent of salary and Walter Hens is required to contribute 4.8 per cent of salary.
He has no pension benefits under the SEGRO Scheme.
In addition to participating in a defined contribution arrangement there is a deferred compensation arrangement, held in Belgium, in respect of Walter Hens which he will be the beneficiary of in 2013 or earlier if he should choose to take his Belgian State Pension sooner than 2013.
The contributions to this arrangement were bonus payments which Walter Hens has been awarded in previous years of service.
No contributions to this arrangement have been made since 2004 and no further contributions will be made.

David Sleath 9,657 62,143 Ian Coulls Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme UURBS Arrangement Ian Coull will be entitled at age 62 to a total pension of twothirds of his final pensionable salary less any retained benefits from prior employment.
Final pensionable salary and retained benefits will be as defined in the rules as modified by the UURBS of the SEGRO Scheme, of which he is a member.
His entitlement to a pension from the Company will consist of a pension from the SEGRO Scheme and a company pension for which provision is being made in the accounts.
The scheme pension will be the maximum that could be paid from the SEGRO Scheme without prejudicing the former HMRC approval limits subject to a maximum of his total pension entitlement.
The Company pension will be the balance of the total pension over and above the SEGRO Scheme pension.
The Company will provide the company pension by means of the UURBs.
It may be provided either as a regular monthly income in retirement, or a cash lump sum in lieu of the pension which would otherwise have been payable.
Pension Entitlement in the Event of Severance On leaving service before retirement age, the Executive Directors with the exception of Marshall Lees and Walter Hens see above are entitled to either a deferred pension calculated at the date of leaving and which is payable from Normal Retirement Age or a transfer value payable to another pension scheme in respect of those benefits.
Former Directors Ex-gratia payments to former Directors and their dependants were 65,148 2006: 84,740.
Lord MacGregor, a former Director, was appointed as a Company nominated Trustee of the SEGRO Scheme on 1 June 2006.
He received fees from the Company of 30,000 2006: 15,703.
Richard Kingston, a former Director, was appointed as a Company nominated Trustee of the SEGRO Scheme on 1 January 2007.

Basis of preparation and consolidation Basis of preparation SEGRO plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The Company and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Group.
These financial statements are presented in sterling since that is the currency in which the majority of the Groups transactions are denominated.
The consolidated and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, IFRIC Interpretations, and the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
In addition, the Group has also followed best practice recommendations issued by the European Public Real Estate Association EPRA as appropriate.
The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption offered by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present a separate income statement for the parent company.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of properties, available-for-sale investments and financial assets and liabilities held for trading.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Management believes that the judgements, estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable, however actual results may differ from these estimates.
Critical judgements, where made, are disclosed within the relevant section of the financial statements to which such judgements have been applied.
The key estimates and assumptions relate to the property valuations applied by the Groups property valuers, the actuarial assumptions used in calculating the Groups retirement benefit obligations, valuation of share options granted under share based payment schemes, and in the determination of the valuation of available-for-sale investments, and are described in more detail in the accounting policy notes below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements, prepared up to 31 December 2007, comprise the financial statements of the Company and the Group, plus the Groups share of the results and net assets of the joint ventures and associates.
The Company holds investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates at cost.
A joint venture is a contract under which the Group and other parties undertake an activity or invest in an entity, under joint control.
The Group uses equity accounting for such entities, carrying its investment at cost plus the movement in the Groups share of net assets after acquisition, less impairment.
Presentation of Group income statement The Group income statement has been presented by analysing the results into three columns: Adjusted Income and Expense, Adjustments and Total Income and Expense.
In addition, the results of the property joint ventures and associates have been included immediately after net property rental income and profit on sale of trading properties.
This differs from the normal position set out in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, so as to reflect the property income of the Group together within the Group income statement.
The adjustments column represents items that have been recommended by the Best Practices Committee of EPRA as requiring adjustment in arriving at the EPRA adjusted measure of earnings per share, together with items classified as exceptional items, separately disclosed for their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
Details of amounts included within the adjustments column are set out in Note 13.
The presentation, as set out above, has been adopted so as to explain more clearly the different aspects of the Groups financial performance.
Foreign currency and exchange Foreign currency transactions Foreign currency transactions are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling on the transaction date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from settling these, or from retranslating monetary assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies, are booked in the Group income statement.
The exception is for foreign currency loans that hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries, where exchange differences are booked in equity until the investment is realised.
com Notes to the financial statements 1.
Consolidation of foreign entities Assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Their income, expenses and cash flows are translated at the average rate for the period or at spot rate for significant items.
Resultant exchange differences are booked in the revenue reserve, and recognised in the income statement when the operation is sold.
Property portfolio Investment property These properties comprise freehold and leasehold properties and are first measured at cost including transaction costs, then revalued to market value at each reporting date by professional valuers.
Leasehold properties are shown gross of the leasehold payables which are accounted for as finance lease obligations.
Valuation gains and losses in a period are taken to the income statement, and then reclassified to revaluation reserves until realisation on the sale of the property.
As the Group uses the fair value model as per IAS 40, no depreciation is provided.
Existing investment properties being redeveloped to earn future rental income continue to be treated as investment properties.
Development properties and owner occupied properties These comprise properties acquired to be developed for future use as investment properties, as well as completed properties occupied by Group entities, and are initially measured at cost including capitalised interest where applicable.
Owner occupied properties are depreciated over their estimated useful lives usually 30 years.
Development properties are fair-valued on the same basis as investment properties with revaluation movements being booked in the revaluation reserve through the statement of recognised income and expense, with deficits below cost taken to the income statement.
Subsequent revaluation gains are taken to the income statement, but only to the extent of cumulative net deficits previously charged to the income statement.
Trading properties These are properties developed and held for sale, and are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct expenditure and capitalised interest.
Property purchases and sales Property purchases and sales are recognised on the date of unconditional exchange, or, where exchange is conditional, on the date that the conditions have been satisfied.
Leases Leases where substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the lessee, are classified as finance leases.
All others are deemed operating leases.
Under finance leases, the asset leased out is not shown in the Groups balance sheet, but the present value of the minimum lease payments is booked as a receivable.
Lease income is recognised over the lease term using the net investment method before tax, which reflects a constant effective interest rate on the outstanding balance.
Under operating leases, properties leased to tenants are accounted for as investment properties.
In cases where only the buildings part of a property lease qualifies as a finance lease, the land is shown as an investment property.
Revenue Revenue includes rent, income from service charges and proceeds from the sale of trading properties.
The sales of electricity, water and steam arising from Slough Heat & Power and recognised when these services have been delivered to the customer have been classified as discontinued operations.
Rental income This includes net income from managed operations.
Rentals from properties let as operating leases are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives and initial costs to arrange leases are capitalised, then amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
For properties let as finance leases, minimum lease receipts are apportioned between finance income and principal repayment, but receipts that were not fixed at lease inception e. g. rent review rises, are booked as income when earned.
Surrender premiums received in the period are included in rental income.
Service charges and other recoveries from tenants These include income in relation to service charges, directly recoverable expenditure and management fees.
Revenue from services is recognised by reference to the state of completion of the relevant services provided at the reporting date.
Proceeds from sale of trading properties A trading property is regarded as sold when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer on the date of unconditional exchange, or, for conditional exchanges, when all the conditions have been satisfied.
SEGRO plc Notes to the financial statements Annual Report 2007 1.
Borrowing, borrowing costs and derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between the amount initially recognised and the redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings, using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs Gross borrowing costs relating to direct expenditure on properties under development or undergoing major refurbishment are capitalised.
The interest capitalised is calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing.
Interest is capitalised as from the commencement of the development work until the date of practical completion.
The capitalisation of finance costs is suspended if there are prolonged periods when development activity is interrupted.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivatives especially interest rate swaps in managing interest rate risk, and does not use them for trading.
They are recorded, and subsequently revalued, at fair value, with revaluation gains or losses being immediately taken to the income statement.
The exception is for derivatives qualifying as hedges, when the treatment of the gain loss depends upon the item being hedged.
None of the Groups interest rate derivatives qualify as a hedge.
However, there are USD and Euro forward currency sales that have been designated as effective net investment hedges.
Other assets, liabilities and exceptional items Available-for-sale AFS investments These are non-derivative financial assets, that are not held for trading, but are designated as available for sale.
They primarily include investments in Charterhouse USA, Candover and certain warrants in US corporate tenants.
Investments are initially measured at cost, and then revalued to market value based on quarterly reports received from the fund manager, or other market evidence where publicly traded.
Gains and losses arising from valuation are taken to equity, and then recycled through the income statement on realisation.
If there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, any cumulative loss recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables are booked at fair value.
An impairment provision is created where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect in full.
Trade and other payables are stated at cost, since cost is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits held with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Employee benefits Pensions Defined benefit schemes The schemes assets are measured at fair value, their obligations are calculated at discounted present value, and any net surplus or deficit is recognised in the balance sheet.
Operating and financing costs are charged to the income statement, with service costs spread systematically over employees working lives, and financing costs expensed in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised through equity in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Where the actuarial valuation of the scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognisable asset is limited to that for which the Group can benefit in the future.
Professional actuaries are used in relation to defined benefit schemes and the assumptions made are outlined in Note 27.
Share-based payments The cost of granting share options and other share-based remuneration is recognised in the income statement at their fair value at grant date.
They are expensed straight-line over the vesting period, based on estimates of the shares or options that will eventually vest.
Charges are reversed if it appears that performance will not be met.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes model, with any assumptions used in the valuation outlined in Note 42.
Own shares held in connection with employee share plans or other share based payment arrangements are treated as treasury shares and deducted from equity, and no profit or loss is recognised on their sale, issue or cancellation.
Tax Current tax The current tax charge is based on results for the year, adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowable.
It is calculated using rates that are enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax This is the tax expected to be paid or recovered on differences between the reported value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
The Group uses the balance sheet liability method, under which tax liabilities are usually recognised for all taxable temporary differences, but tax assets are recognised only to the extent that taxable profits are expected to be available against which to utilise temporary differences.
The carrying amount of tax assets is reviewed each reporting date and reduced if full recoverability is not expected.
Tax is calculated at rates expected to apply in the period the liability settles or the asset is realised, and is booked to the income statement.
Where it relates to items accounted for in equity, however, the tax is also dealt with in equity.
Tax assets and liabilities are offset when they are levied by the same tax authority and the Group is entitled to settle net.
From 1 January 2007, no deferred tax is recognised on UK or French investment properties covered by the REIT SIIC regimes.
All deferred tax liabilities relating to the properties in the REIT were released to the income statement on 31 December 2006, while deferred tax liabilities relating to properties in the SIIC were released in 2007.

Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to the quoted market prices.
Financial guarantees are issued by the Parent entity to support bank borrowings of 100 per cent owned subsidiary companies domiciled overseas.
The face value of these borrowings is already included in the Group balance sheet.
As the borrowing entity will have unencumbered directly owned property assets exceeding the value of the guaranteed borrowings the probability of the Parent entity having to recognise any loss in respect to these guarantees is considered to be highly unlikely.
Hence no fair value liability has been ascribed to these guarantees in the accounts of the Parent entity.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns and as such it aims to maintain a prudent mix between debt and equity financing.
The current capital structure of the Group is considered appropriate and consists of a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in Notes 29 to 37.
Debt primarily comprises long-term debt issues and drawings against mediumterm committed revolving credit facilities from banks as disclosed in Note 24.

Gearing ratio The capital structure and key financial ratios of the Group are regularly projected forward with various sensitivity assumptions and are reviewed quarterly by the Treasury Risk Committee and are reported to the Group Board.
The Group has no target gearing ratio instead preferring to adopt a ratio that is appropriate to market circumstances at any given time.
Normally it would not expect gearing to go above 80 per cent for any extended period of time.
Group 2007 2006 The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: m m Debt 2,049.4 2,384.8 Cash 348.3 161.4 Net debt 1,701.1 2,223.4 Equity 2,989.0 3,372.7 Deferred tax attributable to investment and development properties 67.0 276.1 Net debt to equity ratio % 57 66 Ratio adjusted for deferred tax % 56 61 The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Corporate Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyses exposures by degree and magnitude of risk.
These include market risk including currency risk and fair value interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and nonderivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function reports quarterly to the Groups Treasury Risk Committee, a sub committee of the Group Board, that monitors risks and policies implemented to mitigate financial risk exposures.
Foreign currency risk management The Group does not have any regular transactional foreign currency exposures as it does not have any regular business involving cross border currency flows.
However it does have operations in Europe which transact business denominated mostly in Euros.
Hence there is currency exposure caused by translating the local trading performance and local net assets into Sterling for each financial period and at each balance sheet date.
The Groups approach to managing balance sheet translation exposure is to fund investment into overseas locations with debt or currency swaps denominated in the same currency of the asset base with a target for the maximum permitted level of currency net assets exposed to fall within a range of between 10 per cent 25 per cent of the value of currency gross assets.
By managing balance translation exposure in this way the impact of translating overseas generated profits has been minimal so these are not specifically hedged.

Foreign currency sensitivity analysis Following the sale of Slough Estates USA Inc the Groups overseas operations are now domiciled in Europe hence its main currency exposure is to the Euro.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 per cent change in the value of Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10 per cent is the sensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10 per cent change in foreign currency rates.
This analysis includes external loans and currency contracts as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or borrower.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or other equity where Sterling has weakened against the relevant currency.
For a 10 per cent strengthening of Sterling there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and equity and the balances would be negative.

Forward foreign exchange contracts In the current year, the Group has entered into various forward sales and currency swap contracts.
Some of these are designated as net investment hedges, and hedge accounted.
The others are effectively cash flow hedges, using the surplus cash in one currency to temporarily fund paying off debt in another currency.
These have not been designated as hedges and as a consequence their change in fair value is taken through the income statement.
The following table details the forward foreign currency contracts outstanding as at the year end: Average Currency contract exchange rates local currency Contract value Fair value 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 rate rate m m m m m m Group Cash flow hedges Sell Euros buy Sterling 1.41 267.1 196.4 7.2 Sell Euros buy US dollars 1.42 60.2 44.3 1.3 Sell US dollars buy Can dollars 1.57 15.9 8.0 3.6 Net investment hedges Sell US dollars buy Sterling 1.96 464.5 237.0 0.3 Sell Euros buy Sterling 1.38 1.49 200.0 100.0 147.1 67.6 1.8 0.5 10.3 3.4 Company Cash flow hedges Sell Euros buy Sterling 2.79 1.49 467.1 100.0 343.5 67.6 9.0 0.5 Sell Euros buy US dollars 1.42 60.2 44.3 1.3 Sell US dollars buy Sterling 1.96 464.5 237.0 0.3 10.3 0.2 The Group does not have any currency exposures caused by trading cash flows or any commitments expressed in a currency other than that of the reporting entity except in Central Europe where although local entities are obliged to report in their local currency units operation of the property industry in these countries is denominated in Euros.
The Group therefore considers its currency of operation for these countries is the Euro.
Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The current Group policy states that around 85 per cent of gross borrowings should be at fixed rate provided by long-term debt issues attracting a fixed coupon or from floating rate bank borrowings converted into fixed rate or hedged via interest rate swaps, forwards, caps, collars or floors or options on these products.
Hedging activities require the approval of the Treasury Risk Committee and are evaluated and reported on regularly to ensure that the policy is being adhered to.
The Group Board reviews the policy on interest rate exposure annually with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1 per cent increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Financial instruments and fair values continued 101.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 would decrease increase by 3.1 million 2006 decrease increase by 2.5 million.
This is attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings and cash deposits.
Fixed rate debt issues are held at amortised cost and are not re-valued in the balance sheet to reflect interest rate movements.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The following tables detail the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Economic cash flow hedges Outstanding pay fixed receive floating contracts are as follows: Average contract fixed interest rate Notional principal amount Fair value 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 % % m m m m Group In one year or less 3.2 5.3 6.3 186.0 0.1 In more than one year but less than two 3.2 6.0 0.1 In more than two years but less than five 4.0 4.1 568.3 317.0 4.1 2.5 Total 574.6 509.0 4.2 2.6 Company In one year or less 5.3 186.0 In more than two years but less than five 4.1 4.3 423.0 178.0 1.5 1.3 Total 423.0 364.0 1.5 1.3 The above are effective economic hedges although the Group has not elected to adopt hedge accounting for them.
Hence their change in fair value is taken direct to the income statement rather than to other equity.
The interest rate swaps settle on either a 3 month or 6 month basis with the floating rate side based on the EURIBOR rate for the relevant period.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
Potential customers are evaluated for creditworthiness and where necessary collateral is secured.
There is no concentration of credit risk within the lease portfolio to either business sector or individual company as the Group has a well spread diverse customer base with no one customer accounting for more than 3 per cent of the gross rent roll.
Trade receivables which include unpaid rent and amounts receivable in respect of property disposals were less than 1 per cent of total assets at 31 December 2007 and at 31 December 2006.
The Directors are of the opinion that the credit risk associated with unpaid rent is low.
In excess of 95 per cent of rent due is generally collected within 21 days of the due date.
Financial instruments and fair values continued 102.
Investment in financial instruments is restricted to short-term liquid funds with a good credit rating.
Derivative financial instruments are transacted via ISDA agreements with counterparties with a good investment grade credit rating.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits which are monitored daily.
The limits are set by the Groups treasury policy document and exposure is reported quarterly to the Treasury Risk Committee.
The policy itself is reviewed annually by the Group Board of Directors.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by having a policy that requires adequate cash and committed bank facilities remain available to cover and match all debt maturities, development spend and trade related and corporate cash flows forward over a rolling 12 month period.
This is achieved by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group policy is that there should always be a minimum 300 million of undrawn committed funds availability for a period 12 months forward after allowing for all projected cash flows over such period.
The actual liquidity position at year end 2007 was 348.3 million of cash plus 788.2 million of undrawn bank facilities 2006 161.4 million cash plus 509.9 million undrawn bank facilities.
Liquidity and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity profile for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
Financial instruments and fair values continued 103. Credit and liquidity risk management The following tables detail the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

Retirement benefit schemes Background The Group has two defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Slough Estates 1957 Pension Scheme the Slough scheme and the Bilton Group Pension Scheme the Bilton scheme.
Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, assessed according to the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the income statement so as to spread the pensions cost over employees working lives with the Group.
The Bilton scheme was closed to new members from 2003, and the Slough scheme from October 2005.
Valuation of the Slough and Bilton schemes has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 for Slough and 5 April 2004 for Bilton and updated by the independent actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2007.
Assets of both schemes are stated at their market value at 31 December 2007.
The Company has an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme UURBS for one employee, the Chief Executive.
This arrangement is a defined benefit in nature.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise uses assumptions which are consistent with those used for the Slough scheme.
There are no assets supporting this UURBS.
The Group had an UURBS through Slough Estates USA Incorporated for one employee.
This was a US dollar denominated defined benefit arrangement.
The calculation of the value of this unapproved benefit promise used assumptions which were consistent with the Slough scheme and consistent with a US dollar denominated liability.
There were no assets supporting this UURBS.
On 1 August 2007, the US property business was sold, with the remaining liability in relation to this scheme transferred as part of the sale.
SEGRO plc Notes to the financial statements Annual Report 2007 27.
In the Netherlands the Group has two schemes.
One is an insured arrangement with a notional investment portfolio and therefore the amount of assets can only be estimated from the local reserve.
However, no contributions have been paid for 2007 and as a consequence there are no assets as at 31 December 2007.
The Group has a number of defined contribution schemes in the UK and overseas which were all expensed to the income statement.
Additionally, the Group has paid supplementary ex-gratia pensions of 0.2 million 2006 0.2 million that were paid out of profits.

Asset class returns are based on a forward looking building block approach.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of an equity risk premium above the risk free rate which is measured in accordance with the yields on government bonds.
Returns on property are assumed to be 1 per cent per annum lower than those on equities.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.

During the period ended 31 December 2007, the Group had five share-based payment arrangements, which are described below.
In each case, the expected volatility was determined by calculating historical volatility of the Groups share price over multiple time periods.

The employee would normally have to remain with the Group for the three year period.
If the performance conditions have not been met by the third anniversary of the date of the grant the options lapse.
The performance criteria are based on an increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share by the Retail Price Index RPI plus 3 per cent per annum over the three year period.
