110 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 1 Statement of accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom UK and the provisions of the Companies Act.
It has been prepared on the historical cost basis where appropriate.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not Cable & Wireless Group the Group which it heads.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements, except as detailed in note 10.
1.2 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the change has a material impact on the reported results for the period.
1.3 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
The cost of fixed assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs.
Interest incurred up to the time that separately identifiable major capital projects are ready for service is also capitalised as part of the cost of assets.
Where the Company has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle and remove its assets and restore the relevant sites, a provision is made for the estimated costs of the asset retirement obligation.
The present value of the asset retirement obligation is capitalised as part of the initial cost of the asset.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or projects under construction.
On other tangible fixed assets, depreciation is provided on the difference between the cost of tangible fixed assets and the estimated residual value, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for use.
These lives are: Lives Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold land and buildings up to 40 years or term of lease if less Profits and losses on disposals of tangible fixed assets are determined by reference to sale proceeds and net book values.
1.4 Asset impairment Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
Where an impairment indicator is identified, the carrying value of the income-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised.
1.5 Investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at valuation.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the balance sheet at cost.
1.6 Financial investments The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available for sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the assets are held.
The basis of determining fair values are set out in note 1.13.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date for financial assets other than those held at fair value through the profit and loss.
Financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading and those designated at fair value through the profit and loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within a year of the balance sheet date.
Receivables Receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a third party with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included 111 Financial statements Company Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 1.6 Financial investments continued in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than a year after the balance sheet date: these are classified as non-current assets.
Receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the reporting date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through the profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Financial assets not carried at fair value through the profit and loss are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains and losses both realised and unrealised arising from changes in the value of financial assets held at fair value through the profit and loss are included in the profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the profit and loss as gains and losses from investment securities.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active or for unlisted securities, the Company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuers specific circumstances.
The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the profit and loss is removed from equity and recognised in the profit and loss.
Impairment losses recognised on these instruments are not reversed through the profit and loss if the fair value of the instrument increases in a later period.
1.7 Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.8 Pensions The Company is a member of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme but is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the Companys profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
The Company also operates an unfunded pension plan to cover the costs of former Directors and other senior employees pension entitlements.
Provision is made in the Companys financial statements for the expected costs of meeting the associated liabilities.
Costs in respect of the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as contributions become payable.
1.9 Share-based compensation The Company operates various equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in estimates about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become 112 exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original non-market estimates, if any, in the profit and loss, and a corresponding adjustments to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The expense recognised in the Company relates only to the Company employees.
Share-based expenses relating to grants of the Companys equity made to employees of subsidiary companies are recognised in the profit and loss of the subsidiary and the parent company does not record any entries on the award of these options except when the options are exercised.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium when the options are exercised.
Where continuing employees withdraw from share-based compensation plans the remaining charge is recognised immediately.
1.10 Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Convertible bonds issued by the Company are initially recognised at fair value.
The bond is separated into a liability and equity component.
The liability component is recognised at amortised cost.
The equity component represents the residual of the fair value of the bond less the liability.
The liability portion is subsequently measured on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bond.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date see note 10.
1.11 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is determined using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the profit and loss.
1.12 Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are re-measured to fair value at each reporting date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Company designates derivatives as either: hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the profit and loss in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, network assets or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the profit and loss.
Derivatives that are not designated and effective hedging instruments Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated as or are not effective hedging instruments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss.
113 Financial statements Company Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 1.13 Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded derivatives or trading and available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is the current bid price.
The appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Company uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the reporting date.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar financial instruments.
Discounted cash flows are used to determine the fair value for the majority of remaining financial instruments.
1.14 Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and purchase of own shares by the Company The financial statements of the Company include the assets and related liabilities of the Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust, which holds shares for the Groups ESOP.
Under the requirements of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, the shares held by the Trust are stated at cost and deducted from shareholders funds.
Shares purchased by the Company are held as treasury shares at cost and deducted from shareholders funds until they are cancelled, sold for cash or transferred out of treasury pursuant to an employees share scheme.
Treasury shares do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be paid on these shares.

The consideration was made up of 675 million debt repayment, 15 million to acquire the share capital of Chelys Limited and 15 million of direct costs incurred to acquire Energis.
As part of the Energis acquisition in November 2005, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration of between nil and a maximum of 80 million.
The amount of contingent consideration is tied to the Companys share price and may be satisfied, at the Companys option, in either cash or shares of the Company.
Payments will be based on a ratio of 1.25 million for every one penny by which the maximum three month volume weighted average Cable & Wireless share price in the third year following completion exceeds the reference price of 135 pence.
Any payments would begin in March 2008, would be payable once a month until December 2008 and will be based upon Cable & Wireless volume weighted average share price for the three months prior to any relevant payment date.
On 11 December 2005, the entire shareholding in Chelys Limited was sold to another Group company at no gain or loss.
However, liability for the contingent consideration still remains with the Company.
At 31 March 2007, an additional 37 million consideration was recognised reflecting the present value of the contingent consideration estimated to be payable by the Company.

It is considered remote that the requirement to actually repay the loans within one year would be exercised.
The comparative has been adjusted in order to be consistent.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit borrowing up to two and a half times the capital and reserves of the Group.
There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of creditors at 31 March 2007.

Each bond entitles the holder to convert the conversion amount of such bond into fully paid ordinary shares of 25 pence each at an amended rate of 689.655 ordinary shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per ordinary share at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
Full conversion of the bonds would result in an additional 177, 733,748 shares being issued.
The bond also has a take-over protection clause, which adjusts the share conversion price, in the event of a change of control.
Also, after 16 July 2007, if Cable & Wireless share price exceeds 1.885 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days, Cable & Wireless has the right to give not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days notice that it will redeem all unconverted bonds still outstanding on a given date at par plus accrued interest.
If the bonds have not been converted, purchased and cancelled or redeemed by 16 July 2010 they will be redeemed at par on that date.
118 The finance costs charged in the profit and loss accounts comprise the aggregate of the interest expense and the proportion of issue costs that relate to the financial year.
The convertible bond is recognised on the balance sheet as follows: m Face value of convertible bond issued on 16 July 2003 258 Issue costs 6 Equity conversion component on initial recognition 75 Previous years amortisation of the liability component 15 Liability component on 1 April 2005 192 Interest expense 20 Interest paid 10 Liability component on 1 April 2006 202 Interest expense 21 Interest paid 10 Liability component at 31 March 2007 213 Interest expense on the bond is calculated on the effective yield basis by applying the effective interest rate 10.7% for an equivalent non-convertible bond to the liability component of the convertible bond.

122 17 Pension scheme The Company is a member of a Group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the scheme has been accounted for in these financial statements as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 March 2007 by a qualified external independent actuary.
The contribution for the year was 10.5 million 2005 06 110.8 million.
It has been agreed that an employer contribution rate of 22.3% 2005 06 22.3% of pensionable pay will apply from 1 April 2006.
Further details of the scheme are set out in note 33 of the consolidated accounts.
The Company also operates unfunded pension plans to cover the costs of former Directors and other senior employees pension entitlements.
Provision is made in the Companys financial statements for the expected costs of meeting the associated liabilities and is disclosed as the retirement benefit obligation on the Companys balance sheet.
The major assumptions used in this valuation at the end of the year were: 2006 07 2005 06 % % Inflation assumption 3.0 2.8 Rate of increase in salaries 3.5 3.3 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.2 or 3.0 2.8 or 3.0 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.3 4.9 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
Scheme assets and liabilities The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Unfunded Unfunded Funded Funded value value value value 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m At 31 March Equities 1,115 997 Bonds and gilts 777 715 Property 167 133 Cash 25 137 Total market value of assets 2,084 1,982 Present value of scheme liabilities 22 23 2,030 2,059 Deficit surplus in the scheme pension liability asset 22 23 54 77 Related deferred tax liability asset Net pension liability asset 22 23 54 77 123 Financial statements Company Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 17 Pension scheme continued Long term rate of return 2006 07 2005 06 % % Equities 7.8 7.5 Bonds and gilts 5.0 4.5 Property 6.5 6.0 Cash 4.5 4.3 Movement in deficit during the year Unfunded Unfunded Funded Funded 2006 07 2005 06 2006 07 2005 06 m m m m Deficit in scheme at beginning of year 23 20 77 160 Current service cost 14 17 Contributions paid 1 11 111 Curtailment surplus 4 Other finance cost income 1 19 11 Actuarial loss gain 2 111 22 Deficit surplus in the scheme at the end of the year 22 23 54 77 18 Related party transactions Under FRS 8 Related party disclosures, the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose transactions with entities that are part of the Cable & Wireless Group, or investees of the Group qualifying as related parties, as all of the Companys voting rights are controlled within the Group.

4 The Company holds an economic interest of 55% in Monaco Telecom via a subsidiary.
The list above only includes those companies whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affect the figures shown in the financial statements.
On 18 June 2004 Cable & Wireless acquired 55% of Monaco Telecom, a Monaco-based telecommunication service provider, from Vivendi Universal.
Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & Wireless transferred legal ownership of 6% of the shares of Monaco Telecom to an unrelated third party.
Cable & Wireless contractually retained voting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement.
In addition, the 6% interest is subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and economic rights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless.
Cable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders agreement with the Principality of Monaco, which contains, among other provisions, a prohibition on either Cable & Wireless or the Principality subject to certain limited exceptions selling their shares in Monaco Telecom for five years, mutual pre-emption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favour of the Principality.
The Principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless at certain times after 1 January 2008.
The exercise price under the put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco Telecom.
Full details of all subsidiary undertakings, associates, joint ventures and trade investments will be attached to the Companys Annual Return, to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in England and Wales.

125 Financial statements Company Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 22 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Guarantees given by the Company at the end of the financial year for which no provision has been made in the financial statements are as follows: 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 m m Trading guarantees 117 184 Other guarantees 204 310 Total guarantees 321 494 Trading guarantees principally comprise performance bonds or contracts issued in the normal course of business, guaranteeing the Group company will meet its obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The guarantees also enable the customer to obtain repayment of any advance payment in the event of the relevant subsidiary failing to carry out its contractual obligations in full.
Some of these guarantees are uncapped.
Other guarantees comprise guarantees for financial obligations of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings in respect of borrowings, leases and letters of credit.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee.
The nature of contracts includes projects, service level agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials.
The guarantees contain a clause that they will be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the contract.
Whilst Pender, the Groups former insurance operation, ceased to underwrite new business from April 2003 it has in the past written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies, which have also given rise to uncertainties and potential disputes with reinsurers.
Detail of these insurance claims and potential claims are not disclosed as such disclosure may be prejudicial to the outcome of such claims.
Other matters In addition the Company has, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.
In relation to the sale of CWC ConsumerCo in May 2000, the Company gave a number of standard warranties and indemnities.
There is no time limit or cap that applies generally, the Company also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements.
Some of these agreements do not contain liability caps.
The principal guarantee by the Company is for the 200 million 2019 bond issued by Cable & Wireless International Finance BV.
Whilst the Company ceased participation in the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund in 1999, it may be liable for future contributions to fund a portion of any future funding deficits.
Currently, the amount of these potential liabilities cannot be quantified.
