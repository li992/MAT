64 Notes to the Financial Statements For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Home Retail Group plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of Home Retail Group the Group, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England under the Companies Act 1985 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Home Retail Group is a home and general merchandise retailer.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 2 May 2007.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of Home Retail Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
They also comply with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
BASIS OF PREPARATION Previously, Home Retail Group then ARG prepared its financial information for the financial year for the 12 months to 31 March except for the results of Homebase Limited which were included for the 12 months to 28 or 29 February each year, with adjustments to reflect the balance sheet movements in cash to the end of March.
This was done to facilitate comparability of the income statement by avoiding the distortions that would arise relating to changes in the timing of Easter.
In order to align the year-end across the Group, the Board of Directors have decided to amend the Groups financial year to a 52-week period ending on the Saturday closest to the end of February.
Therefore, following the change of accounting reference date, the audited accounts have been prepared for the short-period ended 3 March 2007 with comparatives for the 12 months to 31 March 2006.
Unless otherwise stated, references to 2007 within the notes to the financial statements are for the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007, in the case of balance sheet notes, as at 3 March 2007 with comparatives at 31 March 2006.
The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historic cost basis modified for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, and are in line with the listing particulars.
Group reorganisation Home Retail Group demerged from its parent company, GUS plc, with effect from 10 October 2006.
Shares in Home Retail Group were admitted to the Official List of the Financial Services Authority and to trading on the London Stock Exchanges main market for listed securities on 11 October 2006.
All Home Retail Group companies which were owned by GUS plc prior to demerger were transferred under the new ultimate parent company, Home Retail Group plc, prior to 11 October 2006.
The introduction of this new ultimate holding company constitutes a group reconstruction and has been accounted for using merger accounting principles.
Therefore, although the Group reorganisation did not become effective until 10 October 2006, these consolidated financial statements of Home Retail Group are presented as if the current Group structure had always been in place.
In the prospectus, funding balances between the Group and GUS plc which were interest bearing and had the characteristics of debt, were presented as debt in the balance sheet, with the interest taken to the income statement.
Prior to demerger, the net funding balances were reduced by 240.0m by means of a capitalisation and the financial statements reflect this capitalisation as having taken place just prior to 31 March 2005.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the ultimate parent company Home Retail Group plc, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and the Groups share of its interests in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Groups consolidation.
Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity whose operating and financing policies are controlled by Home Retail Group plc.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control was transferred to Home Retail Group.
Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date that Home Retail Group no longer has control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Home Retail Group companies have been eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other interested parties under a contractual agreement.
Associates are entities over which Home Retail Group has significant influence but not control.
The equity method is used to account for investments in joint ventures and associates and investments are initially recognised at cost.
65 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 Home Retail Groups share of net assets of its joint ventures and associates are included on the Group balance sheet.
Home Retail Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post acquisition profits or losses are recognised in its income statement.
The cumulative post acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying value of the investment.
The carrying amount of an investment in a joint venture or associate is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount to its carrying amount whenever there is an indication that the investment may be impaired.
Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of business acquisitions is the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, equity instruments issued by the acquirer and any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Intangible assets are recognised if they meet the definition of an intangible asset contained in IAS 38 and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Changes in accounting standards A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations are effective for the short period ended 3 March 2007, but have had no material impact on the results or the financial position of the Group.
The impact of IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, has been reflected through both the current period and prior year within Notes 8 and 31.
At the balance sheet date a number of IFRSs and IFRIC interpretations were in issue but not yet effective.
The Group has not earlyadopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures and the Capital disclosure amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements, which are applicable for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The Group has not early-adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
These standards will be fully considered in due course.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods where appropriate.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Taxes The Group is subject to taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.
Pension benefits The present value of the defined benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligations and net pension costs include the expected long-term rate of return on the relevant plan assets and the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions may impact the amounts disclosed in the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The expected return on plan assets is calculated by reference to the plan investments at the year-end and is a weighted average of the expected returns on each main asset type based on market yields available on these asset types at the year-end.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the defined benefit obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the market yields of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for defined benefit obligations and pension costs are based in part on market conditions at the relevant year ends and additional information is disclosed in Note 25.
HOME RETAIL GROUP Annual Report 07 Notes to the Financial Statements 66 Notes to the F Notes to the Financial Statements inancial Statements continued F For the shor or the short per t period 1 iod 1 A Ap pr ril 2006 to 3 Mar il 2006 to 3 Marc ch h 2007 2007 Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs at the level of each business segment.
The recoverable amount of each of the business segments is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculation are those regarding discount rates, growth rates as well as expected changes to costs and selling prices in the period.
Management have estimated the discount rate taking account of the specific risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future change in the markets.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management looking forward up to five years.
Cash flows are extrapolated using estimated growth rates beyond the budget period.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are: a real growth rate of 2.25% has been used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period: and a post tax discount rate of 7% applied to the cash flow projections which equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 10%.
Provisions Provisions have been estimated for onerous leases, self insurance and other liabilities.
These provisions represent the best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as trading conditions at a particular store or the incidence of insurance claims against the Group.
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which the revision is made.
Impairment of assets Assets are subject to impairment reviews whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
Assets are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows from the asset at an appropriate discount rate for the risks associated with that asset.
This includes estimates of both the expected cash flows and an appropriate discount rate which use managements assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the asset.
Differences between expectations and the actual cash flows will result in differences in the level of impairment required.
Inventory provisions Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value which requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to customers in the future.
Any difference between the expected and the actual sales price achieved will be accounted for in the period in which the sale is made.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, discounts and returns.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue on goods to be delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery.
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods being sold at a discount to the standard retail price.
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts.
Commissions receivable on the sale of services for which the Group acts as agent are included within revenue.
A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold during the year which will be returned and refunded after the year-end.
Interest income Interest income on customer store card accounts and loans is recognised as revenue on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method.
When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate, and continues to recognise the unwinding of the discount as interest income.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial information is presented in sterling, which is the Groups functional and presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash flow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary items are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
67 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 Group companies The results and financial position of overseas Home Retail Group entities are translated into sterling as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity.
Tax charges and credits attributable to those exchange differences are taken directly to equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares granted is recognised as an expense after taking into account the Groups best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.
The Group revisits the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date.
Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimate.
Expenses are incurred over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo model and closing market price is most appropriate to the award.
Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revisited for actual performance.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at cost being the purchase price and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Depreciation is charged on a straight line basis as follows: freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years: leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease: plant, vehicles and equipment are depreciated over two to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset: equipment on hire or lease is depreciated over the period of the lease: and land is not depreciated.
Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identifiable net assets of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture acquired at the date of acquisition.
Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested annually for impairment.
An impairment charge is recognised where the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its receivable amount, being the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations are performed using cash flow projections discounted at a rate taking account of the specific risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria are satisfied.
These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate resources to complete the development and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
The cost of other intangible assets with finite useful economic lives is amortised over that period.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
If impaired, they are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over three to five years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
HOME RETAIL GROUP Annual Report 07 Notes to the Financial Statements 68 Notes to the F Notes to the Financial Statements inancial Statements continued F For the shor or the short per t period 1 iod 1 A Ap pr ril 2006 to 3 Mar il 2006 to 3 Marc ch h 2007 2007 Financial instruments The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value, loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position at every reporting date.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement Financial assets and liabilities are those designated at fair value through the income statement.
Derivatives are generally designated as hedges.
Items in this category are classified as current assets or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are shown in the Group statement of recognised income and expense.
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
Changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised in the income statement within finance costs.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
Cash flow hedges The cash flow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposures of the future purchases of inventory.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion would be recognised immediately in the income statement.
The hedged cash flow is expected to occur up to one year into the future and will be transferred to the consolidated income statement via inventory carrying value as applicable.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current offer price.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
The gross margin from the sale of a retail product on extended credit terms is recognised at the time of the sale of the retail product.
The finance charges relating to the sale of financial services are included in the income statement as and when instalments are received.
Income under instalment agreements is credited to the income statement using the effective interest method.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the balance sheet, with the cost of unrecoverable trade receivables recognised in the income statement immediately.
69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost bases in use within the Group are general retail goods valued on a standard cost or weighted average basis which approximates to actual cost.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Costs of inventory include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges relating to their purchase.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Borrowings and borrowing costs All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value and other borrowing costs is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.
However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain.
Provisions are made for onerous lease contracts for stores that have closed or where a decision to close has been announced, and for those stores where the projected future trading revenue is insufficient to cover the lower of exit cost or value-in-use.
Leases Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the life of the lease.
Employee benefits The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
HOME RETAIL GROUP Annual Report 07 Notes to the Financial Statements 70 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the vesting period.
Catalogue costs Costs incurred during the production of the Groups catalogues are deferred on the balance sheet net of any associated advertising revenue and marketing support until the catalogue is launched, at which point the net deferred cost is charged to the income statement.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year end are not recognised in the Financial Statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Dividends are recognised in the Financial Statements when they are paid.
Insurance Certain of the Groups insurances are handled by the Groups captive insurance company, Global Guernsey Limited, which accounts for all insurance business on an annual basis and the net consolidated result is dealt with as part of the operating costs in these accounts.
Insurance premiums in respect of insurance placed with third parties and re-insurance premiums in respect of risks not retained by the Groups captive insurance company are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Non-GAAP financial information Exceptional items Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items within their relevant income statement line.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of underlying performance of the Group.
Examples of items which may be recorded as exceptional items are impairment charges, restructuring costs and the profits losses on the disposal of businesses.
Benchmark PBT The Group uses the term benchmark profit before tax PBT as a measure which is not formally recognised under IFRS.
Benchmark PBT is defined as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, store impairment charges, exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements, financing impact on retirement benefit balances, and one-off demerger incentive costs.
This measure is considered useful in that it provides investors with an alternative means to evaluate the underlying performance of the Groups operations.
Net debt The Group uses the term net debt which is considered useful in that it provides the Groups aggregate net indebtedness to banks and other financial institutions together with debt-like liabilities, notably property leases.
FOREIGN CURRENCY The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Average Closing Period to Year to 3 March 31 March 3 March 31 March 2007 2006 2007 2006 US dollar 1.90 1.79 1.94 1.74 Euro 1.48 1.46 1.48 1.44 Assets and liabilities of overseas undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated into sterling at average rates of exchange.

This is in line with the current management structure, which reflects the different risks associated with the different businesses.
The Group is organised into three main business segments:Argos, Homebase and Financial Services together with Central Activities.
Revenue earned from sales is disclosed by origin and is not materially different from revenue by destination.

ACQUISITIONS There have been no acquisitions during the short period to 3 March 2007.
On 21 July 2005, Argos acquired the Index brand and 33 former Index stores from Littlewoods Limited for a total consideration of 45m including acquisition costs of 1m.
At acquisition, the business had a book value of assets of 6m, against which no fair value was attributed.
In addition, the intangible assets were determined to have negligible value, consequently goodwill of 45m was generated on the transaction.
This goodwill represents the synergies, assembled workforce and future growth potential of the business acquired.

The majority of this provision is expected to be utilised over the period to 2011.
The fine imposed by the Competition Appeal Tribunal was paid during the period.
Provision is made at the year end for the estimated costs of claims incurred by Home Retail Groups captive insurance company but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the costs of claims that have arisen but have not yet been reported to Home Retail Group.

POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS Home Retail Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which Home Retail Group pays contributions into an independently administered fund.
Home Retail Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the period.
Pension arrangements for UK employees are operated principally through a defined benefit scheme the Argos Scheme and a defined contribution scheme the GUS Defined Contribution Scheme, now replaced by the Home Retail Group Defined Contribution Scheme.
In other countries, benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided accordingly.
a Defined Benefit Schemes i The Argos Defined Benefit Scheme The scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and are financed accordingly with assets being held in independently administered funds.
A full actuarial valuation of this scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent, qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method of valuation the current service cost will increase as members approach retirement due to the ageing active membership of the scheme.

The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the present value of the defined benefit obligations were as follows: Argos Defined Benefit Scheme 2007 2006 % % Rate of inflation 3.1 2.9 Rate of increases for salaries 4.4 4.9 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.1 2.9 Discount rate 4.9 4.9 The amount charged to the income statement in respect of unfunded pension arrangements was 0.8m 2006: 2.7m.
The principal financial assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption is increased decreased by 0.1%, the defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 2.6% and the current service cost would decrease increase by 3.8%.
The discount rate is based on market yields on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent currency and term to the defined benefit obligation.
The IAS 19 valuation assumes that mortality will be in line with PA92 Series tables with medium cohort projections for males and females.
An allowance is also made for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy assuming that the probability of death occurring at each age will decrease by 0.25% each year.
Overall, the average expectation of life on retirement in normal health is assumed to be: 21.3 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 65 2006: 18.9 24.2 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 65 2006: 22.0 22.2 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 50 2006: 19.6 25.0 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 50 2006: 22.9 vii The assets of Home Retail Groups defined benefit schemes and the expected rates of return are summarised as follows: 2007 2006 Expected Expected Percentage long-term Percentage long-term Fair of scheme rate of Fair of scheme rate of value assets return value assets return m % %pa m % %pa Market value of schemes assets: Equities 448.6 70 7.9 428.2 70 7.9 Fixed interest securities 182.0 29 4.4 176.1 29 4.5 Other 6.7 1 4.9 0.3 1 3.7 637.3 100 6.9 604.6 100 6.9 The overall expected rate of return on plan assets is the weighted average of the best estimate of the individual asset categories and their inherent expected rates of return.

Home Retail Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks and Home Retail Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on Home Retail Groups performance.
a Market risk Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage their foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with external banks.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts.
For segment reporting purposes, each subsidiary designates contracts with Group Treasury as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, as appropriate.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at Group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The cash flow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposure of future purchases of inventory.
The Group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not hedged.
87 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 b Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of financial services products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
c Liquidity risk Home Retail Group manages its cash and committed bank borrowing facilities to maintain liquidity and funding flexibility.
d Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk Whilst the Group has 24.2m 2006: 54.7m of gross instalment receivable balances on fixed interest rates, with the remainder on floating rates, the Groups income and operating cash flows are still considered to be substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals mainly quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

116 plc on 30 June 2006 as part of the scheme of arrangement.
On incorporation, the Companys authorised share capital was 1,000,050,000 divided into 1,000,000,000 ordinary shares of 1 each and two redeemable preference shares of 25,000 each.
Of such shares, two ordinary shares were taken by the subscribers to the memorandum of association, and were paid up in full in cash.
The preference shares were allotted for cash and were paid up as to 30% by virtue of the holder giving an understanding to pay up each share to such amount pursuant to section 738 2 of the Companies Act 1985 the Act.
On 26 February 2007, these shares were redeemed and pursuant to Article 8.2.
5 of the Articles, the nominal amount of such Redeemable Preference Share comprised in the authorised share capital was sub-divided and converted into ordinary shares of 10p each.
On 11 September 2006 at an Extraordinary General Meeting, the existing ordinary shares of 1 each were subdivided into 100 ordinary shares of 1p each.
Subsequently, a further 460 ordinary shares of 1p each were issued in aggregate and fully subscribed for equivalent in cash by the subscribers to the memorandum of association.
The authorised share capital of the Company was increased to 6,600,050,000 by the creation of 560,000,000,000 ordinary shares of 1p each.
Finally, all the issued and ordinary shares of 1p each were consolidated into ordinary shares of 330p each.
On 10 October 2006, the Company issued 877,444,999 ordinary shares of 330p to the public shareholders of Experian Group Ltd in return for the receipt of shares in Home Retail Group UK Ltd and to satisfy the obligations of Experian Group Ltd to its public shareholders pursuant to the reduction of capital of Experian Group Ltd, under the scheme of arrangement.
As Home Retail Group plc was not a subsidiary of Experian Group Ltd, section 131 of the Act applied to the transaction and no recognition of share premium was necessary.
On 12 October 2006, the nominal amount of the issued ordinary shares was reduced from 330p to 10p by way of a court-approved capital reduction scheme in accordance with section 135 of the Act.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS a Impact on the Groups share-based payment schemes from the demerger A number of Home Retail Group plc employees participated in old GUS plc share-based payment schemes.
As part of the demerger, some of these schemes had early vesting with vesting occurring prior to completion of the demerger, while others were modified by rolling them over to become Home Retail Group plc share-based payment schemes.
Additionally, a number of new schemes have been established by Home Retail Group plc after the demerger from GUS plc including a number of schemes specifically related to the demerger Demerger Incentive Schemes.
Specifically, all Executive Share Option Schemes in operation following the demerger from GUS plc on 11 October 2006 have been rolled over from a GUS plc share option arrangement to a Home Retail Group plc arrangement.
Furthermore, certain share grant schemes namely Co-investment and Performance Share Plan which originally operated as GUS share grant schemes, have been rolled over as Home Retail Group plc share grant schemes.
Under IFRS 2, these changes have been treated as modifications to the schemes and hence revalued as at the demerger date.
During the period of the demerger from GUS plc, Home Retail Group plc employees within the save as you earn SAYE scheme had the option of vesting at the demerger date or to continue contributing to the scheme until January 2007.
Comparative information is included in the financial statements to assist users in understanding trends and developments from the previous accounting period.
Due to the demerger, comparative information is not considered meaningful for all information provided in the share-based payment disclosure note.
This is the case for some information relating directly to Home Retail Group plc shares in the current period and GUS plc shares in the comparative period, e. g. key assumptions used for valuing share options and grants such as the share price on grant date, exercise price and expected volatility.
Such information would not be comparable as it would compare assumptions relating to two different shares, i. e. Home Retail Group plc and GUS plc shares respectively.
As management believes that providing comparative information in these areas is likely to create confusion instead of assisting users, information has been omitted as allowed under IFRS.
Where comparative information has been omitted, this has been clearly indicated.

The accelerated vesting charge due to early vesting has been classified as an exceptional item in line with Home Retail Group plcs accounting policies.
The cost of demerger incentive schemes of 5.1m, together with national insurance costs of 0.7m, in total 5.8m, are excluded from benchmark profit before tax.
c Options in respect of the ordinary shares of the Company i Summary of arrangements During the year ended 3 March 2007, Home Retail Group plc had two share option arrangements for its employees.
Details of these share option arrangements are as follows: Arrangements The 1998 approved and non-approved Savings related share executive share option schemes option schemes Nature Grant of options modified scheme Save as you earn scheme Vesting conditions Service period 3 years 3 or 5 years 1 Performance other EPS growth performance condition Saving obligation over the vesting period Expected outcome of meeting Condition is satisfied n a performance criteria at grant date Maximum term 10 years 3.5 or 5.5 years Method of settlement Share distribution Share distribution Expected departures at grant date 5% 3 years 30% 5 years 50% Option exercise price calculation Market price over the 3 dealing days preceding grant 20% discount to market price over the 3 dealing days preceding grant 1 The performance condition for the Executive Share Option Scheme requires EPS compound annual growth to exceed compound annual retail price inflation by 4% per annum over a continuous three-year period.
This is not a market-based performance condition as defined by IFRS 2.
91 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the short period 1 April 2006 to 3 March 2007 ii Information relating to option valuation techniques The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to determine an appropriate value of the option grants.
Where a scheme has been modified, a revaluation is performed at the date of modification.
Any increase in fair value is charged to the income statement over the remaining life of the scheme.
The estimated fair values and inputs into the option pricing model are as follows: The 1998 Approved and Non-Approved Executive Share Arrangements Option Schemes Home Retail GUS plc Weighted average: Group Fair value 0.97 2.06 Share price on grant date 4.17 9.35 Exercise price 3.88 9.26 Expected volatility 26.6% 29.4% Expected dividend yield 3.0% 3.5% Risk free interest rate 4.8% 4.7% Expected option life to exercise 4 years 4 years Expected volatility for Home Retail Group calculated as an average over the expected life.
As no implied or historical volatility exists for Home Retail Group, an average of volatilities has been calculated from comparator companies.
Expected volatility for GUS plc calculated as an average over the expected life with an assumption made for volatility in each year of the expected life.
Volatility in the first year is assumed to be the same as implied volatility on grant date.
Volatility for year 4 and beyond is assumed to remain at the long run 10 year observed historic volatility.
Linear interpolation is assumed for years 2 and 3. iii Reconciliation of movement in the number of share options Weighted Number of average options exercise price Outstanding at beginning of year GUS shares 12,160,041 6.87 New grants 1,829,272 9.26 Forfeitures 1,044,528 6.60 Exercised options 4,744,024 5.71 Expired options 206,099 6.21 Transferred from GUS on demerger 555,300 6.96 Outstanding at demerger date GUS shares 8,549,962 7.77 Rollover adjustment to Home Retail Group shares 14,439,212 3.44 Forfeitures 1,209,606 2.93 Exercised options 3,271,348 2.84 Outstanding at end of year Home Retail Group shares 9,958,258 3.70 Exercisable at end of year Home Retail Group shares 445,921 3.19 Comparatives have been excluded as the movements in the prior year refer to GUS plc shares only and would not directly compare to the movements of the current year.

2 The performance share plan and re-investment plan - The total shareholder return performance condition is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2.
Both schemes have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three year period preceding valuation.
The performance share plan valuation was performed during the time when the scheme was operated as a GUS scheme.
The re-investment plan has a fair value award of 51% of the share price at the date of grant.
3 The grant date for the co-investment plan is the start of the financial year in which performance is assessed.
This may be up to one year before the quantity of shares award is determined.
The underlying value of the award is known at grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition.
The value of awarded shares reflects the performance outcome at the date of issue to participants.
ii Information relating to share grant valuation techniques The value of the awards is determined as the observed market closing rate on the date awarded grants are issued to participants.
For the co-investment plan, this occurs after the first year of performance is assessed.
The performance share plans and the re-investment plans market-based performance condition is included in the fair value measurement on grant date and is not revised for actual performance.
Under the share awards, the participants have an entitlement to dividend distributions from issue date until point of vesting.
