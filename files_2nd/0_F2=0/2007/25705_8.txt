During the year the Company reorganised its single class of shares into two classes of shares, Growth shares and Income shares.
Details of the reorganisation are given in note 1 on page 49.
The Total column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Growth pool of assets and the Revenue and Capital columns represent supplementary information.
The Companys accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 have been presented as comparative for the results of the Growth pool because the Growth pool has maintained materially the same economic exposure as if the reorganisation had not been implemented.
The investment objective, investment policy, benchmark and management fee arrangements have remained the same as for the ordinary shares in issue prior to the reorganisation.
