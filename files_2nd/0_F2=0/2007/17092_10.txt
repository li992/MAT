Notes to the consolidated fi Pa ng ae nc h ie aa l d statements A ye t a 1 r M en a d re ch d 2 20 M 07 arch 2007 1 Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC for the year ended 1 March 2007 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 23 April 2007.
Whitbread PLC is a public limited company incorporated and fully domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The significant activities of the Group are described in note 4.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
2 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except when otherwise indicated.
The significant accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of Whitbread PLC and all its subsidiaries, together with the Groups share of the net assets and results of joint ventures and associates incorporated within these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
These are adjusted, where appropriate, to conform to Group accounting policies.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company.
Apart from the acquisition of Whitbread Group PLC by Whitbread PLC in 2000 1, which was accounted for using merger accounting, acquisitions by the Group are accounted for under the acquisition method and any goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated accounts from or up to the date that control passes respectively.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The income statement for the comparative period has been restated to reflect the decision to dispose of the interest in TGI Fridays and the Pizza Hut joint venture, both of which have been classified as discontinued operations.
The segmental note for the comparative period has been restated to reflect the segmental analysis implemented during 2006 7, see note 4 for more details.
Significant accounting policies Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised and represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are carried initially at cost.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
IT software IT software is amortised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, estimated between three and 10 years.
The carrying values are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
Other Other intangible assets are amortised over periods of up to 10 years.
Property, plant and equipment Prior to the 1999 0 financial year, properties were regularly revalued on a cyclical basis.
Since this date the Group policy has been not to revalue its properties and, while previous valuations have been retained, they have not been updated.
As permitted by IFRS 1, the Group has elected to use the UK GAAP revaluations before the date of transition to IFRS as deemed cost at the date of transition.
Fixed assets are stated at cost or deemed cost at transition to IFRS, less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that they are available for use.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold land is not depreciated.
Freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to 50 years.
Plant and equipment is depreciated over three to 30 years.
page 24 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2006 7 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable.
Any impairment in the value of fixed assets is charged to the income statement.
Profits and losses on disposal of fixed assets reflect the difference between net selling price and the carrying amount at the date of disposal and are recognised in the income statement.
Payments made on entering into or acquiring leaseholds that are accounted for as operating leases represent prepaid lease payments.
These are amortised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Impairment The Group assesses assets or Groups of assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
Individual assets are Grouped for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other Groups of assets cash generating units or CGUs.
If such indication of impairment exists or when annual impairment testing for an asset Group is required, the Group makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss.
After such a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
For the purposes of impairment testing all centrally held assets are allocated in line with IAS 36 to CGUs based on managements view of the consumption of the asset.
Any resulting impairment is recorded against the centrally held asset.
Goodwill and intangibles Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to Groups of CGUs at the level management monitor goodwill, which is at brand level.
The Group performs an annual review of its goodwill to ensure that its carrying amount is not greater than its recoverable amount.
In the absence of a comparable recent market transaction that demonstrates that the fair value less costs to sell of goodwill and intangible assets exceeds their carrying amount, the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
An impairment is then made to reduce the carrying amount to the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use.
Property, plant and equipment For the purposes of the impairment review of property, plant and equipment the Group considers CGUs to be all trading outlets.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the greater of net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined with reference to the CGU to which the asset belongs.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement in the administrative and distribution line items.
Consideration is also given where appropriate to the market value of the asset, either from independent sources, or in conjunction with an accepted industry valuation methodology.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is calculated on the basis of first in, first out and net realisable value is the estimated selling price less any costs of disposal.
Provisions Provisions for warranties, onerous contracts and restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The amortisation of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Exceptional items The Group presents on the face of the income statement those items which are separately identified by virtue of their size or incidence so as to allow a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
The Group will include the profit or loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment and impairment in exceptional items.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of initial transactions.
Trading results are translated into the functional currency generally sterling at average rates of exchange for the year.
Day to day transactions in a foreign currency are recorded in the functional currency at an average rate for the month in which those transactions take place, which is used as a reasonable approximation to the actual transaction rate.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge, then translation differences are taken directly to equity.
The differences that arise from translating the results of foreign entities at average rates of exchange, and their assets and liabilities at closing rates, are also dealt with in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
All other currency gains and losses are dealt with in the income statement.
A number of subsidiaries within the Group have a euro functional currency.
These are translated into sterling in the Group accounts.
Balance sheet items are translated at the rate applicable at the balance sheet date.
Transactions reported in the income statement are translated using an average rate for the month in which they occur.
Revenue recognition Generally, revenue is the value of goods and services sold to third parties as part of the Groups trading activities, after deducting discounts and sales-based taxes.
The following is a description of the composition of revenues of the Group: Sale of goods Sale of food and beverages revenue is recognised when food and beverages are sold.
Franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of the Groups brand names.
Revenue is recognised when earned.
Leisure club subscriptions subscriptions are recognised over the period that membership relates to.
Royalties Royalties are recognised as the income is earned.
Rendering of services Owned hotel revenue including the rental of rooms and food and beverage sales from a network of hotels.
Revenue is recognised when rooms are occupied and food and beverage is sold.
Finance revenue Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive the payment is established.
Cash flows are included net of recoverable VAT.
Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease term.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred, except for gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects which, under the allowed alternative treatment, are capitalised until the time that the projects are available for use.
Retirement benefits In respect of defined benefit pension schemes, the obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for any unrecognised past service cost, reduced by the fair value of the scheme assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined benefit plans, the employers portion of the past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within finance costs.
The expected return on plan assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long-term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of plan assets of contributions received and benefits paid during the year.
Curtailments and settlements relating to the Groups defined benefit plan are recognised in the period that the curtailment or settlement occurs.
Payments to defined contribution pension schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
page 26 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2006 7 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions Certain employees and directors of the Group receive equity-settled remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees are measured by reference to the fair value, determined using a stochastic model, at the date at which they are granted.
The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the relevant vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired, and is adjusted to reflect the directors best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Tax The income tax charge represents both the income tax payable, based on profits for the year, and deferred income tax.
Deferred income tax is recognised in full, using the liability method, in respect of all temporary timing differences between the tax base of the Groups assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts, that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date.
No deferred tax is recognised if the temporary timing difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or libility in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is recognised in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary timing differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments which are held by the Group treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue, or cancellation of the Groups own equity instruments.
Investments in joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are established through an interest in a company a jointly controlled entity.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition, investments in joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Financial instruments Other financial assets Investments in available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and including acquisition charges associated with the investment.
After initial recognition available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the investment is disposed of or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Some assets held by the Group are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
On initial recognition these assets are recognised at fair value, subsequent measurement is also at fair value with changes recognised through the interest line in the income statement.
Impairment of financial assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or Group of financial assets is impaired.
Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The discount rate is the original effective rate of interest.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced, with the amount of the loss recognised in administrative costs.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss is recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed in the income statement to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
Assets carried at cost If there is objective evidence that impairment has occurred the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
page 27 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2006 7 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Notes to the consolidated fi Pa ng ae nc h ie aa l d statements A ye t a 1 r M en a d re ch d 2 20 M 07 arch 2007 2 Accounting policies continued Available-for-sale financial assets If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost and its fair value is transferred from equity to the income statement.
Reversals of impairment losses on debt instruments are recognised in the income statement, if the loss can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
Reversals in respect of equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written-off when identified.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received net of any directly associated issue costs.
Borrowings are subsequently recorded at amortised cost, with any difference between the amount initially recorded and the redemption value recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments used by the Group are stated at fair value on initial recognition and at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
Hedge accounting is only used where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and it meets the Groups risk management objective strategy for undertaking the hedge and it is expected to be highly effective.
Gains or losses from remeasuring fair value hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, are recorded in the income statement, together with the corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments attributable to the hedged risk.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the income statement such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
The portion of any gains or losses of cash flow hedges, which meet the conditions for hedge accounting and are determined to be effective hedges, are recognised directly in equity.
The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a firm commitment that is hedged becomes an asset or a liability recognised on the balance sheet, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the transaction that results from a firm commitment that is hedged affects the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, for cash flow hedges, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
Recognition and derecognition of financial instruments The recognition of financial instruments occurs when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The derecognition of a financial instrument takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates Estimation uncertainty impairment of goodwill Key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation, at the balance sheet date have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the CGU and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present values of those cash flows.
The carrying values of goodwill are disclosed in more detail in note 13. page 28 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2006 7 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2 Accounting policies continued Note 15 describes the assumptions used in impairment testing of tangible fixed assets.
Note 35 describes the assumptions used in accounting for retirement benefit obligations.

3 Revenue An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: Restated 2006 7 2005 6 m m Rendering of services 458.5 407.8 Royalties 7.0 5.0 Sale of goods 945.3 1,079.1 Revenue 1,410.8 1,491.9 Finance revenue 2.0 1.2 Total revenue 1,412.8 1,493.1 4 Segment information The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Group has four core areas of operation: Operation Nature of operation Premier Travel Inn Operation of budget hotels.
Restaurants Operation of full service and self service pub restaurants.
Costa Operation of coffee shops.
David Lloyd Leisure Operation of fitness clubs across the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain, providing racquets, health and fitness club facilities and expertise.
Following the recent reorganisation of the Group and business disposals the segments have been changed to reflect the resultant size and shape of the Groups activities.
This has resulted in the renaming of the Pub Restaurants segment to Restaurants and Costa being reported in its own segment.
In addition prior year comparatives have been restated to include TGI Fridays and Pizza Hut as discontinued operations.
Inter-segment revenue is from Costa to the other segments.
Transactions were entered into on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
Included within unallocated operations are those that are managed by a central division.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
The Group materially operates within the UK and as such the secondary format of geographical segments is not presented.

1 During 2005 6 the Board instigated a fundamental reorganisation of all central support functions and the financial impact of this decision has continued into the current period.
In addition the announced disposal of 235 pubs led to a further restructuring during 2006 7 to reflect the resultant shape of the Group.
The costs principally relate to redundancy, closure costs and a pension curtailment credit.
2 During the period 235 trading pubs, together with four sites not yet trading, have been disposed of to Mitchells & Butlers resulting in a profit on disposal after costs of 196.6m.
Contingent deferred consideration of as much as 7.5m may be due to Whitbread in future periods.
This has not been accounted for due to uncertainty regarding whether it will be received.
3 During the year a provision for an onerous contract was released resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account of 13.3m.
In addition, new provisions for warranties on disposals and onerous contracts were created which resulted in a charge to the income statement of 5.1m.
4 As a result of Swallow Hotels Limited going into administration in 2006 we have provided for the deferred consideration on the sale of Swallow branded hotels which occurred during 2003 4.
We continue to pursue the outstanding balance and are liaising with the administrators in thismatter.

On 8 May 2006 the preference and ordinary shares held by Marriott International in Condor 2 were redeemed.
As a result Condor 2 became a wholly owned subsidiary of Whitbread PLC.
Outside of the joint venture, Whitbread retained its investment in a further seven of the original properties which have been sold during the year resulting in a net profit on disposal of 4.7m.
On 12 September 2006 Whitbread sold its 50% investment in Pizza Hut UK Limited to Yum!

After adjustments for debt and other liabilities, 99m in cash was received resulting in a profit on disposal of 68.8m.
Prior periods presented in these financial statements have been restated to reflect its status as a discontinued operation.
On 17 January 2007 Whitbread announced its intention to dispose of its TGI Fridays business for an aggregate price of 70.4m.

The adjusted earnings per share is presented so as to show more clearly the underlying performance of the Group.
Diluted earnings per share is the basic and adjusted basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the weighted average number of options outstanding during the period.

Property, plant and equipment The Group considers each trading outlet to be a cash generating unit CGU and each CGU is reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.
In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Group estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model.
The future cash flows are based on assumptions from the business plans and cover a five year period.
Cashflows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate 2005 6: 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate employed is the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital before tax and reflects the relevant risks of the assets being tested for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill acquired through business combinations is allocated to groups of CGUs at brand level, being the level at which management monitor goodwill.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
This is calculated using the five year business plans approved by senior management.
Cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate 2005 6: 2.5%.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections are 9% 2005 6: 9%.
The resultant impairment review required no impairment of the Premier Travel Inn goodwill carrying value of 60.5m.

25 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, debentures, cash and short-term deposits.
The Groups financial instrument policies can be found in the accounting policies in note 2.
The board agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt obligations.
Interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors are used to achieve the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups policy is to fix or cap between 35% and 65% of projected net interest cost over the next 15 years, which is beyond the life of the Groups existing revolving credit facilities.
This policy reduces the Groups exposure to the consequences of interest rate fluctuations.
In addition the Group swaps fixed rate debt into floating rates to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment.
Overall the Group maintains a ratio of fixed rate debt as a proportion of total debt of between 35% to 65%.
At the year end, 566.3m 58% of Group net sterling debt was fixed for an average of 6.4 years, using fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps.
The average rate of interest on this fixed rate sterling debt was 5.8%.
Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end, a 1% change in interest rates would affect costs by approximately 4.0m.
Liquidity risk The Group mitigates liquidity risk by managing cash generations of its operations combined with bank borrowings and long-term debt.
In its funding strategy the Groups objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank loans and debentures Excess cash used in managing liquidity is placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities fixed at no more than three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing on the money markets.
Credit risk There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
This is minimised by dealing with counterparties with high credit ratings.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, which have been estimated by management based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date which may indicate that a provision is required.
The Groups credit risk on liquid funds and derivatives is limited because the Group only maintains liquid funds, and only enters into derivative transactions, with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
The Group also spreads liquid assets over a number of counterparties.
page 46 Whitbread PLC Directors Report and Accounts 2006 7 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 26 Financial instruments Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value of loan capital and derivative instruments is calculated by discounting all future cash flows by the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.

There are no other material monetary assets and liabilities which are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the entity owning them.
Exchange gains and losses on currency funding for overseas net investments are dealt with in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
27 Derivative financial instruments Hedges Cash flow hedges At 1 March 2007, the Group had interest rate swaps in place to swap a notional amount of 490m 2006: 140m whereby it receives a variable interest rate based on LIBOR on the notional amount and pays fixed rates of between 5.145% and 7.375% 2006: 5.425% and 7.375%.
The swaps are being used to hedge the exposure to changes in future cash flows from variable rate debt.
Cash flow hedges are expected to impact on the income statement over the life of the hedges in place as follows: Floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps: m Maturity: July 2008 0.8 February 2009 January 2012 0.4 December 2012 0.1 February 2017 1.5 February 2022 3.7 4.9 The swaps with maturities beyond the life of the current revolving credit facilities 2012 are in place to hedge against the core level of debt the Group will hold.
Fair value hedges The Group has derivatives to hedge interest rate risk which swap the fixed interest rate of 292.4m nominal value of the 11.625% debenture stock for variable rates until January 2011, and the 8.125% debenture stock for variable rates until December 2021.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities Included in loans at 1 March 2007 is a borrowing of 63.2m 94m 2006: 69.3m 101m, which has been designated as a hedge of the net investments in the European subsidiaries and is being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation on the net investment in subsidiaries when these hedges are effective.

34 Share-based payment plans Long-Term Incentive Plan and uplift awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.
At the 2004 AGM shareholder approval was granted to replace the long-term incentive plan LTIP with an uplift awards plan.
The uplift plan awards shares to directors and senior executives of the Group.
Vesting of shares under the scheme will depend on continued employment and meeting total shareholder return TSR performance targets over a three year period.
Details of the performance targets for the LTIP and the uplift awards scheme can be seen in the remuneration policy on pages 8 to 11.
The options are settled in equity once exercised.
Movements in the number of share options and the related weighted average exercise prices WAEP are as follows: 2007 2006 WAEP WAEP Options per share Options per share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 180,079 8.16 477,477 6.23 Granted during the year 110,325 10.77 76,926 9.04 Exercised during the year 144,240 6.36 Expired during the year 48,507 9.60 230,084 5.58 Outstanding at the end of the year 241,897 9.06 180,079 8.16 Exercisable at the end of the year Deferred equity awards Awards are made under the Whitbread Leadership Group Incentive Scheme implemented during 2004 5.

No changes will be made to options already granted.
An earnings per share based performance condition will apply to any such options, and to the extent that the performance is not satisfied after three years, the option shall lapse, i. e. no opportunity to retest performance will be allowed.
This will be the case for the options granted in 2004 and 2005, for which the performance target will require earnings per share growth of RPI plus 12% over the three year performance period.
For options granted between June 2000 and June 2003 the performance conditions require the companys adjusted earnings per share to exceed RPI plus 4% per annum measured over any three consecutive years out of the 10 year performance period starting from June 2000 and ending June 2013 depending on when the options were granted.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
The weighted average contractual life for the share options outstanding as at 1 March 2007 is between 5 and 6 years and are exercisable at prices between 4.31 and 11.21.
Employee share scheme The employee share save scheme is open to employees with the required minimum period of service and provides for a purchase price equal to the market price on the date of grant, less a 20% discount.
The shares can be purchased over the six month period following the 3rd or 5th anniversary of the commencement date, depending on the length chosen by the employee.

The risk free rate is the rate of interest obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The expected dividend yield is calculated on the basis of publicly available information at the time of the grant date which in most cases is the historic dividend yield.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust ESOP The company funds an ESOP to enable it to acquire and hold shares for the LTIP and executive share option schemes.
The ESOP currently holds 0.8m shares.
All dividends on the shares in the ESOP are waived by the Trustee.
35 Retirement benefits Defined contribution schemes The Group operated a defined contribution pension scheme which closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Members of the scheme are contracted out of the State Second Pension.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
Contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
The Group contributes a specified percentage of earnings for members of the above defined contribution schemes, and thereafter has no further obligations in relation to the schemes.
The total cost charged to income in relation to defined contribution schemes in the year was 1.9m 2005 6: 1.7m.
At the year-end 936 employees were active members of the scheme, which also had 6,333 deferred members.

The scheme is funded and contributions by both employees and Group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
At the year end 1,574 employees were active members of the scheme, which also had 28,347 deferred pensioners and 15,339 pensions in payment.
The pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with the actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2005.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
This agreement was updated in October 2005.
Under the agreement, the company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements, up to a value of 300m.
As a consequence of the agreement, during the year ended 1 March 2007, ordinary contributions of 50m related to past service and 7.2m for future service, plus 50m of special contributions were paid by Whitbread Group PLC into the Fund.
The Group expects to make special contributions of a further 140m over the next three years including 50m during the financial years 2007 8 and 2008 9 and 20m during each of the financial years 2009 10 and 2010 11.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the most recent valuations of the UK schemes to 1 March 2007 for IAS 19 purposes were: At At 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5% 4.2% Pre April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.0% 2.6% Post April 2006 rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.3% Discount rate 5.2% 4.8% Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.7% The average life expectancies for members aged 65 are set out below.
The column labelled experience is the life expectancy based on the mortality rates experienced by the Fund pensioners over the intervaluation period.
The current pensioner and future pensioner columns show the allowance for future improvements in life expectancy made in the valuation: Current Future Experience pensioner pensioner years years years Male non-retail 16.6 17.8 20.0 Male retail 15.4 16.5 18.8 Female non-retail 19.4 20.6 22.7 Female retail 18.0 19.2 21.3 The mortality assumptions above are derived from the Funds measured experience of mortality rates over many years, which are generally higher than in other pension schemes, influenced by the Groups pubs and brewing heritage.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 3.3% per annum above inflation.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 8 years.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2006 7 2005 6 m m Current service cost 7.5 9.5 Past service cost 1.5 Curtailments 1.0 5.5 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 5.0 4.0 Expected return on scheme assets 73.0 65.5 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 73.5 72.5 Other finance costs note 8 0.5 7.0 The net finance cost is reported net within interest expense.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity of 366m is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of these pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statements of recognised income and expense before 4 March 2004.
