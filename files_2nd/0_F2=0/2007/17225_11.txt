47 Notes to the financial statements The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, except for share-based payment charges and derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value.
The Groups accounting policies are set out below and have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated accounts.
No alterations were made to the accounting policies as a result of considering all amendments to IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations that became effective during the financial period as these were considered to be immaterial to the Groups operations or were not relevant.
The Group had previously adopted early the amendment to IAS19 Employee Benefits permitting recognition of actuarial gains and losses immediately in equity.
New IFRS and amendments to IAS and interpretations not applied There are a number of standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board that are effective for financial statements after this reporting period.
The following have not been adopted by the Group: Effective date International Financial Reporting Standards on or after IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Capital disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 The application of these standards and interpretations are not anticipated to have a material effect on the Groups financial statements except for additional disclosure.
The implementation of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 for Capital disclosures will increase the amount of disclosure regarding the significance, nature and associated risk of financial instruments.
The accounting, income and net assets will remain unaltered.
IFRS 8 is a standard that will increase the amount of disclosure and this will be considered when preparing the financial statements for the year ending January 2010.

The impact of this change is that: Operating profit remains unchanged.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Group has three classes of financial instruments that are potentially dilutive: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Groups ordinary shares during the period, the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan and preference shares.
At 4 February 2007, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
