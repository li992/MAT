In 2004 the Association of Investment Companies the AIC, together with JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc, launched a case against HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to challenge whether Value Added Tax VAT should be charged on management services provided to investment trust companies.
On 28 June 2007, the European Court of Justice ECJ delivered its judgement on the case.
Although the judgement is favourable to the AIC, the case may be referred back to the hearing of the UK courts.
Accordingly, as at the date of this report there is no certainty that investment managers will be entitled to the repayment of any of the VAT charged by them to their investment trust company clients.
If in due course the AICs case is successful, the Manager would be able to reclaim from HMRC the VAT which has been charged to the Company in respect of management services.
The VAT so recovered by the Manager would then be repaid by the Manager to the Company together with those amounts of VAT retained by the Manager since the year 2004.
The Company understands that the Manager has submitted protective claims to HMRC in respect of the relevant periods for VAT accounted for by the Manager on management services provided by it to the Company.
Because of the remaining legal uncertainties it is not possible to consider the recovery of any of the VAT borne as virtually certain and therefore no amounts receivable have been recognised in these accounts.
However, on the basis of the ECJ judgement it would seem that the likelihood of realising some benefit is probable.
The Board will monitor closely the outcome of the AIC case and is in discussion with the Manager as to the determination of the amounts that will be receivable by the Company if the AIC case is ultimately successful.
However, until the AIC case has reached its final determination and the discussions with the Manager have been concluded, it is not practicable to quantify the total amount of any VAT that may be recoverable.
