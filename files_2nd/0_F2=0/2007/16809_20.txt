Non-GAAP Information Adjusted Operating Profit The Group presents operating profit excluding non-operating income of associates, impairment losses and other income and expense for the Group and the Group's reported segments.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to report these measures for the following reasons: these measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis: the presentation by the Group's reported business segments of these measures facilitates comparability with other companies, although the Group's measures may not be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
Reconciliation of these measures to the closest equivalent GAAP measure, operating loss profit, is provided in Performance Operating Results beginning on page 34.
Organic Growth The Group believes that organic growth, which is not intended to be a substitute, or superior to, reported growth, provides useful and necessary information to investors and other interested parties for the following reasons: it provides additional information on underlying growth of the business without the effect of factors unrelated to the operating performance of the business: it is used by the Group for internal performance analysis: and it facilitates comparability of underlying growth with other companies, although the term organic is not a defined term under IFRS, or US GAAP, and may not, therefore, be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

62 Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2007 Cash Flow Measures In presenting and discussing the Group's reported results, free cash flow and operating free cash flow are calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate free cash flow to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: free cash flow allows the Company and external parties to evaluate the Group's liquidity and the cash generated by the Group's operations.
Free cash flow does not include items determined independently of the ongoing business, such as the level of dividends, and items which are deemed discretionary, such as cash flows relating to acquisitions and disposals or financing activities.
In addition, it does not necessarily reflect the amounts which the Group has an obligation to incur.
However, it does reflect the cash available for such discretionary activities, to strengthen the balance sheet or to provide returns to shareholders in the form of dividends or share purchases: free cash flow facilitates comparability of results with other companies, although the Group's measure of free cash flow may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: it is used by management for planning, reporting and incentive purposes: and it is useful in connection with discussion with the investment analyst community and debt rating agencies.
The Group believes that the presentation of operating free cash flow is useful and necessary for investors and other interested parties as it provides the quantitative basis for the cash flow targets of the cost reduction initiatives outlined on pages 38 to 39.
This measure may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
A reconciliation of net cash inflow from operating activities, the closest equivalent GAAP measure, to operating free cash flow and free cash flow, is provided in Performance - Financial Position and Resources on page 52.
Net Debt In presenting and discussing the Group's indebtedness and liquidity position, net debt is calculated.
There is no definition of net debt within IFRS.
The Group believes that it is both useful and necessary to communicate net debt to investors and other interested parties, for the following reasons: net debt assists the Company and external parties in evaluating the Group's overall indebtedness and liquidity position: net debt facilitates comparability of indebtedness and liquidity with other companies, although the Group's measure of net debt may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies: it is used by management for planning and reporting purposes: and it is used in discussions with the investment analyst community and the debt rating agencies.
A reconciliation of short term and long term borrowings, the closest equivalent GAAP measures, to net debt is shown on page 55.
Other Certain of the statements within the section titled Strategy - Chief Executive's Review on pages 6 to 7 and the section titled Performance - Cost reduction initiatives, on pages 38 to 39, contain forward-looking non-GAAP financial information for which at this time there is no comparable GAAP measure and which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
Certain of the statements within the section titled Performance - Risk Factors, Seasonality and Outlook on pages 58 to 60, contain forward-looking nonGAAP financial information which at this time cannot be quantitatively reconciled to comparable GAAP financial information.
