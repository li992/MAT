During 2007, the provisional fair values of Falanxs accounts receivable and other creditors were nalized resulting in a reduction in net assets acquired of 17,000.
As a result, goodwill increased by 17,000 during the year.
Soisic SA On 30 October 2006, the Company purchased the entire share capital of Soisic SA Soisic, a silicon-on-insulator SOI IP company incorporated in France for consideration of 5.1 million 3.4 million, comprising 4.7 million cash consideration and 0.4 million of related acquisition expenses.
With this acquisition, the Company is making an investment in new technologies related to physical IP to enhance its leadership position in providing customers access to the higher performance and lower power offered by SOI process technologies.
Soisic develops a similar set of products to the ARM Physical IP Division, specically standard cells, static random access memory SRAM compilers and input output I O cells, however, based on SOI design rules and process models.
Integrating this capability with ARMs widely-used physical IP opens the possibility for system-on-chip SoC designers to access SOI technology, which currently is used only in full custom designs, such as high-performance microprocessors.
The Company is investing in this area to be at the forefront of the design technologies needed to exploit the potential advantages of SOI as its usage grows in mobile, home and enterprise SoC and ASIC applications.
A further 8 million was potentially payable on the achievement of various post-acquisition financial milestones and will be accrued when the milestones have been achieved, other than as noted below, whereby a small portion of this contingent consideration was accrued at acquisition.
The operating results for Soisic have been included in these financial statements for the period from 30 October 2006 to 31 December 2006 in the 2006 comparatives and for the entire year in 2007.
