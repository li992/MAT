The directors do not consider it possible to estimate with precision the fair value of the Groups investments in these companies carrying value at 31 December 2007: 3,701,000: 2006: 1,970,000 as they are, by denition, not traded on an organised market and are unique in their activities.
However, based on recent fundraising transactions by these companies and, where possible, following review of relevant financial information prepared by the companies, the directors are of the opinion that the fair value of these investments approximates to carrying value.
Provisions have been made against other investments to reect any impairment in value.
Included in other investments are the Groups less than 1% investment in the share capital of Palmchip Corporation a private fabless chip company based in California : a less than 1% investment in the share capital of Pixim Inc. also a private fabless chip company based in California : and a 1.4% holding in Reciva Limited, an internet radio company based in the UK.
