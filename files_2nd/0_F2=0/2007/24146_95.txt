Life & Pensions EEV profit a Contribution from new business The contribution from new business is calculated using economic assumptions at the beginning of the period.
The contribution from new business using end-of-period economic and operating assumptions was 189m 2006: 196m which in 2007, includes the impact of capitalising 20m of development costs as maintenance.
The contribution from new business is quoted after cost of required capital and share incentives.
The table below gives the contribution before cost of capital and share based payments.
2007 2006 m m Contribution from new business before cost of capital and share based payments 218 212 Cost of share based payments 3 2 Cost of capital 9 6 Contribution from new business 206 204 b Profit from existing business Life & Pensions Profit from existing Life & Pensions business comprises the expected return on the value of in-force business at the start of the period plus the impact of any changes in the assumptions regarding future operating experience, changes in the reserving basis other than economic assumption changes and profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience for the period and the assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the end of the period.
The expected return on the value of in-force business is the difference between the expected return on the assets backing the liabilities and the expected return on the market-consistent value of the liabilities.
Effectively, this approach is similar to applying an unwind in the risk discount rate to the value of the in-force business at the beginning of the year.
However, the risk discount rate to be used is a rate appropriate over the period of return only, which is not necessarily equal to the overall in-force risk discount rate averaged across all future durations above.
