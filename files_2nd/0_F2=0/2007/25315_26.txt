Tax expense continued The rate of tax expense on the profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2007 is higher than 2006: higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.
The differences are explained as follows: 2007 2006 m m Profit before taxation 47.0 34.6 Profit before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30% 14.1 10.4 Effects of: adjustment in respect of prior years 1.0 0.5 adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates 4.6 4.4 expenses not deductible for tax purposes 5.0 4.4 overseas taxable dividends 1.0 0.7 Total tax expense 14.5 11.6 As noted on page 30 the Group operates in a number of different countries where tax legislation and practice can vary significantly and the precise tax treatment can often not be agreed until tax audits have been completed by the tax authorities.
The Polish business has been subject to a tax audit in respect of the years 2003 and 2004.
As at 31 December 2007 this audit process is still ongoing.
After taking into account certain indemnities provided by the former parent company the directors of IPF plc believe that the audit will not result in a material unprovided tax liability.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity shareholders of 32.5m 2006: 23.0m by the weighted average number of IPF ordinary shares in existence of 257.2 million, 2006: number of IPF ordinary shares in existence at date of demerger of 257.2 million.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of IPF ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares relating to employees of the Group.
The weighted average number of shares used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations can be reconciled as follows: 2007 2006 m m Used in basic EPS calculation 257.2 257.2 Dilutive effect of awards 0.3 0.3 Used in diluted EPS calculation 257.5 257.5 Basic and diluted earnings per share are presented below: 2007 2006 pence pence Basic EPS 12.64 8.94 Dilutive effect of awards 0.02 0.01 Diluted EPS 12.62 8.93 A pro forma EPS and a reconciliation to the statutory EPS is presented in note 34.
Dividends 2007 2006 m m 2007 interim dividend paid of 1.90 pence per share 4.9 The directors are recommending a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of 2.85 pence per share which will amount to a dividend payment of 7.3m.
If approved by the shareholders at the annual general meeting, this dividend will be paid on 23 May 2008 to shareholders who are on the register of members at 11 April 2008.
This dividend is not reflected as a liability in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2007 as it is subject to shareholder approval.

Acquisition of a subsidiary On 28 December 2007, one of the Groups subsidiary companies, International Personal Finance Investments Limited, acquired a 99.9% share in OOO Maritime Commercial Bank of Kaliningrad, a bank in Russia.
The cash consideration and fair value of net assets acquired are detailed below: Group m Cost of investment Consideration payable 2.8 Directly attributable acquisition costs 0.8 3.6 Fair value of assets acquired Cash 1.2 Intangible asset 3.0 Other net assets 0.6 3.6 Goodwill The fair value of assets acquired was equal to the book value of these assets immediately prior to acquisition other than for the intangible asset.
The intangible asset relates to the licence to trade as a bank in Russia.
The fair value of this banking licence has been estimated at 3.0m.
The acquired entity had materially all of its existing trading activity transferred out of it prior to the purchase.
Following acquisition, the bank incurred nil of expenses and therefore nil of expenses is included in the Group result.
As the bank had materially all of its existing activity transferred out prior to the acquisition, if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period the revenue and profit of the Group would have been unchanged.

Investment in subsidiaries Company 2007 m Investment in subsidiary 663.6 Share-based payment adjustment 0.4 664.0 IPF plc acquired the international businesses of the Provident Financial plc group on 16 July 2007 by issuing one IPF plc share to the shareholders of Provident Financial plc for each Provident Financial plc share held by them.
The fair value of the consideration issued in exchange for the investment in these international businesses was 663.6m and this amount was therefore capitalised as a cost of investment.

Deferred tax has not been provided on temporary differences arising on investments in certain overseas subsidiaries because the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The Companys policy is to retain profits in such overseas subsidiaries for the foreseeable future.
The aggregate temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax has been provided amounts to 271.6m 2006: 179.1m.
The unprovided deferred tax amounts to 26.6m 2006: 16.4m.

The Group uses interest rate swaps in order to fix the interest payable on a large proportion of its borrowings.
In addition the Group also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to economically hedge against forecast profits denominated in foreign currency.
These foreign exchange contracts do not hedge against a specific future cash flow so do not qualify for hedge accounting: changes in their fair value are therefore taken to the income statement.
The Group has no fair value hedges.
Cash flow hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps cash flow hedges to hedge those interest cash flows that are expected to occur within four years of the balance sheet date and foreign currency cash flows that are expected to occur within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The effect on the income statement will also be within these periods.
An amount of 1.4m has been credited to equity in the period in respect of cash flow hedges 2006: 1.8m.
The total notional principal of outstanding interest rate swaps that the Group is committed to is 250.1m 2006: 233.7m.
The weighted average interest rate and period to maturity of the Group interest rate swaps was as follows: Group 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average Range of average average Range of average interest interest period to interest interest period to rate rates maturity rate rates maturity % % Years %% Years Polish zloty 5.5 5.4-5.8 1.5 6.1 4.5-7.9 0.9 Czech crown 3.9 3.8-4.2 1.4 3.2 2.3-4.2 0.9 Hungarian forint 7.0 6.8-7.3 1.6 7.8 6.3-9.6 1.3 Slovak crown 4.5 4.4-4.5 1.6 3.9 2.7-5.3 1.2 Mexican peso 8.5 8.2-9.7 1.5 8.7 8.2-9.7 1.9 The Company has no interest rate swaps.
The majority of the interest rate swaps are designated and are effective under IAS 39 as cash flow hedges, and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity within the hedging reserve.
A charge of 0.2m 2006: nil has been made to the income statement in the year representing the movement in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the interest rate swaps.

Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign exchange contracts The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Group is committed to at 31 December 2007 is 17.6m 2006: 45.1m.
These comprise: forward foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of 17.6m 2006: 6.7m.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to November 2008 2006: August 2007.
These contracts have been designated and are effective as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 and accordingly the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity: and at 31 December 2006, foreign currency put sterling call options with a total notional amount of 38.4m and maturity dates up to December 2007.
No such options were outstanding as at 31 December 2007.
The options were taken out to economically hedge the translation risk on the profit loss of overseas countries but do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The credit to the income statement for the year to 31 December 2007 in respect of these options was 0.4m 2006: credit of 0.5m.
The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency contracts that the Company is committed to at 31 December 2007 is 13.1m.
These comprise: forward foreign currency contracts to buy or sell sterling for a total notional amount of 13.1m.
These contracts have various maturity dates up to June 2008.
These contracts have not been designated as cash flow hedges under IAS 39 as they exactly match the underlying item and therefore the amounts charged credited to the income statement are offset by credits charges in respect of the underlying item.
Risks arising from financial instruments Risk management Treasury related risks The board approves treasury policies and the treasury function manages the day-to-day operations.
The board delegates certain responsibilities to the treasury committee.
The treasury committee, which is chaired by the Finance Director, is empowered to take decisions within that delegated authority.
Treasury activities and compliance with the treasury policies are reported to the board on a regular basis and are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Treasury policies are designed to manage the main financial risks faced by the Group in relation to funding, investment and hedging.
These policies ensure that the borrowings and investments are with high quality counterparties: are limited to specific instruments: the exposure to any one counterparty or type of instrument is controlled: and the Groups exposure to interest rate and exchange rate movements is maintained within set limits.
The treasury function enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups underlying business operations.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken and written options may only be used when matched by purchased options.
Amounts receivable from customers Risk management policies in respect of amounts receivable from customers are discussed in the credit risk section on pages 75 and 76.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in interest rates in each of its countries of operation and therefore seeks to limit this net exposure.
This is achieved by the use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of borrowings over a certain time period, usually four years.
Interest costs are a relatively low proportion of the Groups revenue, 5.4% in 2007 and therefore the risk of a material variance arising from a change in interest rates is low.
If interest rates across all markets increased by 200 basis points this would have the following impact: 2007 2006 m m Increase in fair value of derivatives taken to equity 4.9 3.8 Reduction in profit before tax 4.8 1.8 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: the change in the market interest rate occurs in all countries where the Group has borrowings and or derivative financial instruments: where financial liabilities are subject to fixed interest rates or have their interest rate fixed by hedging instruments it is assumed that there is no impact from a change in interest rates: and changes in market interest rate affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
co. uk ar07 financials International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 75 21.
Risks arising from financial instruments continued Currency risk The Group is subject to three types of currency risk: net asset exposure, cash flow exposure and profit and loss exposure.
Net asset exposure The majority of the Groups net assets are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The consolidated balance sheet is reported in sterling and this means that there is a risk that a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
The Group aims to minimise the value of net assets denominated in each foreign currency by funding overseas receivables by borrowings in local currency.
The net assets of the Group are spread amongst a number of diverse currencies with different underlying currency risks, the risk of all currencies moving in the same way against sterling is therefore reduced.
Cash flow exposure The Group is subject to currency risk in respect of future cash flows which are denominated in foreign currency.
The policy of the Group is to hedge a large proportion of this currency risk in respect of cash flows which are expected to arise in the following 12 months.
Where forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, they are designated as cash flow hedges on specific future transactions.
Profit and loss exposure As with net assets, the majority of the Groups profit is denominated in currencies other than sterling but translated into sterling for reporting purposes.
The result for the period is translated into sterling at the average exchange rate.
A risk therefore arises that a fluctuation in the exchange rates in the countries in which the Group operates will have a material impact on the consolidated result for the period.
The Group reduces the exposure to this risk by economically hedging a proportion of the budgeted profits which results in a currency variance in the trading result being partly offset by a gain or loss on the relevant foreign exchange contract.
The following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the impact on equity of a 5% strengthening or weakening of sterling against all exchange rates for the countries in which the Group operates.
2007 2006 m m Change in profit and loss reserves 0.1 0.1 Change in profit before tax 0.2 0.1 This sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: there is a 5% strengthening weakening of sterling against all currencies the Group operates in Polish zloty, Czech crown, Slovakian crown, Hungarian forint, Mexican peso and Romania leu : and there is no impact on the profit or loss reserve or equity arising from those items which are naturally hedged where the currency asset is exactly equal to the currency liability.
Credit risk The Group is subject to credit risk in respect of the amounts receivable from customers and the cash and cash equivalents held on deposit with banks.
Amounts receivable from customers The risk of material unexpected credit losses in respect of amounts receivable from customers is low as the Group lends small amounts over short-term periods to a large and diverse group of customers across the six countries in which the Group operates.
This risk is minimised by only lending to those customers who, as evidenced by our credit scoring techniques, can afford the repayments.
The amount lent to each customer and the repayment period agreed are dependent upon the risk category the customer is assigned to as part of the application scoring process.
The level of expected future losses are reviewed by management on a weekly basis by geographical segment in order to ensure that appropriate action can be taken if losses differ from management expectations.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Cash and cash equivalents The Group only deposits cash with highly rated banks and sets strict limits in respect of the amount to be held on deposit with any one institution.
No collateral or credit enhancements are held in respect of any financial assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is as follows: Group 2007 2006 m m Cash and cash equivalents 88.8 44.5 Amounts receivable from customers 443.2 331.0 Derivative financial instruments 0.7 0.6 Trade and other receivables 9.0 6.5 Total 541.7 382.6 The above table represents a worst case scenario of the credit risk that the Group is exposed to at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers by geographical segment is presented in note 15 and of the cash and cash equivalents in note 16.
Derivative financial instruments and trade and other debtors have not been presented by geographical segment as they are not considered significant.
Cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and trade and other debtors are neither past due nor impaired.
Credit quality of these assets is good and the cash and cash equivalents are spread over a number of banks, each of which meets the criteria set out in our treasury policies which are explained further in the principal risks section of this report, to ensure the risk of loss is minimised.
Amounts receivable from customers are stated at amortised cost and calculated in accordance with the accounting policy set out on page 61.
Those amounts receivable from customers that are neither past due nor impaired represent loans where no customer payments have been missed and there is therefore no evidence to suggest that the credit quality is anything other than adequate.
The Groups accounting policy in respect of amounts receivable from customers requires that as soon as a customer misses any portion of a contractual payment the account is reviewed for impairment and the receivable is reduced to reflect the revised expected future cash flows.
The result of this is that any loan which is past due where a payment has been missed will attract a deduction for impairment.
Therefore the amounts receivable from customers include no amounts that are past due but not impaired.
An analysis of the amounts receivable from customers that are individually determined to be impaired by geographical segment is set out below: Group 2007 2006 m m Central Europe 304.1 198.8 Mexico 17.2 11.4 Romania 2.3 323.6 210.2 This analysis includes all loans that have been subject to impairment.
The impairment charge is based on the average expected loss for each arrears stage of customer receivables and this average expected loss is applied to the entire arrears stage.
This results in a significant proportion of the amounts receivable from customers attracting an impairment charge.
For each market the amount by which an asset is impaired depends on the type of product, the recent payment performance and the number of weeks since the loan was issued.
There will therefore be a large amount of receivables which are classed as impaired but where the carrying value is still a large proportion of the contractual amount recoverable.
Annualised impairment as a percentage of revenue for each geographical market is shown below: Group 2007 2006 Central Europe 19.2% 27.9% Mexico 47.4% 47.3% Romania 12.8% n a The carrying value of amounts receivable from customers that would have been impaired had their terms not been renegotiated is nil.

Risks arising from financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group is subject to the risk that it will not have sufficient borrowing facilities to fund its existing business and its future plans for growth.
The short-term nature of the Groups business means that the majority of amounts receivable from customers are receivable within 12 months.
The risk of not having sufficient liquid resources is therefore low.
The treasury policy adopted by the Group serves to reduce this risk further by aiming to have i a diversity of funding sources across the banks which the Group uses and across the countries in which the Group operates: ii a balanced maturity profile of debt finance to mitigate refinancing risk: and iii committed facilities in excess of the forecast borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2007 the Groups committed borrowing facilities had an average period to maturity of 2.2 years.
As shown on page 72 total undrawn committed facilities as at 31 December 2007 were 175.4m.
On page 72 a maturity analysis of the gross borrowing included in the balance sheet is presented.
A maturity analysis of bank borrowings and overdrafts outstanding at the balance sheet date by contractual cash flow, including expected interest payments, is shown below: Group 2007 2006 m m Not later than six months 11.9 17.2 Later than six months and not later than one year 20.9 70.0 Later than one year and not later than two years 23.6 86.6 Later than two years and not later than five years 374.9 97.3 431.3 271.1 The above analysis includes the contractual cash flow for borrowings and includes the total amount of interest payable over the life of the loan.
Where borrowings are subject to a floating interest rate an estimate of interest payable is taken.
The following analysis shows the gross undiscounted contractual cash flows in respect of derivative liabilities which are all designated as cash flow hedges: Group 2007 2006 Outflow Inflow Outflow Inflow m m m m Not later than one month 4.5 4.4 1.0 1.0 Later than one month and not later than six months 13.1 12.6 10.6 10.3 Later than six months and not later than one year 0.7 0.7 0.4 Later than one year and not later than two years 0.3 Later than two years and not later than five years 0.2 18.3 17.7 12.5 11.3 All trade and other payables are expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date.

Capital risk The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business.
The Group aims to maintain appropriate capital to ensure that it has a strong balance sheet but at the same time is providing a good return on capital to its shareholders.
The Groups long-term aim is to ensure that the capital structure results in an optimal ratio of debt and equity finance.
Capital is monitored by considering the ratio of equity to receivables and the gearing ratio borrowings to equity.
The capital of the Group and these ratios are shown below: 2007 m Receivables 443.2 Borrowings 370.8 Other net assets 131.2 Equity 203.6 Equity as % of receivables 45.9% Gearing 1.8 Equity as a percentage of receivables was above the internal minimum requirement set by the Group.
Gearing, which is equal to borrowings divided by net assets, at a ratio of 1.8 times at 31 December 2007, is well within covenant limits.

Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value which is equal to the expected future cash flows arising as a result of the derivative transaction.
For other financial assets and liabilities, which are all short-term in nature, the carrying value is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Retirement benefit obligations a Pension schemes defined benefit During the period from 1 January 2006 to 16 July 2007 certain of the Groups employees were members of two funded defined benefit pension schemes operated by Provident Financial plc.
As part of the demerger, it was agreed that the companies and employees of the new International Personal Finance plc group the Group would continue to participate in the Provident Financial plc pension scheme arrangements until 31 December 2007.
On 1 January 2008, the Group set up a new funded defined benefit scheme for those individuals who had previously been members of the schemes operated by Provident Financial plc.
As part of the demerger agreement, the liabilities relating to the past and present employees of the Group are to be transferred from the Provident Financial plc schemes to the new scheme together with an agreed amount of assets.
The amount of assets to be transferred broadly equals the value of liabilities on 16 July 2007 adjusted to allow for subsequent investment returns and cash flows plus 3.5m.

Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
Different assumptions are used for different groups of members.
Most members have not yet retired.
On average, we expect a male retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 22 years.
On average, we expect a female retiring in the future at age 65 to live for a further 25 years.
If assumed life expectancies had been assumed to be one year greater for all members, the charge to the income statement would have increased by 0.002m and the present value of defined benefit obligations would have increased by approximately 0.724m.

All eligible UK employees joining after that date are now invited to join a stakeholder pension plan into which the Group contributes 8% of members pensionable earnings, provided the employee contributes a minimum of 6%.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The pension charge in the income statement represents contributions payable by the Group in respect of the plan and amounted to 101,000 for the year ended 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: 55,000. nil of contributions were payable to the plan at the year end 31 December 2006: nil.
Share-based payments The Group operates three share schemes: The International Personal Finance plc Incentive Plan the Incentive Plan, The International Personal Finance plc Performance Share Plan the Performance Share Plan, and The International Personal Finance plc Exchange Share Scheme 2007 the Exchange Scheme.
The income statement charge in respect of the Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Plan has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these schemes are subject to a Total Shareholder Return performance target.
The total income statement charge in respect of these share-based payments is 0.9m 2006: nil.
The income statement charge in respect of the Exchange Scheme is equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of award share price at date of award adjusted for dividends.

Share-based payments continued No exercise price is payable in respect of awards made under the Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan and Exchange Scheme.
As IPF plc shares have only been traded since the date of demerger 16 July 2007 the expected volatility is based on the three-year volatilities of comparable companies.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.
For the Performance Share Plan the maximum number of shares that will be awarded is 1,483,799 assuming the 60% TSR target is met, for the Incentive Plan there is no maximum number of shares.
For both the Performance Share Plan and the Incentive Plan the fair value has been calculated based on an estimate of the amount of shares likely to vest.
No awards were outstanding at the beginning of the year as all awards were made post demerger on 20 July 2007.
Between 20 July 2007 and 31 December 2007 108,394 awards under the Performance Share Plan and 29,084 awards under the Exchange Scheme lapsed.
Further detail in respect of the Incentive Plan, Performance Share Plan and the Exchange Scheme is given in paragraphs 3.9 to 3.12 of the directors remuneration report.
In addition, an amount of 1.6m has been charged to the income statement in respect of an accelerated charge for share options in Provident Financial plc which became exercisable on demerger and a charge of 0.2m 2006: credit of 0.4m was made during the first six months of the year in respect of share options in Provident Financial plc.

co. uk ar07 financials International Personal Finance plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 89 The income statement pro forma adjustments can be explained as follows: a An adjustment has been included to increase finance costs to reflect the fact that IPF is subject to higher interest rates now that borrowings are no longer guaranteed by Provident Financial plc.
b As part of the demerger, IPF received a capital contribution of 70.0 million from Provident Financial plc see note 27.
This pro forma adjustment reflects the interest that would have been earned on this capital contribution had it been received prior to the start of 2006. c An adjustment in respect of additional corporate office costs is included to reflect that as a standalone entity with its own corporate office IPF incurs additional costs compared with when it was a division of Provident Financial plc.
d As part of the demerger IPF has moved to new premises and undergone a process of separating its IT systems.
The additional costs in respect of these items are included as a pro forma adjustment for 2006.
The property and IT changes had all occurred by the start of 2007 and therefore no adjustment is included to the 2007 result.
e While IPF was part of the Provident Financial plc group it was subject to certain interest charges that would not have been incurred if it was a standalone entity.
These interest charges which were not included in the reported profit for the international division in the Provident Financial plc segmental analysis have therefore been reversed.
f This pro forma adjustment reverses statutory charges in respect of the pension contributions which were made to the defined benefit pension schemes.
A one-off additional payment was made in 2006 of 5.3 million.
As IPF did not acquire the assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes until after the demerger it is required to charge these contributions to the income statement rather than increasing the pension surplus held on the balance sheet.
These contributions were not treated as a charge to the income statement within the international division result reported within the Provident Financial plc result.
Instead they were accounted for as a reduction in the Provident Financial plc pension deficit.
A reconciliation of the statutory profit for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 34.6 million to the profit included for the international division in the segmental analysis of Provident Financial plc is presented below: 2006 m International division profit before taxation reported in Provident Financial plc results 46.2 Pension adjustment 5.3 Group interest allocation 2.6 Exceptional demerger costs 4.2 Reduced recharge see below 0.5 34.6 The statutory recharge from Provident Financial plc was 0.5 million lower than that allocated to the international division for the Provident Financial plc segmental analysis.

The statutory financial information only includes a pension asset from the date of demerger which is the date at which Provident Financial plc agreed to transfer the scheme assets and liabilities in respect of IPF employees to IPF.
b Deferred tax on defined benefit pension asset.
c The cash balances of IPF plc which are excluded from the statutory consolidated financial information until the date of demerger.
d The amounts due from Provident Financial plc have been netted against borrowings in the pro forma information.
e This adjustment includes the 78.3 million due from Provident Financial plc which has been reclassified note d, the 70.0 million capital contribution which was received as part of the preparation for the demerger see note 27 and 3.0 million of demerger costs.
f This is the expected tax credit on the 3.0 million of demerger costs.
g This adjustment brings the share capital to that of IPF plc which is the legal share capital of the Group as at 31 December 2007.
The difference between the share capital of IPF plc and the share capital of the international businesses of Provident Financial plc has been credited to an other reserve.
