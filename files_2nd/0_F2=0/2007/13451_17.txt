RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES FORMING PART OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 General information Rightmove plc is a company incorporated in England and Wales No.
The Company operates in the UK residential property industry connecting people to properties.
Its principal business is the operation of the Rightmove.
co. uk website, which is the UKs largest residential property portal.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs as adopted by the European Union Adopted IFRSs and issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
Basis of preparation The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and the Groups interest in its subsidiaries.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
Both the Parent Company financial statements and the Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with Adopted IFRSs.
On publishing the Parent Company financial statements here together with the Group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these financial statements.
The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant inuence but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant inuence commences until the date that significant inuence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in associates, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of associates.
The minority shareholders of HLL have a put option which if exercised requires the Company to purchase its remaining 33.3% stake in HLL.
In accordance with IAS 32, the option for the purchase of the remaining 33.3% stake along with the existing investment in HLL of 66.7% have been accounted for at a consolidated level as if the Group holds 100% of the ordinary share capital in HLL and consequently no minority interest is recognised.
The impact on the balance sheet is to recognise a liability of 2,202,000 which is based upon six times forecast EBIT for the year ending 31 December 2008, being the earliest date that the put option could be exercised and to recognise a corresponding amount as additional goodwill.
In addition an interest charge of 126,000 has been adjusted against deferred consideration in the year as a result of an increase in the present value of the liability.
Judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
49 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 1 General information continued In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 15 Measurement of the recoverable amounts of cash generating units containing goodwill Note 24 Measurement of share-based payments 2 significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in associates are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the Parent company accounts.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method in the Group accounts.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classication and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 was not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
IFRS 1 permits goodwill on acquisitions made before this date to be brought on to the balance sheet at 1 January 2004 at its carrying value under UK GAAP.
ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property websites.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement when incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benets embodied in the specic asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software Computer software is capitalised and is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 20% 33.3% per annum iv Customer relationships Customer relationships are identied on the acquisition of a business and valued using discounted cash ows based on historical customer attrition rates.
Amortisation is expensed in the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Customer relationships 16.7% per annum 50 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Ofce equipment, xtures & ttings 20% per annum Computer equipment 20% per annum d Impairment The carrying value of the property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangibles which are not available for use are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually.
Whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Goodwill was tested for impairment at the transition date: no impairment was deemed necessary.
An impairment test is performed annually at 31 December on goodwill regardless of the existence of impairment indicators.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables trade receivables are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Trade payables trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classied as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
g Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risk specic to the liability.
Vacant leasehold properties a provision is maintained in respect of vacant leasehold properties where the lease is considered to be onerous to take account of the net present value of residual lease commitments over the remaining term of the lease.
51 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 2 significant accounting policies continued h Employee benets i Pensions The Company provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme dened contribution plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
ii Employee share schemes The share option programme allows certain senior management employees to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in the income statement over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on equity settled share-based payment schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which have not vested by 1 January 2005, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Awards made before this date are not accounted for under IFRS 2, as permitted under the transitional rules of IFRS 1.
For awards made after 7 November 2002 and not vested by 1 January 2005, the charge is based on the fair value of the option granted as at the grant date, calculated using an option pricing model.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of the Company and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of the Company and are therefore reected in the Parent Company and Group financial statements.
In particular, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
i Treasury shares When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either classied as treasury shares or cancelled.
j Revenue Revenue principally represents the amounts, excluding value added tax VAT, receivable from customers in respect of properties advertised on the website.
Revenue relating to properties advertised on the website is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Estate agency branches are billed in advance with net income deferred until the service commencement date.
The VAT liability is recognised at the point of invoice.
New home developers are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred revenue and released to the income statement on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
HLL revenue is principally billed annually in advance.
The revenue is spread equally over the 12 month period, with any deferred income held on the balance sheet.
k Segmental reporting A business segment is a distinguishable component of the Group engaged in providing products and services that is subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The Groups primary format for segmental reporting is by business segment.
l Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classication as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classied as held for sale, if earlier.
When an operation is classied as a discontinued operation, the comparative income statement is represented as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
52 52 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 m Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.
n Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight line basis over the lease term.
o Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and deposits.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Financial expenses comprise interest payable on bank loans and unwinding of the discount on deferred consideration.
Interest payable is recognised on an accruals basis.
p Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12 the Group policy in relation to the recognition of tax on share-based payments is to include the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction in the income statement to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the excess tax deduction is recognised in equity.
q Dividends Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
r Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note12.
53 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 3 Adopted IFRS not yet applied During the year the IASB and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC have issued new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material effect on its financial statements on initial adoption.
The standards and interpretations to be adopted include: International Financial Reporting Standards Effective date IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 1 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 1 2008 The effect of the initial application of IFRS 7 is shown in Note 29 of these accounts.
4 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board.
Prior to each monthly meeting the attendees will review the risk matrices and update them.
At the meeting, any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is inuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
Ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial conditions are performed.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an inuence on credit risk.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
54 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 More than 63% of the Groups customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identied loss exposures.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription based which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital, dividend and share buy back requirements and still remain in a surplus cash position.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
As at 31 December 2007, the Group had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses for a period in excess of 220 days.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Currency risk 99% of the Groups sales are Sterling denominated, with the balance being Euro denominated.
As the value of Euro denominated trade receivables is low in relation to total receivables, no amounts are hedged.
Interest rate risk The Group has no interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its cash balances and the deferred consideration in relation to the acquisition of HLL.
Refer to Note 29 for further explanation.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the spread of shareholders, as well as the return on capital and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
As at 31 December 2007 directors and senior managers hold 3.9% of ordinary shares.
In addition the executive directors are regarded as being interested for the purposes of the Companies Act 1985 in 8,353,700 6.3% ordinary shares in the Company currently held by the EBT as they are, together with other employees, potential beneciaries of the EBT.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions.
These shares are either transferred into treasury providing exibility for future share option issues or they are cancelled.
Buy and sell decisions are made on a specic transaction basis: the Group does not have a dened share buy back plan.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
55 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 5 Discontinued operations On 18 July 2006, the Government announced fundamental changes to the contents of the Home Information Pack HIP, specically that the Home Condition Report within the HIP would be voluntary for the foreseeable future.
As a consequence the Board decided to discontinue the HIPs business.
The total spend during 2006 was 6,668,000 including exit costs of 1,900,000 and research and development costs of 2,060,000.
The only operating cash outows associated with the HIPs business in 2007 were 60,000 relating to annual lease costs.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the HIPs business had cash outows from operating activities of 5,226,000.
The net book value of property, plant and equipment 315,000 and the net book value of intangibles relating to HIPs 696,000 were fully impaired during 2006.
6 Segmental reporting The Group does not have geographical segments with all revenue derived from external operations in the UK in both years.
Revenue derived outside the UK is not material in either 2006 or 2007.
Due to the discontinuance of the HIPs business in 2006 all activities in the current year relate to the property advertising segment.
There were no other separately identiable business segment income statement or balance sheet items.

The differences are explained below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 000 000 profit before tax 27,119 7,268 Current tax at 30% 2006: 30% 8,136 2,180 Share-based payments 322 331 Non deductible expenses 460 413 Change in tax rate 96 Deferred tax movement in respect of prior years 102 8,472 2,924 During the year, the Company utilised tax losses brought forward of 689,000.
These losses arose on the exercise of share options for which no related equity settled share option charge was recognised.
The reduction in the current year tax charge resulting from the utilisation of these losses has been reected in retained earnings in accordance with IFRS 2 and thus a notional tax charge of 689,000 has been applied for the year ended 31 December 2007 2006: 3,544,000.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2007 is 31% 2006: 40%.
The difference between the standard rate and effective rate at 31 December 2007 is attributable mainly to the high level of expenditure on which no tax relief is available but which is offset by the increase in the Companys deferred tax asset arising on share options.

From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2007 the acquisition contributed 1,499,000 to Group revenue and 216,000 to Group profit.
If the acquisition had been completed on the first day of the financial year, the acquisition would have contributed 1,968,000 to Group revenue and 381,000 to Group profit.
In terms of the shareholders agreement, a put and call option exists to acquire the remaining 33.3%.
The earliest opportunity HLL management has to exercise the put option is 30 June 2009 based on the audited accounts for the 12 months ending 31 December 2008.
The deferred consideration element has been recognised based on managements best estimate of likely EBIT for the year then ending at a multiple of six times the agreed formula and discounted at a risk-free rate of 5.7%.
At 31 December 2007 126,000 has been charged to financial expense representing the unwinding of the effective interest rate on deferred consideration.
This results in a carrying value of 2,328,000 for deferred consideration on the balance sheet.
All intangible assets were recognised at their fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
The adjustments applied to the book values of the assets and liabilities of HLL in order to present the net assets at fair values in accordance with Group accounting principles are as follows: Carrying values Fair value pre-acquisition adjustments Fair values Note 000 000 000 Net assets acquired Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 14 12 1 13 Intangible assets customer relationships 15 514 514 12 515 527 Current assets Trade and other receivables 279 16 263 Cash and cash equivalents 36 36 315 16 299 Current liabilities 207 417 624 Non-current liabilities Deferred tax liabilities 21 2 124 126 Fair value of net assets acquired 118 42 76 Purchase consideration cash 3,213 Purchase consideration accrued expenses 3 Purchase consideration deferred 2,202 Total consideration 5,418 Goodwill 15 5,342 75 RIGHTMOVE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 28 Acquisitions and disposals continued Upon acquisition the revenue recognition policy for HLL was changed to align it with the existing Group policy.
Revenue is principally billed annually in advance.
An adjustment of 422,000 has been reected in current liabilities to recognise the deferral of revenue over the 12 month contract period on a straight line basis as opposed to the previous upfront recognition policy.
Included in the 5,342,000 of goodwill recognised are intangible assets that do not meet the denition of intangible assets under IAS 38.
These items include an assembled workforce and operating synergies.

This gave rise to positive goodwill of 2,140,000 and an intangible asset relating to customer lists of 1,124,000.
The Groups share in the fair value of net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition was 56,000.
As a result of the discontinuance of the HIPs business, it was no longer considered appropriate to retain this shareholding.
Accordingly, the holding was disposed of for 3,243,000 before costs.
The sale gave rise to a consolidated loss on disposal of 206,000.
Whilst TM was an associate and before the decision to sell was made, the results of the associate were equity accounted for.
The Group recognised a profit of 129,000 representing its share of TMs profit for that period.
The directors decided to present the loss on disposal of 206,000 and the share of associates profit of 129,000 on the face of the income statement as share of associate loss of 77,000.

Pursuant to the Scheme of Arrangement, the Companys ordinary shareholders received ordinary shares in Rightmove Group plc, each having a nominal value of 3.35 Rightmove Group Ordinary Shares, in exchange for ordinary shares in the Company each having a nominal value of 0.01 Rightmove Ordinary Shares on a one-for-one basis at nil cost.
