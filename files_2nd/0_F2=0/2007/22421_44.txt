A Brief History The Company was formed as City of London Brewery Company Limited in 1860 to acquire Calverts, a family brewing business at Upper Thames Street in the City of London.
The brewery had extensive interests in the licensed premises trade.
In 1932 the name was changed to The City of London Brewery and Investment Trust Limited, parts of the business having been sold and the proceeds invested in securities according to investment trust principles.
In 1968 the remaining part of the brewery business was sold and the Company concentrated exclusively on investments in securities.
In 1970 the Company appointed Touche, Remnant & Co. as Investment Manager and in 1982 the name was changed to TR City of London Trust PLC.
In 1992 Touche, Remnant & Co. was acquired by Henderson Administration Group plc now Henderson Global Investors Holdings plc.
Henderson Global Investors Holdings plc was acquired by AMP in the spring of 1998.
In December 2003 Henderson Group plc, the holding company of Henderson Global Investors Holdings plc, was demerged from AMP and is quoted on the London and Australian Stock Exchanges.
Henderson Group plc is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
The name of the Company was changed to The City of London Investment Trust plc in October 1997.
