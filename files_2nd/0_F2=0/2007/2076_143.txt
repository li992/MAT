Under IAS 39 AASB 139 all derivatives are initially including the retrospective restatement of comparative periods.
In recognised at their fair value on the date a derivative contract is accordance with elections made under the transition provisions, IFRS entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.

An adjustment is made to reverse the impact of hedge written down to its fair value based on discounted cash flows.
US accounting under IAS 39 AASB 139 for amounts included in equity in GAAP results in lower impairment charges against income and higher the hedging reserve.
Accordingly, under US GAAP, both unrealised and asset carrying amounts, and in the case of the divestment of an asset, realised gains or losses are recorded in net income.
Furthermore, a lower profit on sale: the difference in asset carrying amounts is certain commodity contracts have been treated as derivatives under subsequently reduced through higher depreciation charges SFAS 133 because they have not been specifically identified as normal against income.

Accordingly, with reference to the SECs Industry Guide 7.
Under US GAAP, exchange gains on the hedging of the consideration were recorded depreciation charges have been adjusted to reflect the difference as net foreign exchange gains in the income statement.
On acquisition of WMC, a restructuring provision relating to office closure and employee termination costs was recognised.
In accordance with IFRS 3 AASB 3 Business Combinations, the amount was recognised in the income statement.
Under US GAAP, EITF 95-3 Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination allows restructuring provisions assumed in a purchase business combination to be included in the allocation of the acquisition cost.

Impact of new accounting standards In February 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
155 Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments SFAS 155.
SFAS 155 provides relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise have to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with SFAS 133.
SFAS 155 allows an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety, with changes in fair value recognised in earnings.
Additionally, SFAS 155 requires that interests in securitised financial assets be evaluated to identify whether they are freestanding derivatives or hybrid financial instruments containing an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation, which were previously exempt from SFAS 133.
This is effective for all financial instruments acquired, issued, or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after 15 September 2006.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting SFAS 155.
In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB reached a consensus in Issue No.
06-9 Reporting a Change in or the Elimination of a Previously Existing Difference Between the Fiscal Year-End of a Parent Company and That of a Consolidated Entity or Between the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee EITF 06-9.
EITF 06-9 concludes that a change in a subsidiarys or equity method investees reporting period is a change in accounting principle.
Therefore, the parent or investor should recognise the effects of the change through retrospective application to all prior periods pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
154 Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.
EITF 06-9 is effective for fiscal years beginning after 29 November 2006.
The application of EITF 06-9 is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
In June 2006, FASB Interpretation No.
48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.
FIN 48 requires tax benefits from an uncertain position to be recognised only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable, based on its technical merits.
The interpretation also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in recognised tax benefits over the next 12 months, a description of open tax years by major jurisdiction, and a roll-forward of all unrecognised tax benefits.
FIN 48 applies for the Groups financial year beginning 1 July 2007.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting FIN 48.
In June 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB reached a consensus in Issue No.
06-3 How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should be Presented in the Income Statement That is, Gross versus Net Presentation EITF 06-3.
EITF 06-3 concludes that an entity may elect to present on either a gross or a net basis based on their accounting policy.
This applies to sales and other taxes that are imposed on and concurrent with individual revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer.
The gross basis includes the taxes in revenues and costs: the net basis excludes the taxes from revenues.
The consensus would not apply to tax systems that are based on gross receipts or total revenues.
This EITF is effective for the Groups financial year beginning 1 July 2007.
The application of EITF 06-3 is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
SFAS 157 provides a single definition of fair value, together with a framework for measuring it, and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities.
SFAS 157 emphasises that fair value is a market based measurement, not an entity specific measurement, and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets.
The principles of SFAS 157 are similar to those applied by the Group in determining fair value for embedded derivative under IFRS.
This statement is effective for the Groups financial year beginning 1 July 2008 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
In November 2006, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB published Issue No.
06-11 Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share-Based Payment Awards EITF 06-11.
EITF 06-11 considers that dividend payment made in share based payment arrangements where the employee may receive dividend protection features that entitle them to dividends during the vesting period or until the exercise date for share options are generally a deductible compensation expense for income tax purposes.
This draft EITF requires an entity to recognise the realised tax benefit as an increase in additional paid-in capital.
This EITF is effective for the Groups financial year beginning 1 July 2008.
The Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting EITF 06-11.
