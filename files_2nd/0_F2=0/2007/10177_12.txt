Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance the financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with current International Financial reporting Standards IFrS.
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFrS adopted for use in the european union and therefore comply with article of the eu IaS regulation.
Basis of preparation the financial statements of Michael page International plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
as permitted by Section 0 of the Companies act 198, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these accounts.
the Companys profit for the financial year amounted to 0.7m 006: 6.7m.
Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
the financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii transactions eliminated on consolidation I ntragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
iii employee Benefit trust In accordance with uItF 8, accounting for employee Share ownership plan eSop trusts, shares in Michael page International plc held by the trust are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
other assets and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
the policies, set out below, have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
new standards and interpretations In the current year, the Group has adopted IFrS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 007, and the related amendment to IaS 1 presentation of Financial Statements.
the impact of the adoption of IFrS 7 and the changes to IaS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital see note.
Four Interpretations issued by the International Financial reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
these are: IFrIC 7 applying the restatement approach under IaS 9, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies: IFrIC 8 Scope of IFrS : IFrIC 9 reassessment of embedded Derivates: and IFrIC 10 Interim Financial reporting and Impairment.
the adoption of these interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations impacting the Group which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFrS 8 operating Segments IaS revised Borrowing Costs IFrIC 11 IFrS Group and treasury Share transactions IFrIC 1 Service Concession arrangements IFrIC 1 Customer loyalty programmes IFrIC 1 IaS 19 the limit of a Defined Benefit asset, Minimum Funding requirements and their Interaction 8 MIChael paGe InternatIonal 1.
Significant accounting policies continued new standards and interpretations continued the Directors anticipate that the adoption of the above Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have little or no impact on the financial statements of the Group when the relevant Standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 008. a Revenue and income recognition revenue, which excludes value added tax Vat, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group as its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
these consist of: revenue from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary cost of these staff.
this is recognised when the service has been provided: revenue from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package, and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of defined stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate and where a start date has been determined.
the latter includes revenue anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within prepayments and accrued income.
a provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and revenue from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
c Gross profit Gross profit represents revenue less cost of sales and consists of the total placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and the margin on advertising income.
d foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
the consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
ii transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the respective functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
iii Group companies the results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Significant accounting policies continued e Intangible assets i goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy h. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
ii computer software Computer software acquired by the Group is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below.
iii amortisation amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life.
Computer software is amortised at 0% per annum.
the cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to retained earnings in respect of acquisitions prior to 1 December 1997 is 11.7m 006: 11.7m.
f Property, plant and equipment property, plant and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, fixtures and equipment 10- 0% per annum Motor vehicles % per annum g Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
h Impairment of assets assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
the recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
a financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
a financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events has had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
the carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Significant accounting policies continued i taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
the tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
the Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
j Pension costs the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes.
the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
the pension costs charged to the income statement represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
k leased assets leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
all other leases are classified as operating leases.
assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to profit or loss.
leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classed as operating leases.
rentals under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l Segment reporting the consolidated entity operates in one business segment being that of recruitment services primary segment.
as a result no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
the consolidated entity operates in four geographic segments secondary segment, eMea, the united Kingdom, asia pacific and the americas.
Significant accounting policies continued m Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
n Share-based compensation the Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
their accounting treatments are described below: i share option schemes the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense.
the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, earnings per share.
non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
at each balance sheet date, the estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable is revised.
the Group recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and the corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
ii deferred annual bonus and long term Incentive Plans Where deferred awards are made to Directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share plan or the annual Bonus Scheme, to reflect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates.
o Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
p Provisions a provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
q Borrowing costs all borrowing costs are accrued in the income statement on a time basis.
r financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
non-derivative financial instruments comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash-in-hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
trade and other payables are stated at cost.
other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
the Group has no financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments or available for sale financial assets under IFrS 7. additionally, as the Group has no derivative contracts at the balance sheet date, the requirements of the recognition criteria under IaS 9 are also not relevant to the Group.
Significant accounting policies continued s Critical accounting estimates and judgements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFrS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and judgements.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the Companys accounting policies.
estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Management anticipate that any estimates and judgements made do not have a material effect on the results.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: note 1 revenue recognition note 17 utilisation of tax losses note 18 measurement of share-based payments 2.
Segment reporting the consolidated entity operates in one business segment, being that of recruitment services, and this is the Groups primary segment.
as a result, no additional business segment information is required to be provided.
the Groups secondary segment is geography.
the analysis below is of the carrying amount of segment assets, liabilities and capital expenditure.
Segment assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
the individual geographic segments exclude income tax assets and liabilities.
Capital expenditure comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, motor vehicles and computer hardware software.
Were the cash pool to be shown on a net basis, this would reduce both the total liabilities in the uK and the total assets in eMea by 9. m each.
Further information on the notional cash pool is provided in note 1 on page 77. c Revenue and gross profit by discipline Revenue Gross Profit 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Finance and Accounting 496,506 408,250 258,667 202,542 Marketing, Sales and Retail 119,103 100,153 89,910 67,863 Legal, Technology, HR, Secretarial and Other 134,908 96,595 73,835 46,655 Engineering, Property & Construction, Procurement & Supply Chain 81,123 44,062 55,682 31,757 831,640 649,060 478,094 348,817 d Revenue and gross profit generated from permanent and temporary placements Revenue Gross Profit 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Permanent 392,583 276,346 371,998 261,000 Temporary 439,057 372,714 106,096 87,817 831,640 649,060 478,094 348,817 the above analyses in notes a operating profit by geographic region, b segment liabilities by geographic region, c revenue and gross profit by discipline being the professions of candidates placed and d revenue and gross profit generated from permanent and temporary placements have been included as additional disclosure over and above the requirements of IaS1 Segment reporting.

p per ordinary share will be paid on 9 June 008 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 9 May 008, subject to approval by shareholders.
When the Company pays a dividend to shareholders, there may be income tax consequences.
the impact will depend upon the individual circumstances of the shareholder.
Earnings per ordinary share the calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2007 2006 Earnings for basic and diluted earnings per share 000 101,734 65,447 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings per share 000 327,528 334,744 Dilution effect of share plans 000 5,353 8,888 Diluted weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings per share 000 332,881 343,632 Basic earnings per share pence 31.1 19.6 Diluted earnings per share pence 30.6 19.0 the above results relate to continuing operations.
Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the employee Benefit trust and held in the reserve.
Earnings per ordinary share continued Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
this calculation determines the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
the number of shares calculated in the basic earnings per share is then adjusted to reflect the number of shares deemed to be issued for nil consideration as a result of the potential exercise of existing share options.
the remaining share options that are currently not dilutive and hence excluded from the dilutive earnings per share calculation remain potentially dilutive until they are either exercised or they lapse.
Potential future ordinary share transactions It remains the Companys intention to use surplus cash to repurchase and cancel its shares.

the terminal value of the cash flow is then calculated by discounting using the Groups weighted average cost of capital 8%.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
an impairment loss is recognised as an expense.
the Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
It is the opinion of the Directors that at 1 December 007 there was no impairment of intangible assets.

the following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax assets 4,998 9,447 Deferred tax liabilities 17 4,981 9,447 at 1 December 007, unremitted earnings of overseas Group companies amounted to 78.6m 006: 0. m. unremitted earnings may be liable to some overseas and uK tax after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
however, no tax is expected to be payable due to the split of unremitted earnings between lower taxed jurisdictions and higher taxed jurisdictions.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 1. m 006: 0.8m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
these tax losses are available to offset future taxable profits in the respective jurisdictions.
all of the deferred tax asset for losses of 1.0m is dependent on generating future taxable profits.
of the recognised deferred tax asset, nil is recognised within territories that were loss making in the current year.

In accordance with these programmes, options are exercisable at the market price of the shares at the date of the grant.
two grants under the eSoS were made before 7 november 00. the recognition and measurement principles in IFrS have been applied to all grants after 7 november 00. they have not been applied to the two grants made prior to 7 november 00 in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFrS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial reporting Standards and IFrS Share-based payment.
at 1 December 007 the following options had been granted and remained outstanding in respect of the Companys ordinary shares of 1p under the Michael page executive Share option Scheme.
all options granted are settled by the physical delivery of shares.
the Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Balance at No.

In 006, options were granted on 7 March.
the estimated fair values of the options granted on that date was.
Called-up share capital continued Share options are granted under service and non-market performance conditions.
these conditions are not taken into account in the fair value measurement at grant date.
there are no market conditions associated with the share option grants other than those on the initial grant in 001. the options outstanding at 1 December 007 have an exercise price in the range of 81. pence to 9.
1 pence and a weighted average contractual life of 6.6 years.
the fair values of options granted during the year were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
the inputs into the model were as follows: Share Option Scheme Incentive Share Scheme Deferred Bonus Shares 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Share price 4.65 3.10 4.65 3.10 4.65 3.10 Average exercise price 4.65 3.10 Nil Nil Nil Nil Weighted average fair value 4.65 3.10 4.65 3.10 4.65 3.10 Expected volatility 30% 35% 30% 35% 30% 35% Expected life 5 years 5 years 3 years 3 years 2 years 3 years Risk free rate 5.00% 4.75% 5.00% 4.75% 5.00% 4.75% Expected dividend yield 1.25% 1.5% Nil Nil Nil Nil expected volatility was determined by reference to historical volatility of the Companys share price since flotation.
the expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
the Group recognised total expenses of 6.8m 006:.
m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during the year.
Option plan details note 1 pre flotation options on flotation, options over, 7 0,000 9% ordinary shares were granted to the executive Directors and 7 employees.
these options are subject to the following: a.
6% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that earnings per Share epS targets have been satisfied over a period of to 10 years.
none of these options will vest unless epS has grown in line with the uK retail prices Index rpI plus an average of % per annum.
at that point one third of this portion of the options vest.
If epS growth is higher than this level, vesting increases on a sliding scale basis until 100% of this portion of the options vest where epS growth matches rpI plus an average of 10% per annum.
the base earnings per share is 9.9p.
the results for the year ended 1 December 00 met the epS performance conditions for 8 % of the outstanding options.
the result for the year ended 1 December 006 met the epS performance conditions for the remaining 1 % of the outstanding options, these vested on 1 March 007. b.
% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satisfied over a period of at least years.
none of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 0% growth after years and not later than years.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 00% growth after years and not later than years.
these hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.
at 1 December 007, the performance conditions were met for 81.8% 006: 6.
% of the outstanding share price dependent options.
Called-up share capital continued note 2 Grants post flotation the respective base earnings per share for each grant are shown in the table on page 7.
For grants since 00, the performance condition is tested on the third anniversary and no retesting will occur thereafter.
these options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share of at least % per annum above the growth in the uK retail price Index.
all future grants of options under this scheme will be subject to similar epS performance conditions which is considered the best measure of the Groups performance and is designed to provide a direct link between the rewards for executives and the returns to shareholders, whilst at the same time ensuring that senior executives can measure the results of their efforts through the Companys share price.
Other share-based payment plans the Company also operates an Incentive Share plan for the executive Directors and senior employees and an annual Bonus plan for the executive Directors.
Details of these schemes are disclosed on pages and, and are settled by the physical delivery of shares, currently satisfied by shares held in the employee Benefit trust, to the extent that service and performance conditions are met.
Reserves Share premium the share premium account has been established to represent the excess of the exercise share price over the nominal value of the shares on the exercise of share options.
Capital redemption reserve the capital redemption reserve relates to the cancellation of the Companys own shares.
the increase in the year represents the nominal value of the 11, 1 shares cancelled during the year as shown in note 18.

a total of 1, 1, 0 shares have been allocated to satisfy share option awards made under the Incentive Share plan, and 9,98 deferred share option have been allocated under the annual Bonus plan.
Dividends on these shares are waived and are treated as non dilutive.
Following the allocation of awards made under the above mentioned plans, to date, 066,9 1 ordinary shares remain unallocated in the reserve.
Dividends on these shares are also waived and are treated as non dilutive.
Currency translation reserve the translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that are integral to the operations of the Company.
Cash flows from operating activities Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Profit before tax 147,441 96,959 721 6,665 Depreciation and amortisation charges 7,660 6,445 749 568 Loss profit on sale of property, plant and equipment, and computer software 91 48 Share scheme charges 6,757 4,168 Net finance cost 1,991 408 2,837 891 Operating cashflow before changes in working capital and provisions 163,940 107,932 4,307 8,124 Increase in receivables 40,863 42,376 73,230 318 Increase in payables 25,778 13,655 110,667 21,428 Decrease in provisions 192 384 Cash generated from operations 148,663 78,827 41,744 29,234 21.
Currently the main eurozone subsidiaries and the uK-based Group treasury subsidiary participate in this cash pool, although it is the Groups intention to extend the scope of the participation to other Group companies going forward.
the structure facilitates interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
this notional pooling does not meet the strict set-off rules under IFrS and as a result the cash and bank overdraft balances must be reported gross on the balance sheet.
on a netted pro forma basis, cash and cash equivalents and overdraft balances would have been 9. m lower, resulting in.
m cash and cash equivalents and 18.0m bank overdraft balances.
Financial risk management the Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: i credit risk ii liquidity risk iii market risk this note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
Financial risk management continued the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
the Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
the Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
the Group audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
the Group audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal audit.
Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit Committee.
i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from clients and investment securities.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
at the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
trade and other receivables total trade receivables net of allowances held by the Group at 1 December 007 amounted to 160.9m 006: 118. m. an initial credit period is made available on invoices.
no interest is charged on trade receivables from the date of the invoice during this credit period.
thereafter, interest is charged on the outstanding balance.
the Group has provided fully for all receivables over 1 0 days because historical experience is such that receivables past due beyond 1 0 days are generally not recoverable.
trade receivables below 1 0 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the provision of our services, determined by reference to past default experience.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 77.7m 006:.
9m that are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as the amounts are still considered recoverable.
the Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
the average age of these receivables is days in excess of the initial credit period 006: 1 days.
the aging of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Gross receivables Provision receivables Provision 2007 2007 2006 2006 000 000 000 000 Not past due 83,486 178 62,360 41 Past due 0-30 days 46,554 467 37,681 460 Past due 31-150 days 32,261 784 19,514 809 More than 150 days 2,304 2,304 1,960 1,960 164,605 3,733 121,515 3,270 the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each client.
the demographics of the Groups client base, including the country in which clients operate, also has an influence on credit risk.
less than % of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single client.
the geographic diversification of the Groups revenue also reduces the concentration of credit risk.
the majority of the Groups clients have been transacting with the Group for several years, with losses rarely occurring.
In monitoring client credit risk, clients are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including geographic location, industry, aging profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties.
Financial risk management continued movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2007 2006 000 000 Balance at beginning of the year 3,270 2,328 Impairment losses recognised on receivables 5,682 3,923 Amounts written off as uncollectable 1,244 431 Amounts recovered during the year 1,638 1,177 Impairment losses reversed 2,337 1,373 Balance at end of the year 3,733 3,270 the majority of the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 1.1m 006: 0.8m which have been placed in litigation, as well as a further provision for debts of 1 0 days and over.
the impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
Exposure to credit risk the maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 000 000 EMEA 84,324 53,964 United Kingdom 55,097 50,270 Asia Pacific 12,978 9,234 Americas 8,473 4,777 160,872 118,245 annual report 007 79 22.
Financial risk management continued the maximum exposure to credit risk for accrued income at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 000 000 EMEA 456 150 United Kingdom 14,195 12,108 Asia Pacific 4,729 3,387 Americas 1,963 852 21,343 16,497 the entire accrued income balance is not past due.
the fair values of trade and other receivables are not materially different to those disclosed above.
ii liquidity risk management ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework that aims to ensure that the Group has sufficient cash or credit facilities at all times to meet all current and forecast liabilities as they fall due.
It is the Directors intention to continue to finance the activities and development of the Group from retained earnings and to operate the Groups business while maintaining the net cash debt position within a relatively narrow band.
Cash surpluses are invested in short-term deposits, with any working capital requirements being provided from Group cash resources, Group facilities, or by local overdraft facilities.
Cash generated in excess of these requirements will be used to buy back the Companys shares.
the Group also operates a multi-currency notional cash pool to facilitate interest and balance compensation of cash and bank overdrafts.
the following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities.
Carrying amount Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2007 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 5,030 970 1,067 150 Accruals and other payables 51,725 24,257 19,061 4,023 Bank overdraft 47,433 Carrying amount Less than More than 1 month 1-3 months 3-12 months 12 months 2006 000 000 000 000 Trade payables 4,800 318 157 355 Accruals and other payables 40,065 7,118 21,177 2,815 Bank overdraft 43 iii market risk and sensitivity analysis the Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but these risks are not deemed to be material.
however, a sensitivity analysis showing hypothetical fluctuations in pounds Sterling against the Groups main exposure currencies is shown on pages 81 and 8. there has been no material change in the Groups exposure to market risks or the manner in which it manages and measures the risk.
For additional information on market risk, refer to treasury management and currency risk in the Financial review.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk management Borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
the Group does not consider this risk as significant.
the benchmark rates for determining floating rate liabilities are based on relevant national lIBor equivalents.
the average interest rates paid were as follows: 2007 2006 Bank overdrafts 6.40% 4.26% Bank loans 6.22% 5.40% Currency rate risk We publish our results in pounds Sterling and conduct our business in many foreign currencies.
as a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements.
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of some of our subsidiaries and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of our foreign subsidiaries.
the main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling, euro and australian Dollar.
the Group does not have material transactional currency exposures, nor is there a material exposure to foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
the Group is exposed to foreign currency translation differences in accounting for its overseas operations although our policy is not to hedge this exposure.
In certain cases, where the Group gives or receives short-term loans to and from other Group companies with different reporting currencies, it may use foreign exchange swap derivative financial instruments to manage the currency and interest rate exposure that arises on these loans.
It is the Groups policy not to seek to designate these derivatives as hedges.
Sensitivity analysis - currency risk a 10 percent strengthening of sterling against the following currencies at 1 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown on page 8. this analysis is applied currency by currency in isolation, i. e. ignoring the impact of currency correlation, and assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
the analysis is performed on the same basis for 006. the amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are forward-looking estimates of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
actual results in the future may differ materially from those projected, due to developments in the global financial markets which may cause fluctuations in interest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the table below, which therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events and losses.

a member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by him.. a proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting to represent you.
Your proxy will vote as you instruct and must attend the meeting for your vote to be counted.
Details of how to appoint the Chairman or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form.
appointing a proxy does not preclude you from attending the Meeting and voting in person.
If you attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.. a copy of this notice has been sent for information only to persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under section 1 6 of the Companies act 006 a nominated person.
the rights to appoint a proxy can not be exercised by a nominated person: they can only be exercised by the member.
however, a nominated person may have a right under an agreement between him and the member by whom he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the meeting or to have someone else so appointed.
If a nominated person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it, he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights..
In order to be valid an appointment of proxy must be returned together with any authority under which it is executed to the Companys registrars not less than 8 hours before the time of the meeting.. CreSt members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CreSt electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CreSt Manual.

the Company may treat as invalid a CreSt proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation a of the uncertificated Securities regulations 001.
Steve Ingham and Dr tim Miller will retire by rotation and are seeking reappointment at the annual General Meeting.
as ruby McGregor-Smith was first appointed to the Board by the Directors, in accordance with regulation 9a of the Companys articles of association, she is retiring and seeking re-appointment at the annual General Meeting.
Biographical information on each of the Directors is contained on pages 0 and 1 of the annual report and accounts.
For the purpose of this resolution, political donations, political organisations and political expenditure have the meanings given to them in Section 6 - 6 of the 006 act.
In accordance with its Business principles, it is the Companys policy not to make contributions to political parties.
there is no intention to change it.
however, what constitutes a political party, a political organisation, political donations or political expenditure under the Companies act 006 is not easy to decide as the legislation is capable of wide interpretation.
Sponsorship, subscriptions, payment of expenses, paid leave for employees fulfilling public duties, and support for bodies representing the business community in policy review or reform, among other things, may fall within this.
therefore, notwithstanding that the Company has no intention of making any political donation or incurring any political expenditure in respect of any political party, political organisation or independent election candidate, the Board has decided to put forward resolution 8 to grant the authority.
this will allow the Company to continue to support the community and put forward its views to wider business and Government interests without running the risk of being in breach of the law.
as permitted under the 006 act, resolution 8 has also been extended to cover any of these activities by the Companys subsidiaries.
8. this authority is in respect of % of the issued share capital of the Company and is in accordance with the recommendations of the association of British Insurers aBI.
It is the Directors intention to seek renewal of this authority annually.
the Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
there are currently no shares held as treasury Shares.
annual report 007 9 9. this authority is in respect of % of the issued share capital of the Company and is in accordance with the recommendations of the aBI.
It applies to both the issue of new shares and sales of shares out of treasury.
10. this authority is in respect of 1.
99% of the issued share capital of the Company and the power given by this resolution will only be exercised if the Directors are satisfied that any purchase will increase the earnings per Share of the ordinary Share Capital in issue after the purchase and accordingly, that the purchase is in the interests of shareholders.
It is the intention that shares purchased under this authority be cancelled, but in order to respond properly to the Companys capital requirements and prevailing market conditions, the directors will need to reassess at the time of any and each actual purchase whether to hold the shares in treasury or cancel them, provided it is permitted to do so.
11. to have the right to attend and vote at the meeting or adjourned meeting and also for the purpose of calculating how many votes a person may cast, a person must have his her name entered on the register of members by no later than 6.00pm on 1 May 008 or if the meeting is adjourned, at 6.00pm on the date which is two days prior to the adjourned meeting.
Changes to entries on the register after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote and the number of votes they may cast at the meeting or adjourned meeting.
1. the Company proposes to adopt new articles of association.
these incorporate amendments to the current articles of association to reflect the provisions of the Companies act 006 the 006 act which relate to directors conflicts of interest which will come into effect in october 008. as the 006 act will not be fully in force until october 009, and so it is not yet possible to fully reflect the 006 act changes, it is anticipated that shareholders will be asked to approve further changes to our articles of association at the 009 aGM.
the 006 act sets out directors general duties which largely codify the existing law but with some changes.
under the 006 act, from 1 october 008 a director has a statutory duty to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the companys interests.
the requirement is very broad and could apply, for example, if a director becomes a director of another company or a trustee of another organisation.
the 006 act allows directors of public companies to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate, if the articles of association contain a provision to this effect.
the 006 act also allows the articles to contain other provisions for dealing with directors conflicts of interest to avoid a breach of duty.
article 100, which is the provision for dealing with conflicts in our current articles, allowing directors to be interested in transactions and to be an officer of or employed by or interested in a body corporate in which the company is interested, has been amended so that it confirms that such interests, offices or employment will not infringe the conflicts duty as codified in the 006 act.
new article 101 gives the directors authority to approve conflict situations including other directorships held by the companys directors and include other provisions to allow conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a similar way to the current position.
there are safeguards that will apply when directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or potential conflict.
First, only directors who have no interest in the matter being considered will be able to take the relevant decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the directors must act in a way they consider, in good faith, will be most likely to promote the companys success.
the directors will be able to impose limits or conditions when giving authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
the proposed new article 101 also contains provisions relating to confidential information, attendance at board meetings and availability of board papers to protect a director from being in breach of duty if a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest arises.
these provisions will only apply where the position giving rise to the potential conflict has previously been authorised by the directors.
It is the boards intention to report annually on the Companys procedures for ensuring that the boards powers of authorisation of conflicts are operated effectively and that the procedures have been followed.
In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that i if a corporate shareholder has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to the Chairman and the Chairman will vote or withhold a vote as corporate representative in accordance with those directions: and ii if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate representative.
Corporate shareholders are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and administrators on proxies and corporate representatives www.
