16 Financial Instruments i Management of Risk As an investment trust, the Groups investment objective is to seek capital growth from a portfolio of securities drawn from markets both within the UK and worldwide.
The holding of these financial instruments to meet this objective results in certain risks.
The Groups financial instruments comprise: 1.
Securities in unquoted and quoted companies, and partnership interests.
A loan facility, the purpose of which is to finance tender offers, other share buy-backs and on-market purchases of shares, the financing of new investment and refinancing existing debt.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are fluctuations in market price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
The policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review and the preceding year.
55 Electra Private Equity PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Accounts Notes to the Accounts Accounts 16 Financial Instruments continued Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements, mitigated by stock selection.
The Group does not use derivatives.
Electra Partners has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through retained profits including both realised and unrealised capital profits.
In addition, financing is obtained through loan facilities.
During the year, a long-term multi-currency loan facility was in existence.
The loan has a floating rate of interest.

Liquidity Risk The Groups assets comprise listed and unlisted equity and non-equity shares and fixed income securities.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the revolving loan facility.

The treatment of foreign currency transactions has been described in greater detail in the basis of accounting note commencing on page 43.
