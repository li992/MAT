7 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted average Earnings Weighted average number of number of ordinary ordinary shares shares 2007 2007 2006 2006 000 no.

The amendments have not had any impact on the financial statements for the year ended 31 July 2007.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company is liable, jointly and severally with other members of the Group, under guarantees given to the Group's bankers in respect of overdrawn balances on certain Group bank accounts and in respect of other overdrafts, loans and guarantees given by the banks to or on behalf of other Group undertakings.
The Company has given performance and other trade guarantees on behalf of subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has guaranteed the overdrafts of associated undertakings up to a maximum of 6,000,000 2006 - 6,000,000.

The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities has been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
The expected long-term rates of return are as follows: 2007 2006 2005 % per annum % per annum % per annum Equities 6.50 6.50 6.50 Bonds 5.00 5.00 5.00 Cash 5.00 4.00 4.00 Overall for scheme 5.90 5.90 5.90 Actual return of Scheme assets The actual return on the Scheme assets over the year ending 31 July 2007 was 8.5%.

Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Notes to the Accounts 23 Employee benefits continued Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, an annual bonus scheme, employee share ownership schemes ESOS and Savings Related Share Option Schemes SROS all of which are detailed below.
IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP and the annual bonus scheme have been made to executive directors and the company secretary.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under the scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
Vesting of options under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies, as detailed on page 44 within the Report of the Board on Director's Remuneration.
With regard to the annual bonus scheme, for awards up to and including those for the year ended 31 July 2006, one half is payable in November each year following the announcement of the Group's annual results.
The other half is used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employee's name.
In addition, various small share awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees mainly at divisional management level.
These awards mainly had three year vesting periods.
Awards to executive directors and to the company secretary in relation to the year ended 31 July 2007, and subsequent years, are made in cash with no compulsory deferral element.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.
Reconciliations of share options outstanding and weighted average exercise prices for each type of share option are shown below: Number of Number of share options share options 2007 2006 LTIP Outstanding at the beginning of the year 456,213 338,290 Granted during the year 91,517 117,923 Forfeited during the year - - Lapsed during the year 61,593 - Exercised during the year 130,286 - Outstanding at the end of the year 355,851 456,213 Exercisable at the end of the year - - The options outstanding at 31 July 2007 had a weighted average remaining life of 0.8 years.

83 Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2007 continued Notes to the Accounts 23 Employee benefits continued Share-based payments continued Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Group's performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
The inputs into the Monte Carlo model for the various grants under the LTIP were as follows: January November November October 2004 2004 2005 2006 Grant date 19 Jan 2004 30 Nov 2004 14 Nov 2005 18 Oct 2006 Risk free interest rate - - - - Exercise price - - - - Share price at date of grant 667.5p 712p 999p 1,372p Expected dividend yield 3.00% 3.00% 2.90% 2.40% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Date of vesting 19 Jan 2007 30 Nov 2007 14 Nov 2008 18 Oct 2009 Expected volatility 25% 25% 25% 25% Fair value of option 343.0p 292.0p 480.0p 676.4p The inputs into the simplified Black Scholes model used for the shares issued under the annual bonus scheme were as follows: May November October November October February 2003 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Grant date 31 May 2003 18 Nov 2003 26 Oct 2004 14 Nov 2005 18 Oct 2006 7 Feb 2007 Exercise price ------ Share price at date of grant 575.5p 621.5p 675p 999p 1,372p 1,542p Expected dividend yield ------ Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Date of vesting 31 May 2006 18 Nov 2006 26 Oct 2007 18 Nov 2008 18 Oct 2009 7 Feb 2010 Fair value of option 575.5p 621.5p 675p 999p 1,372p 1,542p 84 Bellway p. l. c.

As a result of the adoption of IFRIC 8 the comparatives within the parent company financial statements have been restated.
