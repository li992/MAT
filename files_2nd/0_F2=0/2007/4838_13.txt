22 DSG international plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Business and Financial Review Dividends The directors have proposed a final dividend of 6.85 pence per share 2005 06 6.53 pence, an increase of 5 per cent.
Subject to shareholder approval at the annual general meeting on 5 September, it will be paid on 28 September 2007 to shareholders registered on 24 August 2007.
This gives total dividends for the year of 8.87 pence 2005 06 8.45 pence, an increase of 5 per cent.
The Groups policy is to increase dividends in line with earnings over time: however, in the short term, this will be balanced against rebuilding dividend cover.
Consolidated Balance Sheet Consolidated net assets decreased to 1,304.3 million from 1,423.7 million at 29 April 2006.
The main movements comprised an increase of 206.6 million generated from underlying post tax profits which were offset by non-underlying items of 204.2 million as set out in the income statement on page 63.
Net assets were further enhanced by actuarial gains of 45.7 million arising from the UK defined benefit pension scheme as well as 20.8 million from the issue of shares to satisfy employee options.
These increases were offset by foreign exchange movements of 24.5 million and dividends in the period of 157.0 million.
Tax The Groups tax rate on underlying profit was 30 per cent 2005 06 28.8 per cent.
The increase in the tax rate reflects the reduced benefit of lower overseas tax rates.
Cost savings In the period, the Group delivered 25 million of cost savings and is targeting further savings of 25 million for 2007 08.
Of these initiatives, the outsourcing of the Groups IS service and the reorganisation of the logistics infrastructure are delivering savings over a number of years as follows: The outsourcing of the IS services will save the Group approximately 10 million per annum.
As a result of the phasing of this contract the Group realised 5 million of this during the 2006 07 financial year.
The full benefits of this contract are expected to be realised during the 2007 08 financial year.
The reorganisation of the Groups logistics infrastructure in the UK and in Italy is expected to save approximately 20 million per annum.
This is a significant change programme over a number of years, and is expected to be completed during the first quarter of the new financial year.
In 2006 07, 5 million of this benefit was realised as the changes were implemented.
In 2007 08, this is expected to rise to 15 million with the full benefits being realised in the 2008 09 financial year.
The balance of the cost savings initiatives are being delivered from a number of areas within the Group including a programme to rationalise the retail support functions.
Pensions At 28 April 2007, excluding deferred tax benefits, the deficit of the UK defined benefit pension scheme amounted to 38.4 million 29 April 2006 141.7 million.
Including deferred tax benefits, the deficit amounted to 17.0 million 29 April 2006 99.8 million.
The Group has been implementing a programme of changes to pension arrangements in order to address the deficit over the longer term.
These have included the gradual increase in the Group contribution rate which is currently 12.9 per cent and the change of benefits to operate on a career average earnings basis rather than final salary for future service.
The deficit has mainly been reduced by a special contribution made by the Group of 50.0 million in March 2007 coupled with a significant increase in the discount rate applied to liabilities in the period which reflects returns on long term gilts.
The charge to operating profit for the scheme was 11.8 million 2005 06 18.3 million and includes the one off benefit of 4.7 million relating to the change in legislation concerning lump sum payments allowed on retirement.
Also included in the income statement is a net financing income of 4.5 million 2005 06 cost of 0.6 million which represents the expected return on assets of the scheme, based on market conditions prevailing at the start of the financial period, offset by the unwinding of the discount applied to the liabilities of the scheme.
The defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 September 2002.
Going concern After making due enquiry, on the basis of current financial projections and borrowing facilities available, the directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
