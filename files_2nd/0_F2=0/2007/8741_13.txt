In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The Company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, based on expected future trading pattern.
The discount rate employed is the Companys estimated weighted average cost of capital before tax and reflects the relevant risks of the assets being tested for impairment.
The resultant impairment losses in 2006 07 were 876,000 as shown in the table above.

In respect of the NDSO and 2001 scheme, options are exercisable three years after they have been granted and only if the Companys normalised earnings per share excluding exceptional items, over any three-year period, have exceeded the growth in the RPI by an average of at least 3% per annum.
As the AESOP plan and the SAYE scheme are available to all staff, there are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of options under them.
