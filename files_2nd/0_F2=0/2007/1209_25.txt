Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 General Information Aricom plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is 1011 Grosvenor Place, London SW1X 7HH.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors report on pages 55 to 63.
2 Change in Functional Currency In prior periods, Aricom plc had determined that its functional currency was US dollars.
During the year, the Company raised a significant amount of funds by way of a placing of ordinary shares and warrants in the UK market.
Not only are these denominated in GB pounds with any dividends payable in GB pounds, but they also represent a strategic decision to raise funding in GB pounds on this occasion.
Accordingly the Directors found it necessary to reconsider the Companys functional currency and, as a consequence, have determined that the functional currency of the Company has changed to GB pounds.
The accounts continue to be presented in US dollars to aid comparison with other global mining companies.
3 Adoption of New and Revised Standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital see note 44.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue and endorsed by the European Union, but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 11 IFRS2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the primary financial statements of the Group.
The impact of IFRS 8 on the choice of segments has yet to be determined.
4 Restatement of Comparatives During the current year the Directors have re-assessed the accounting treatment of the deferred consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of KS GOK in the 31 December 2006 balance sheet.
This has no effect on the value attributed to the asset, the loss for the year or the cash flows reported in the published 2006 Financial Statements.
The deferred consideration in relation to the first 50% interest in KS GOK acquired from Malavasia Enterprises Inc. comprised ordinary shares, at an amount dependent on the outcome of the valuation.
Therefore, the consideration has now been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment as an equity-settled share-based payment and been classified as equity shares to be issued rather than as a current liability as previously reported.
This increased reported net assets as at 31 December 2006 by US$83.8 million.
These ordinary shares were issued during the current year, and hence this balance is no longer recognised at the balance sheet date.
5 Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and the treatment of share-based payments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries as at the balance sheet date.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination or acquisition of ore deposits by way of a corporate vehicle, and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against interests of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business Combinations and Goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Purchases of a Minority Interest in a Controlled Entity The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, at the date of exchange, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for shares purchased in a controlled entity, plus any costs directly attributable to the transaction.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a controlled entity are recognised at fair value at the date of the exchange transaction, but only to the extent of the proportion of equity acquired.
Goodwill arising on the purchase of shares in a controlled entity is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the additional cost of shares over the increase of Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If the increase in Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the shares purchase, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of Assets Frequently, the acquisition of mining licences is effected through a non-operating corporate structure.
As these structures do not represent a business, it is considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination.
Accordingly the transaction is accounted for as the acquisition of an asset.
The net assets acquired are recognised at cost.
Where the Group has full control but does not own 100% of the assets, then a minority interest is recognised at an equivalent amount based on the Groups cost, the assets continue to be carried at cost and changes in those values are recognised in equity.

These intangibles are measured at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is a period of up to 10 years, but dependent upon the start-up date of the titanium sponge plant.
Investments in Associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but does not control or have joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by postacquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill within the investment.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for the impairment.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Revenue from engineering contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on engineering contracts, as set out below.
Revenue from rental income is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on leasing, as set out below.
Engineering Contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
The stage of completion is measured by reference to estimates of work performed to date.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as Lessor Equipment and other assets may be leased to contractors under an operating lease, for use in the construction of mining properties.
Amounts due from lessees under these operating leases are set off against the cost of construction in the period to which they relate.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued The Group as Lessee Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see below.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Foreign Currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in United States dollars, which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in the income statement for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the income statement for the year.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and other derivatives see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
For the purpose of preparing consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups operations which have a functional currency other than GB pounds are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised within equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements in US dollars, the assets and liabilities of the Group are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expensed in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.
Retirement Benefit Costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
74 Aricom plc Annual Report 2007 A Ar riic co om m p pllc c A An nn nu ua all R Re ep po or rt t 2 20 00 07 7 7 75 5 Financial Statements 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenditure The costs of exploration properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring prospective properties and exploration rights, are capitalised as intangible assets.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is capitalised within exploration and evaluation properties until such time that the activities have reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially exploitable reserves when they are transferred to mining properties and leases.
Capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is assessed for impairment in accordance with the indicators of impairment as set out in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Reserves.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the year.
Property, Plant and Equipment Mining Properties and Leases The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights are classified as tangible assets from the time that a resource estimate is available and it is the Groups intention to exploit the value of the property through the development and production of the available resource.
Pre-production expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit of production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or Group of properties.
Commercial reserves are proven and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Mining properties and leases are reviewed for impairment annually and any impairment charge is taken to the income statement accordingly.
For open pit operations the removal of overburden and waste materials, referred to as stripping, is required to obtain access to the orebody.
Such costs when incurred prior to the commencement of production are deferred on the balance sheet, and charged to operating profit over the life of mine.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued Other Property, Plant and Equipment Other property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all such property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life or the life of the relevant licence, whichever is less, as follows: Average life in years Buildings 50 Plant and machinery 720 Office equipment 310 Computer equipment 46 Until they are brought into use, fixed assets and equipment to be installed are included within assets under construction.
The cost of maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of tangible fixed assets are charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Renewals and asset improvements are capitalised.
Upon sale or retirement of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the financial statements.
Any resulting gains or losses are included in the income statement.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs An obligation to incur site restoration and rehabilitation costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mining property.
Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged against profits over the life of the mine, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Depreciation is included in operating costs while the unwinding of the discount is included as financing costs.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work are added to, or deducted from, the cost of the related asset in the current period.
Inventories Inventories and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on the following bases: Raw materials and consumables are valued at cost on a first-in-first-out FIFO basis: Finished products ready for sale are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
76 Aricom plc Annual Report 2007 A Ar riic co om m p pllc c A An nn nu ua all R Re ep po or rt t 2 20 00 07 7 7 77 7 Financial Statements 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Assets Financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale financial assets and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
The Group does not hold any financial assets which meet the definition of available-for-sale financial asset.
Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss Financial assets are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL where the Group acquires the financial asset principally for the purpose of selling in the near term, the financial asset is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking as well as all derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss includes any dividend or interest earned on the financial asset.
Effective Interest Method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset, or where appropriate, a shorter period.
Loans and Receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of Financial Assets Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL or available-for-sale, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For loans and receivables the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs.
Other investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the year.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the year.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for debt instruments classified as available-forsale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Financial Liabilities and Equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 5 Significant Accounting Policies continued Financial Liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities.
Financial Liabilities at FVTPL Financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL where the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL.
A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: it has been incurred principally for the purpose of disposal in the near future: or it is a part of an identified portfolio of financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent actual pattern of shortterm profit-taking: or it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedge instrument.
A financial liability other than a financial liability held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if: such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise: or the financial liability forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Groups documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the Group is provided internally on that basis: or it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement permits the entire combined contract asset or liability to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
The net gain or loss recognised in profit or loss incorporates any interest paid on the financial liability.
Other Financial Liabilities Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Trade Payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity Instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative Financial Instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group has not presently applied the hedge accounting provisions of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of derivative financial are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Share-based Payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees and under various contracts with third parties.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest, adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.

The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled, share-based payments.
Employee Benefit Trust The carrying value of shares held by the employee benefit trust are recorded as own shares, shown as a deduction to shareholders equity.
6 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 5, management has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Impairment of Assets The Group reviews the carrying value of its intangible assets and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
In making assessments for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash flows are allocated to an appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The recoverable amount of those assets, or CGU, is measured at the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets to CGUs, in estimating the probability, timing and value of underlying cash flows and in selecting appropriate discount rates to be applied within the value in use calculation.
Subsequent changes to CGU allocation or estimates and assumptions in the value in use calculation could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Provision for Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs As explained in the accounting policy note, costs arising from site restoration works, and the decommissioning of plant, discounted to their present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
The provision is based on estimates prepared by external consultants.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for these costs.
The ultimate costs of site restoration and decommissioning are uncertain, and cost estimates can vary in response to many factors including changes to relevant legal requirements, the emergence of new restoration techniques or experience at other mine sites.
The expected timing and extent of expenditure can also change, for example in response to changes in ore reserves or processing levels.
As a result, there could be significant adjustments to the provisions established which would affect future financial results.
Assumptions Related to the Valuation of Share-based Payments In order to value options granted, the Group has made judgements as to the volatility of its own ordinary shares, the probable life of the options granted and the time of exercise of those options.
The Company has also made a judgement as to which methodology to use in valuing the options in each case.
Fair Value of Property on Acquisition The fair value of property on acquisition of a subsidiary during the year ended 31 December 2007 was established on the basis of the Directors assessment as detailed in note 38.
Estimation of Percentage Completion of Engineering Contracts at Giproruda To estimate the percentage completion of engineering contracts and therefore determine the amount of contract revenue and associated costs to recognise requires that management makes an assessment of the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
The Directors consider that these estimates are made by suitably qualified project managers.
Tax provisions Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgments to be made regarding the result of negotiations with and enquiries from tax authorities in a number of jurisdictions.
The assessments made are based on advice from independent tax advisers and the status of ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.

31 December 2006 As referred to in note 17, on 30 June 2006 the Group disposed of its interest in LLC Chemelt.
The net assets of LLC Chemelt at the date of disposal were as follows: On disposal 30 June 2006 US$000 Property, plant and equipment 3 Inventories 893 Trade receivables 1,482 Bank balances and cash 311 Trade payables 761 Short-term loans 1,216 Loans owed to the Group 735 23 Minority interest in Chemelt-East 2 Gain on disposal 45 Total consideration 20 Satisfied by: Deferred consideration Cash 20 20 Net cash outflow arising on disposal: Cash consideration 20 Cash and cash equivalents disposed of 311 291 38 Acquisitions Acquisition of Minority Interest in Olekminsky Rudnik On 11 January 2007 the Group acquired the 26% interest in Olekminsky Rudnik that it did not already own, taking its interest in the Kuranakh project to 100%.
The purchase price of US$11 million was paid in January 2007.
It was concluded that the US$11 million paid reflected the fair value of 26% of the Kuranakh project.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy for acquiring minority interests, the percentage of the assets and liabilities acquired has been recognised at this fair value, resulting in an US$12.1 million increase in the carrying value of Kuranakh.
Acquisition of Minority Interest in KS GOK On 4 April 2007, the Company notified Philotus that it wanted to exercise the option to purchase the 50% interest in KS GOK it did not already own.
Following the receipt of FAS approval, on 9 August 2007 the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in KS GOK, in consideration for the issue of 123,782,467 ordinary shares to Philotus.
The number of ordinary shares issued was determined in accordance with the option agreement, and approved by the independent Directors, following a valuation report from WAI.
The cost of the net assets acquired at this date was considered to be the fair value determined as at 20 April 2007, this being the date of the settlement of the deferred consideration outstanding with respect to the acquisition of the first 50% controlling interest in KS GOK, which closely followed the date the Company served notice to Philotus in respect of the exercise of the option to acquire the remaining 50% interest.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 38 Acquisitions continued The total consideration for the acquisition of the 50% interest held by Philotus was comprised of the following: US$000 Cash consideration 9,000 Issue of an option to Philotus 9,200 Issue of 123,782,467 ordinary shares in Aricom to Philotus at market value 0.52 131,077 149,277 Following the completion of the acquisition of this asset in August 2007, the difference between the cost of the net assets acquired, determined as at 20 April 2007, based on the agreed number of shares to be issued and the share price at that date, and the fair value of the purchase consideration based on the share price when the shares were actually issued, has been recognised in equity.
Following the acquisition of this 50% interest, the Company now indirectly holds a 100% interest in KS GOK.
The net impact of the acquisition of this 50% interest was the recognition of a credit of $41.4 million to equity.
Acquisition of Garinskoye Deposit On 24 September 2007, Aricom UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Aricom, subscribed for ordinary shares in Lapwing, pursuant to an agreement dated 29 March 2007.
Lapwing Limited is the holding company that owns LLC Garinskiy Mining & Metallurgical Complex GGMK or Garinskiy, the company which holds the licence to develop and exploit the Garinskoye iron ore deposit in the Amur region of Russia.
At the time of this subscription, Aricom UK expected to obtain a 60% ownership interest in Lapwing, and additional subscriptions were required to be made by Aricom UKs co-shareholders at the same price.
There were expected to be four further shareholders in Lapwing, namely Olis with 25% and three other shareholders with the remaining 15% the Additional Holders.
The Additional Holders did not subscribe for any additional shares and consequently their interest in Lapwing was diluted to a total of 0.52% with Aricom UK holding 70.22% and Olis holding 29.26%.
Consideration for the acquisition of this asset was the settlement of a loan issued by the Group to Lapwing for 20.22 million, in exchange for 20,220,000 shares at 1 each in Lapwing and it was accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination.
Under the same agreement, Aricom UK acquired for a premium of US$19.7 million an option to purchase a further 25% interest.
The exercise period of the option was two years from the date of subscription but could be shortened in certain circumstances.
As outlined in note 46, this option was terminated in December 2007, and the original terms varied under an agreement dated 13 December 2007, as amended the Acquisition Agreement.
Under this Acquisition Agreement, Olis conditionally agreed to sell to Aricom its entire 29.26% interest in Lapwing, the acquisition was subject to Aricom obtaining Shareholders approval.
Aricom Shareholders approval was obtained on 15 February 2008 and the 29.26% interest in Lapwing was acquired on the same date.

A cash consideration of $8,148,000 was paid and transfer of ownership was effected on 8 June 2007.
Gipropruda is a highly respected Russian engineering company based in St Petersburg specialising in non-precious metals mine and processing plant design.
Russian legislation limited the Groups voting power until such time that the Russian Federal Financial Market Service approved Aricoms mandatory offer to minority shareholders.
Accordingly, Giproruda was recognised as an associate between 8 June and 12 July 2007.
On 13 July 2007, the Group obtained the full voting rights in respect of its 68.49% interest in Giproruda after a mandatory offer to minority shareholders was made in accordance with Russian legislation.
Subsequent to this date Giproruda is considered to be a subsidiary of Aricom.
Set out in the table below is a summary of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired in the business combination.

The Directors consider that these fair values substantially reflect the fair values of the net assets acquired as at 13 July 2007, the date at which the mandatory offer to minority shareholders was made and the Group received full voting rights.
No goodwill arose on acquisition as the consideration payable was equal to Aricoms share of the fair value of the net assets acquired.
The fair value of the net assets includes the Directors valuation of the Companys interest in the property that Giproruda occupies.
On 21 September 2007, the mandatory offer to minority shareholders lapsed.
A total of 2,073 shares were tendered under the offer, at a total cost of US$232,000.
The majority of the shares tendered were purchased by 1 October 2007, increasing the Groups interest in Giproruda to 70.28% from 68.49%.

uk Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 39 Business Combinations continued In accordance with the Groups accounting policy for acquiring minority interests, the percentage of the assets and liabilities acquired should be recognised at their value.
A fair value exercise was undertaken at 1 October 2007, and there was no significant change in the fair values of the net assets acquired, in comparison to the fair values set out above.
Giproruda added US$4,938,000 revenue and US$1,224,000 positive contribution to the Groups loss before tax for the period between the date of the business combination and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Giproruda had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the period would have been US$7,938,000 and profit attributable to equity holders of US$1,266,000.

The first action the Amur action was filed in a commercial court in Amur Region of Russia where the Garinskoye deposit is located.
The second action the Moscow action was filed in a commercial court in Moscow where Rosnedra, the authority which issued the Licence, is located.
Rosnedra is named as a defendant in both actions: Garinskiy is named as defendant in the Amur action and as an interested party in the Moscow action.

The Claimant appealed this decision, however on 28 January 2008 the Moscow court of appeal upheld the decision of the court of first instance.
Therefore, the claims of LLC AREK Geologiya to challenge the tender results were rejected.
This decision may be appealed within two months from the date of the decision.
Initially, the Amur action was suspended pending the outcome of the Moscow action.
After the decision in the Moscow action the Amur action was revived and the Company expects that the decision in the Amur action will follow the decision in the Moscow action.
The Company believes that the Claimants claims are of a limited merit and that therefore these proceedings do not represent a material threat to the Garinskoye licence or the Group.
42 Share-based Payments Equity-settled Directors Share Option Scheme The Company has a share option scheme for Directors of the Group.
These options over ordinary shares were issued in accordance with the Aricom plc Share Option Scheme.
Options granted under the Share Option Scheme are not subject to performance criteria.
Options are normally forfeited if the employee leaves the Group.
There have been no variations to the terms and conditions or performance criteria for share options during the period.
No further options over ordinary shares will be granted under the Share Option Scheme.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows.
On 8 January 2007, Thomas Swithenbank exercised 850,000 options, at an exercise price of 0.15 when the share price was 0.5875.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For options issued after the Companys ordinary shares were admitted to trading on AIM, the volatility of the ordinary shares has been computed by calculating the standard deviation of the return index on a daily basis by reference to the expected time for exercising the option.
This was achieved using the historic price of the quoted ordinary shares over a comparable period.
An exception to this was the employee options granted on 19 July when the historical period of share prices was restricted to the period for which the Group was listed on AIM ie 2 years 7 months and 18 days.
The Group recognised total expenses of US$603,000 in 2007 2006: US$429,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Cash-settled Long Term Incentive Plan and Employee Benefit Trust During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group established LTIP to operate in conjunction with EBT, which holds ordinary shares in the Company for the benefit of employees the participants.
In October 2007, the EBT subscribed for 16 million ordinary shares in the Company, at a price of 0.62 per share 9,920,000.
The acquisition of these ordinary shares by the EBT was funded via a loan made by Aricom Treasury UK Limited to the EBT.
The loan is due for repayment in October 2017, or any other date agreed between the parties.
Of the ordinary shares held by the EBT, 11 million have been allocated under the LTIP to Directors and members of senior management.
The LTIP has a qualification period of three years and a number of non-market performance related conditions which need to be satisfied for the LTIP to vest.
The ordinary shares in the Company will be held by the EBT on behalf of the participants for the vesting period, and should the Remuneration Committee advise the Trustees that the LTIP objectives have been successfully achieved, the ordinary shares will be sold, and any gains from this sale net of repaying the loan to Aricom Treasury UK Limited will be passed on to the participants.

There was no impact on the Income Statement as the cost of the options granted to Philotus has been taken to the cost of investment in the option which Aricom held over Philotuss stake in KS GOK.
The application of IFRS 2 resulted in an expense of US$429,000 being recognised in the year ended 31 December 2006, as well as the capitalisation of US$9.2 million in the value of the Philotus option relating to the fair value of the option issued to Philotus.

Financial Risk Management Objectives The Board of Directors monitors the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
These risks include market risk primarily currency and interest rate risk and credit risk.
Foreign Currency Risk Management The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk associated with fluctuations in the relative value of US Dollars, GB Pounds and Russian Roubles.
These risks are mitigated to the extent considered necessary by the Board of Directors through a combination of holding the relevant currencies and entering into forward contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2007 2006 2007 2006 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US dollars 81,458 n a 1,624 n a Russian roubles 57,634 14,449 8,622 9,995 GB pounds n a 89 n a 417 104 Aricom plc Annual Report 2007 A Ar riic co om m p pllc c A An nn nu ua all R Re ep po or rt t 2 20 00 07 7 1 10 05 5 Financial Statements 44 Financial Instruments continued Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis The Group is mainly exposed to Russian roubles and US dollars.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 5% change in GB pounds 2006: US Dollars against the respective foreign currencies.
The 5% rate represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign currency rates.
US dollars Rouble GB pound currency impact currency impact currency impact 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 Profit or loss 3,009 n a 1,856 579 2 12 The Groups sensitivity to foreign currency has increased during the current year mainly due to the increased holdings in cash equivalents and liquid short-term investments denominated in Russian roubles.
The Groups policy is to hold a portion of its cash equivalents and short-term investments in roubles to cover its exposure arising on capital and operational expenditure incurred in Russian roubles.
The Groups increased sensitivity to GB pound currency exposure during the period also relates to increased cash equivalent holdings which are denominated in GB pounds.
Currency Derivatives The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
There were no forward foreign currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
At 31 December 2006, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was US$15 million.
The fair value of the Groups currency derivatives was an asset of US$274,000.
This was based on the difference between the forward rate at 31 December 2006 and the exchange rate locked in under the foreign currency forward contracts.
These foreign currency derivatives have not been designated as hedges.
Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these foreign currency derivatives of US$274,000 was taken to the income statement in the year ended 31 December 2006.
Interest Rate Risk Management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the holding of cash and cash equivalents, and short-term financial asset investments, comprised of monies invested into money market funds and fixed coupon bonds.
The interest rates attached to these instruments are at floating rates.
The Group also holds amounts on deposit with fixed rates of interest attached.
The mix between fixed and floating rate financial assets limits the Groups interest rate risk.
The Groups exposure to interest rates on these financial assets is detailed in the interest rate sensitivity section of this note.
Interest Rate Sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for the average balance of interest bearing financial asset investments held during the year.
A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates has been applied in this analysis, which represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 would increase decrease by US$3,380,000 2006: loss reported would decrease increase by US$812,000.
Credit Risk Management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are monitored by the Board of Directors, and limits have been established to ensure that the aggregate value of transactions is spread amongst approved counterparties.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, financial asset investments and trade receivables.
Cash equivalents and financial asset investments represent investments in money market and liquidity investment funds, and amounts held on deposit with financial institutions.
The credit risk on liquid funds held in current accounts and available on demand is limited because our counterparties are generally banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The credit risk on money market and liquidity investment funds is limited because the counterparties are investment funds with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
These investment funds are managed in accordance with approved investment criteria, requiring that investments have certain credit ratings and limiting the concentration of investment in any one security.
