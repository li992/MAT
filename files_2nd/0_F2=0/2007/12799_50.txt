Options may be exercised within six months of the maturity of the contract.
This scheme was introduced during the period ended 17 August 2002 with a further invitation to join during the period ended 23 August 2003.
There were no options granted under this scheme in the period ended 18 August 2007 or period ended 19 August 2006.

These options vest after a three year performance period, with performance targets set by the Remuneration Committee, and are then exercisable for a period of seven years.
Performance targets for options granted on 31 January 2006 and 16 November 2005 are set on a sliding scale of earnings per share growth with 40% of options vesting on growth of RPI 8% per annum up to 100% vesting on growth of RPI 10% per annum.

Long Term Incentive Plan The third scheme is a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP whereby senior management will receive conditional rights over ordinary shares in the Company.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to the issue of a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are shown in the Report on Directors remuneration.
At 18 August 2007 eligible employees hold rights over ordinary shares which may result in the issue of 207,833 shares on 18 November 2007, 237,866 shares on 16 November 2008, 51,635 shares on 31 January 2009 and 468,544 shares on 13 November 2009.

Share Incentive Plan The fifth scheme is a Share Incentive Plan SIP open to all eligible employees, whereby proceeds contributed by employees are used to buy shares in the Company at prevailing market values.
These shares are called Partnership Shares and are held in a trust on behalf of the employee.
For every Partnership Share bought by the employee the Company will give the employee one share free of charge Matching Share.
The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Group and will not be entitled to the Matching Share if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
If the Company awards dividends to its shareholders, the employee will receive a dividend on each of the Partnership and Matching Shares they hold.
The Company arranges for the dividends to be used to buy extra shares Dividend Shares.
Dividend Shares must be held in the plan for three years before they can be removed unless the employee leaves the Group in which case they must be taken out.
The scheme was introduced in June 2004 with shares being acquired at market values on an annual or monthly basis.
As at 18 August 2007 160,661 shares August 2006: 134,204 shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.
The par value of the shares issued which has been deducted from reserves is negligible.
The market value of these shares at 18 August 2007 was 1.6m August 2006: 1.2m.
Fair value of share awards The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award.
Discretionary Share Plan There were no awards made in relation to the Discretionary Share Plan during the period.
The key assumptions for awards made in the previous period are detailed below: 31 January 16 November Grant date 2006 2005 Valuation model Binomial Binomial Share price at date of grant 8.66 7.67 Shares under option 64,257 149,996 Vesting period 3 years 3 years Expected volatility 27.30% 23.29% Expected life 5 years 5 years Risk free rate 4.2958% 4.3127% Expected dividend yield 1.64% 1.64% Expectation of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% Fair value per option 2.34 2.14 Expected volatility has been calculated based on the historic volatility of the Companys share price corresponding to the expected life of the option or share award.
The expected term of the options is based on the life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historically evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
Long Term Incentive Plan The fair value of awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan in the year have been determined using the beta valuation model taking into account the TSR performance condition attached to the awards and the expected dividend yield.
The estimated fair value of the awards made in the year is 6.18 for those awarded on 13 November 2006 3.83 for those awarded on 16 November 2005 and 4.34 for those awarded on 31 January 2006.
These fair values are based on an expected dividend yield of 0.85% August 2006: 1.64%.
Share Incentive Plan The fair value of the Matching Shares issued under the Companys Share Incentive Plan is recognised as the market value of the shares issued at the date of purchase.
This charge is spread over the three year vesting period on a straight line basis.
Deferred Share Bonus Plan The estimated fair value of the deferred bonus shares awarded in the year is determined based on the market value of shares on the date of grant discounted by the expected dividend yield.
The estimated fair value of shares granted in the year, under this scheme, is 11.13 August 2006: 7.36 based on an expected dividend yield of 0.85% August 2006: 1.64%.
