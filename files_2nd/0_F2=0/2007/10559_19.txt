NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies The Morgan Crucible Company plc the Company is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 100 to 106.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Group financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors, in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 28. a Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: derivative financial instruments and financial instruments available-for-sale.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initial recognised at cost.
The Groups investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses and equity movements of associates, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest is reduced to nil and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Groups interest in the associate.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
c Foreign currency i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to sterling at an average rate for the period where this approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation since the adoption of IFRS are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
iii Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and of related hedges are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal.
d Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged see accounting policy e. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
66 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies continued e Hedging i Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
When the forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in the hedging reserve are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in the hedging reserve and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in the hedging reserve is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to hedge economically the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
iii Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
f Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, or at deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour, and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 5 January 2004, the date of transition to Adopted IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
ii Leased assets Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Leased assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
iii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment presses, kilns and furnaces 1020 years Other plant and equipment 10 years Fixtures and fittings 10 years Motor vehicles and IT equipment 3 years g Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 5 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 5 January 2004 has not been reconsidered.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment see accounting policy k. ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC 67 1.
Accounting policies continued g Intangible assets continued Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development, use, and sale of products or processes.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite.
Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date.
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 3 years Computer software 36 years Operating intangible assets 820 years h Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their fair value less impairment losses see accounting policy k. i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories see accounting policy i and deferred tax assets see accounting policy r, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated see i below.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been derecognised.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups investments in held-to-maturity securities and receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate i. e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment An impairment loss in respect of a held-to-maturity security or receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
68 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies continued k Impairment continued An impairment loss in respect of an investment in an equity instrument classified as available-for-sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss shall be reversed, with the amount of the reversal recognised in profit or loss.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
l Share capital i Preference share capital Preference share capital is classified as equity if it is non-redeemable and any dividends are discretionary, or is redeemable but only at the Companys option.
Dividends on preference share capital classified as equity are recognised as distributions within equity.
ii Ordinary share capital Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share options are recognised as a deduction from equity.
m Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method, or similar approximation, and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
iv Share-based payment transactions The Group operates various share option programmes that allow Group employees to acquire shares in the Company.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP awards of shares are made to various key executives and under the Directors Share Option Plan 2006 2006 ESOP, the Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 2004 ESOS and the Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 1995 ESOS share options are granted by the Company.
The Company also maintains an all-employee sharesave scheme available to employees in the UK and Germany.
The fair value of awards made and options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options and awards under each scheme have been measured using the following models: Directors Share Option Plan 2006 Monte Carlo model Long-Term Incentive Plan 2004 Monte Carlo model Executive Share Option Scheme 2004 Monte Carlo model Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 Binominal Lattice Option pricing model Employee Sharesave Scheme 1995 Black-Scholes Merton model Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Black-Scholes Merton model Employee Sharesave Scheme 2004 Germany Black-Scholes Merton model The choice of model takes into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made and the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.

Accounting policies continued n Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Onerous contracts A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
o Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at their fair value.
p Revenue i Goods sold Revenue is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
ii Government grants Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance that it will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to it.
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised as revenue in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement as other operating income on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.
q Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement see accounting policy e, expected return on IAS 19 pension assets and interest on IAS 19 obligations.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
r Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
s Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products in a particular line of business business segment or in providing products within a particular economic environment geographic segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
The Groups primary business segments are its divisions.

Accounting policies continued t Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business operations.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Discontinued operations are presented in the income statement including the comparative period as a column analysing the post tax profit or loss of the discontinued operation and the post tax gain or loss recognised on the remeasurement to fair value less costs to sell or on disposal of the assets disposal groups constituting discontinued operations.
u Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity i. e. forming part of shareholders funds only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: i they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group: and ii where the instrument will or may be settled in the Companys own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Companys own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability.
Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Companys own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance expenses.
Finance payments associated with financial instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
v Investments in debt and equity securities Investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity in the fair value reserve, except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses.
When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
w Interest-bearing borrowings Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
x Capitalisation of borrowing costs Borrowing costs are capitalised when they are incurred on raising specific funds to finance a major capital project, which will be a significant productive asset.
y Dividends Dividends payable are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are declared.
z Own shares held by ESOP trust Transactions of the Group-sponsored ESOP trust are included in the Group financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
aa Adopted IFRSs not yet applied The following adopted IFRSs were available for early application but have not been applied by the Group in these financial statements: i IFRS 8, Operating Segments ii IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions The Group does not expect the above amendments to have any significant impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 5 January 2008.

The amount of 88.9 million standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 14 July 1993 was transferred to the Special reserve against which goodwill on consolidation can be written off.
This reserve, together with the amounts standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 12 October 1990 of 71.5 million, on 19 June 1987 of 38.9 million and on 27 July 1989 of 12.3 million which were transferred following previous Orders of the High Court, becomes distributable to the extent of subsequent increases in issued share capital and Share Premium Account.

Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk.
This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board delegates the establishment and implementation of the systems for internal control and risk management to the operating divisions which are responsible for the identification and evaluation of significant risks applicable to their area of business together with the design and operation of suitable internal controls.
The Board delegates the monitoring and review of the internal control and risk mangement systems to the Audit Committee assisted by the Risk Management Committee.
The Risk Managment Committee, which is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, reviews the full range of risks faced by Morgan Crucible as a Group, ensures there are adequate systems in place and evaluates their effectiveness.
Where necessary, the Risk Management Committee will initiate action to improve the systems and ensure compliance.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
The Group has sterling notional cash pooling agreements in place with Barclays and National Westminster banks.
Under the notional cash pooling agreement the Group has the legal right to offset liabilities on undrawn bank accounts against surplus balances.
As at 5 January 2008 the Group had no intention to settle these balances either simultaneously or on a net basis and hence the financial assets and liabilities within the notional cash pool are not presented on a net basis in the financial statements.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
Approximately 3% of the Groups revenue is attributable to sales transactions with a single customer.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
The Group serves thousands of customers.
Many of these have purchased the same product for several years and in some cases decades.
Others have modified and enhanced designs or adopted the same components into new products, extending the lifecycle of the components that the Group supply.
The Groups level of customer retention is very high, particularly with its major accounts and although the top twenty ranking will alter year to year, many of the same names remain consistent over time.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar financial assets.
86 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20.
Financial risk management continued Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a sound credit rating.
Given these high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 m m Available-for-sale financial assets 7.5 7.2 Loan to associate 36.0 Loans and receivables 114.8 114.4 Cash and cash equivalents 108.0 97.4 266.3 219.0 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by division was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 m m Carbon 33.7 30.3 Technical Ceramics 19.3 20.9 Thermal Ceramics 55.7 58.3 Molten Metal Systems 6.1 4.9 114.8 114.4 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 m m Europe 51.8 57.5 Americas 39.0 36.7 Far East and Australasia 22.5 18.6 Middle East and Africa 1.5 1.6 114.8 114.4 Impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2007 2006 m m Not past due 92.5 89.2 Past due 0-30 days 15.3 17.3 Past due 3160 days 3.4 5.0 Past due 6190 days 2.2 2.2 Past due more than 90 days 5.8 5.5 119.2 119.2 Impairment allowance 4.4 4.8 114.8 114.4 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Balance at 5 January 4.8 5.9 Decrease in allowance for impairment 0.4 1.1 Balance at 4 January 4.4 4.8 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC 87 20.
Financial risk management continued Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
A specific impairment allowance may be created in respect of an individual trade receivable for which full recovery is doubtful.
As at 4 January 2008 and 4 January 2007 there were no specific impairment allowances that were significant to the Group.
In addition, local management may create a general impairment allowance to reflect their experience of the historical recoverability of trade receivables past due in the respective markets in which their businesses operate.
The allowances in the accounts in respect of trade receivables are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible: at the point the amount is considered irrecoverable it is written off against the financial asset directly.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost-effective borrowing structure.
The policy is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquidity available to meet all foreseeable needs.

Financial risk management continued Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group buys and sells derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Risk Management Committee.
Generally the Group seeks to apply hedge accounting in order to manage volatility in profit or loss.
Interest rate risk Profile At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Carrying amount 2007 2006 m m Fixed rate instruments Financial assets 108.0 97.4 Financial liabilities 127.0 52.0 19.0 45.4 Variable rate instruments Financial liabilities 100.7 79.5 The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that between 30% and 70% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings is on a fixed rate basis.
Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments A change of 100 basis points in interest rates on the outstanding Bank Syndication debt at the reporting date would have increased decreased profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2006.

Financial risk management continued Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the currency of the reporting unit.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily GBP, USD and Euro.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: 2007 2006 GBP USD Euro GBP USD Euro Functional currency of Group operations m m m m m m Trade receivables 1.1 7.5 7.6 0.6 7.1 8.9 Cash and cash equivalents 0.3 15.5 14.5 0.3 4.4 10.2 Borrowings 74.8 Trade payables 4.5 6.2 3.5 2.6 5.8 6.3 Net balance sheet exposure 3.1 16.8 56.2 1.7 5.7 12.8 The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Year-end rate 2007 2006 2007 2006 USD 2.0003 1.8440 1.9742 1.9447 Euro 1.4615 1.4673 1.3363 1.4857 The Group aims to hedge all material trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
At any point in time the Group also hedges up to 75% of its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecasted sales and purchases over the following 12 months.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
Most of the forward exchange contracts have maturities of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the currency of the reporting unit, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
Forecasted transactions The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of forecasted transactions at 4 January 2008 was 1.2 million 2006: nil, comprising assets of nil 2006: nil and liabilities of 1.2 million 2006: nil that were recognised in fair value derivatives.
Cash flow hedges The contractual cash flows associated with the forward exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are shown in the section on liquidity risk.
The impact on profit or loss is expected to occur at the same time as the associated cash flows.
Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Both the changes in fair value of the forward contracts and the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognised in the income statement.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as economic hedges of monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies at 4 January 2008 was nil 2006: nil.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiary The Group manages the translation exposure of overseas net assets by seeking to match the currency of borrowings with the currency in which the net assets are denominated.
The objectives are to maintain a low cost of borrowing, whilst maintaining a balanced portfolio of net assets by currency.
The Group designates the Euro drawdowns under the US$420 million Bank Syndication as a hedge of the Groups investment in subsidiaries in Europe.
Euro drawdowns during 2007 amounted to 100 million.
There were no Euro drawdowns in 2006.
Sensitivity analysis A 10% strengthening of sterling against the following currency net assets at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
Equity 2007 2006 m m USD 0.5 6.2 Euro 1.4 3.8 The impact of a one cent movement in the USD exchange rate on results that are reported in USD including those currencies that track the USD would be c. 1.4 million of revenue and 0.3 million of underlying operating profit.
90 THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20.
Financial risk management continued Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held for meeting partially the unfunded portion of the Groups defined benefit pension obligations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy is to maximise returns in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded defined benefit obligations.
Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base total equity so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board uses a number of measures, identified as key performance indicators KPI, to ensure the continued success of the Group.
The main KPI for the Group is the underlying profit margin.
The aim is to achieve mid-teen margins in good times and double digit margins when the environment is more challenging.
Another KPI, the economic value added ratio EVA, compares the returns made by our divisions with the notional cost of investing in them.
The Group uses this ratio to ascertain where to make capital investments within the Group.
The basic calculation deducts the cost of capital from the net operating profit after allowing for a notional medium-term tax charge.
The Board encourages employees of the Group to hold the Companys ordinary shares.
The Group operates a number of employee share and share option schemes.
From time to time the Company purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices.
Primarily the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under the Groups various share option incentive schemes.
The Company has also acquired its own shares under a share buy-back programme.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Fair values The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value Carrying amount Fair value 2007 2007 2006 2006 m m m m 6.84% US Dollar Senior Notes 2013 27.8 29.7 32.9 34.5 6.23% US Dollar Senior Notes 2010 12.5 12.9 16.8 17.2 5.70% US Dollar Senior Notes 2014 38.0 38.0 6.12% US Dollar Senior Notes 2017 46.6 46.6 Bank Syndication 74.8 74.8 50.0 50.0 Bank and other loans 5.1 5.1 5.0 5.0 Bank overdrafts 20.8 20.8 24.5 24.5 Obligations under finance leases 2.1 2.1 2.3 2.3 Trade and other payables 71.2 71.2 72.1 72.1 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: liabilities 1.2 1.2 Available-for-sale financial assets 7.5 7.5 7.2 7.2 Loan to associate 36.0 36.0 Loans and receivables 114.8 114.8 114.4 114.4 Cash and cash equivalents 108.0 108.0 97.4 97.4 33.8 36.1 15.4 13.4 Unrecognised loss 2.3 2.0 Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table.
Equity securities Fair value is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE MORGAN CRUCIBLE COMPANY PLC 91 20.
Financial risk management continued Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to determine the fair value of loans and borrowings and finance leases are as follows: 2007 2006 Loans and borrowings 3.05.0% 5.06.0% Finance leases 6.0% 6.0% 21.
Employee benefits Morgan Crucible operates a number of defined benefit arrangements as well as defined contribution plans.
The defined benefit plans are primarily in the UK, US and Europe and predominately provide pensions based on service and career average pay.
In addition post-retirement medical plans are operated in the US.

The curtailment gain in Italy of 0.7 million has occurred due to a change in legislation covering Italian pension plans.
The curtailment gain in 2006 arose from changes made to the UK pension schemes from 6 April 2006.
These included the conversion of both UK Schemes from final salary to career average schemes, future increases for pensions from past service being linked to general inflation rather than salary inflation and, in addition, normal retirement being increased from 60 62 to 65 in the senior scheme.
This curtailment gain is disclosed as a one-off item on the face of the income statement.
The Group has adopted the policy of recognising actuarial gains and losses immediately in the balance sheet through the statement of recognised income and expense.

In placing a current estimate on the Companys past service benefit obligations, a number of assumptions about the future are required.
For defined benefit schemes, the Directors make annual estimates and assumptions in respect of discount rates, future changes in salaries, employee turnover, inflation rates and life expectancy.
In making these estimates and assumptions, the Directors consider advice provided by external advisers, such as actuaries.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
The total expense relating to these plans in the current year was 2.1 million 2006: 2.2 million.
Share-based payments During 2004, the Group established a new Long Term Incentive Plan and a new Executive Share Option Scheme.
Grants were also made out of the existing Morgan Executive Share Option Scheme 1995.
During 2004, the Company also renewed its all-Employee Sharesave Scheme and took the opportunity to extend a similar scheme to employees in Germany.
In 2006, the Group established a new Directors Share Option Plan.
During 2005,2006 and 2007 the Group made additional awards out of the 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan.
During 2005 and 2006 the Group made additional awards out of the 2004 Executive Share Option Scheme and during 2006 an award was made out of the Directors Share Option Plan 2006.

If the Companys TSR places it at the median, then 30% of the awards will vest on the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
If the Companys TSR places it at the upper quartile, then 100% of the option will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
Between the median and upper quartile, the option will vest on a straight-line basis.
Below the median, none of the shares will vest.
From 2007 onwards, additional performance criteria have been attached to the Long Term Incentive Plan 2004 for all awards made from 2007 onwards.
The TSR performance criteria referred to above now only relate to 50% of awards made.
The extent to which the other 50% of these awards vest will depend on the Companys Earnings per share EPS compared with the Retail Price Index RPI.
The full 50% will vest if over the three year performance period, the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 10% per annum.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and between 4% and 10% per annum then the proportion of awards vesting will be interpolated between 15% and 50%.
If the Companys EPS increases by more than the sum of the annual RPI increase and 4% per annum then 15% of the awards will vest.
If the Companys EPS increases by less than the sum of the RPI increase and 4% per annum then 0% of the awards will vest.
In addition, an improvement must be shown in the Companys underlying financial performance.
Performance criteria for Executive Share Option Scheme 1995 The diluted earnings per share for the Company must grow by at least 2% per annum in excess of retail price inflation over the period of date of grant to date of vesting.
The fair values of services received are in return for awards made and share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on an appropriate model as shown in the accounting policy note m. In the case of the Binomial Lattice model and Monte Carlo model the contractual life of the options and awards are used as an input.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into both of these models.
