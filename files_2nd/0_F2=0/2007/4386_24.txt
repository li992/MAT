Tax charges are calculated by applying the statutory tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to the accounting profit before tax for each entity.
The sum of the tax charges for each entity is then divided by the Group accounting profit before tax to derive the weighted average rate of corporation tax for the year.
The weighted average rate of corporation tax has changed from the previous accounting period due to differences in the weighted average mix of profits in each tax jurisdiction and also due to the inclusion of Norwegian and Egyptian taxable profits and the applicable tax rates.
