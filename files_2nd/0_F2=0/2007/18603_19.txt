Unless previously redeemed, converted, purchased or cancelled the bond is convertible at any time up to 12 May 2014 into fully paid up ordinary shares at a conversion price of 8.64.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument and the carrying amount has been allocated to its equity and liability components in the balance sheet.
The liability component has been determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component.
The discount rate used for this was a rate of 7.5% compounded semi-annually.
The liability component has been deducted from the fair value of the compound financial instrument as a whole and the residual element has been assigned to the equity component.
The liability element is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

This has resulted in a deferred tax credit of 0.1m in the year which has been taken through the income statement.
