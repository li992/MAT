6891 Report 2006-07 1 6 07 17:37 Page 34 PURSUE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE Burberrys goal is to be recognised as much for its operational expertise as for its product and marketing excellence.
Project Atlas a five year, 50m programme to redesign Burberrys business processes and systems is the key enabler as the Group seeks to operate more efficiently and effectively.
Having successfully completed its second preparatory year, the project moves to full scale deployment in 2007 08.
This investment will benefit every aspect of our business from product development, to supply chain, to wholesale customers, to stores, to financial reporting.
While Atlas operates on a Group-wide level, Burberry continues to enhance excellence within individual functions: In design, style reduction to improve retail presentation, order fulfilment and sourcing economics In supply chain, ongoing effort to improve the basic replenishment programme introduced in Autumn 2006 In sourcing, reducing internal complexity through more sophisticated relationships with suppliers and a more streamlined structure 34 PURSUE OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
