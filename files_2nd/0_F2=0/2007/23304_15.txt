"ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ""UK GAAP"" and the AIC Statement of Recommended Practice ""SORP"" for Investment Trusts dated January 2003 and revised in December 2005. a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted."
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the income statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate on the security.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short-term loans and deposits are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Long-term borrowings Long-term borrowings are carried in the Balance Sheet at the cumulative amount of net proceeds on issue plus accrued finance costs.
Finance costs include the difference between the repayable value on maturity and the proceeds received on issue which are written off on an effective interest rate basis over the life of the borrowings.
Gains and losses on the repurchase or early settlement of debt is wholly charged to capital.
e Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of the investment management fee and debenture interest.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Boards expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
Since April 2000, the Company has allocated 70% of management fee and debenture interest to capital and 30% to revenue costs.
In accordance with the SORP the Board has reviewed this policy and, having examined consensus forecasts of capital return and dividend payments, sees no need to change the existing policy at this time.
f Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
g Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
h Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
"Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as ""at fair value through profit or loss""."
"They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost and subsequently, the investments are valued at ""fair value"", which is measured as follows: Listed investments are valued at bid prices, where the bid price is available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date."
Page 32 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements Transaction costs Financial Reporting Standard FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement requires that the cost of purchasing investments be recognised and accounted for as a separate item from investment gains.
The Company includes these costs in the cost of investments purchased and has disclosed them in note 9. i Capital reserve realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - realised.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
Capital reserve unrealised Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve - unrealised.
"j Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: ""Events after the Balance Sheet Date"" dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date."

TAXATION ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES a Analysis of charge in year Overseas taxation 14 30 Total current tax for year see note 6b 14 30 Page 34 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The taxation assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK for an investment trust company of 30% 2006: 30%.
The differences are explained below.
2007 2006 000 000 Revenue return on ordinary activities before taxation 40,728 36,348 Return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 30% 2006: 30% 12,218 10,904 Effects of: Income not subject to corporation tax 13,571 11,643 Increase decrease in excess management expenses excess loan relationship debits in the revenue account 1,353 739 Overseas taxation 14 30 Current corporation tax charge note 6a 14 30 Investment trust companies are exempt from tax on capital gains if they meet the HM Revenue and Customs criteria set out in Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 for a given period.
Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c Deferred taxation At 31 March 2007, the Company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 209,854,510 2006: 188,813,724 and eligible unrelieved foreign taxation totalling 86,464 2006: 73,550.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.

NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 26.
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the Articles of Association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures follows:- 2007 2006 Total shareholders funds 1,205,227,000 1,214,604,000 Less: Debenture stock discount 57,000 61,000 Debenture stock issue expense 3,838,000 4,085,000 Net assets debt at par 1,201,332,000 1,210,458,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 215,496,748 233,946,714 Total shareholders funds per share pence 559.28 519.18 Less: Unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses pence 1.81 1.77 Net asset value per share debt at par pence 557.47 517.41 2007 2006 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows:- Net assets debt at par at 31 March 2006 1,210,458 997,331 Total recognised capital gain for the year 75,076 230,105 Revenue return for the year 40,714 36,318 Dividend appropriated in the year 44,596 31,789 Movement in unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 251 251 Repurchase of ordinary shares 80,571 21,758 Net assets debt at par at 31 March 2007 1,201,332 1,210,458 The net asset value per share adjusted to include the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is 530.90p 2006: 486.20p.
In accordance with FRS 21: Events after Balance Sheet Date dividends in respect of the year but paid after the balance sheet date have not been deducted from the respective year end net asset values NAVs.
However, the Directors believe that an adjusted capital NAV, recognising the deduction of such dividends, better reflects the underlying capital performance, particularly given the change to distributing dividends more evenly throughout the year.
The reconciliation between NAV per the accounts and the adjusted capital NAV is set out below: Reconciliation of NAV to adjusted capital NAV 2007 2006 000 000 Net assets debt at par as above 1,201,332 1,210,458 Less: Third interim dividend paid after the year end 9,407 Proposed final dividend payable after the year end 12,058 25,383 Adjusted capital net assets debt at par 1,179,867 1,185,075 Less: Debenture stocks par to market value adjustment 57,248 73,010 Adjusted capital net assets debt at market value 1,122,619 1,112,065 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 215,496,748 233,946,714 Adjusted capital net asset value per share debt at par pence 547.51 506.56 Adjusted capital net asset value per share debt at market value pence 520.94 475.35 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report 2007 Page 39 Notes to the Financial Statements 2007 2006 000 000 16.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Management of risk The investment objectives of the Company are detailed in Objectives and Highlights on page 2.
In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policies Futures and covered call options held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk, which comprises equity price risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency exposure and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Counterparty credit risk is not judged to be significant as transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, all transactions are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets monthly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200 million of the debenture stocks in the equity market.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact could be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Investment Manager invests part of the assets available in short-term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
Long futures positions have been used during the year as a quick and effective means to increase the Companys exposure to the equity market.
Due to the movement of markets in the year transactions in futures have resulted in realised capital losses of 179,000 2006: gains 455,000.
