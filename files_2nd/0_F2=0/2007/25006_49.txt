Financial statements ICAP plc 109 Annual Report 2007 29 Contingent liabilities continued On 27 January 2004 NAB announced that it incurred FX option trading losses of A$360m 158m.
Detailed reports following full investigations into these losses were published by  PwC and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority in March 2004 and indicated that NAB incurred these FX trading losses between April 2003 and January 2004.
The PwC report includes descriptions of how certain NAB dealers concealed losses by processing false spot FX and false FX option transactions, booking one-sided internal FX option transactions and using incorrect dealing rates for genuine transactions.
The reports analyse the cause of these trading losses, including the methods of concealment allegedly employed by the NAB dealers, repeated failures of NAB risk management, absence of NAB financial controls, gaps in NAB back office procedures, inadequate NAB corporate governance and NAB corporate cultural weaknesses.
NAB accepted the findings of the PwC report on 28 April 2004.
Neither ICAP Currency Options Pte Limited nor any other member of the ICAP Group or TFS-ICAP accept any responsibility for these NAB FX trading losses and intend to vigorously contest any claim which may be made against them in this matter.
ICAP Currency Options Pte Limited has been informed that a similar allegation has been asserted by NAB against another interdealer broker, which is not a party to the TFS-ICAP joint venture, in respect of these FX options trading losses.
It is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome with certainty nor to determine the extent of liability, if any, of ICAP plc or ICAP Currency Options Pte Limited.
