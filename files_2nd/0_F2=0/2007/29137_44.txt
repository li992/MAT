The fair value is shown under the heading Financial Liabilities below.
Financial Assets Fixed asset investments are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair value.
A full list of the Companys investments is given on pages 14 to 16.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the investment portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments by their aggregate market value are contained in the Managers Review Section.
Financial Liabilities Long term borrowings are included in the accounts in accordance with FRS26.
Deducting long term borrowings at fair value would have the effect of reducing the net asset value per share from 631.0p to 607.1p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2007 of 542.0p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 10.7% as against 14.1% on a traditional basis.
At 31 March 2006 the effect would have been to reduce the net asset value from 610.9p to 584.1p.
Taking the market price of the ordinary shares at 31 March 2006 of 521.5p, this would have given a discount to net asset value of 10.7% as against 14.6% on a traditional basis.
