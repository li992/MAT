DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Currency derivatives The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange contracts and average rate options to hedge its exposure to exchange rate movements.
Although these contracts act as an economic hedge they are not designated in a hedge relationship for hedge accounting purposes.
Gains or losses are consequently taken directly to the income statement.
At 31 December 2007, the total notional amount of the Groups outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is 61.0m 2006 69.4m.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives amounting to a 2.2m profit 2006 1.7m have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Interest rate swaps and caps The Group uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its principal bank and other borrowings.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2007 was 95.9m 2006 79.5m.
Swap contracts with notional values of 35.2m 2006 35.7m have fixed interest receipts at an average rate of 7.047% 2006 7.047% and floating interest payments at an average rate of 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% 2006 6 month LIBOR plus 2.857% up to 2012.
At 31 December 2007 the fixed interest receivable rates vary from 6.61% to 7.375% 2006 6.61% to 7.375% and floating interest payable rates vary from 7.968% to 8.458% 2006 8.2% to 8.7%.
Further swap contracts, with notional values at 31 December 2007 of 25.1m 2006 5.1m have fixed interest payments of 4.914% 2006 4.2% and floating interest receipts of 5.391% 2006 5.63% until 2009.
On maturity of two of the swap contracts in 2009, the counterparties have the option to extend the swaps for a further three-and-a-half years for a notional US$40m, of which US$20m is at 5.085% and US$20m is at 5.1%.
Cap contracts with notional values of 35.6m 2006 38.7m have interest rates capped at the average rate of 4.457% 2006 3.94%.
On maturity of one of the cap contracts the counterparty has the option to enter into an interest rate swap for four years for a notional US$30m at 4.2% 2006 US$30m at 4.2% if the four year interest rate swap rate is below 4.2% 2006 4.2%.
Fixed to floating interest rate swaps are designated and accounted for as fair value hedges.
The movement in the fair value of these contracts is dealt with in the income statement.
The borrowings that are hedged by these swaps are measured at amortised cost and adjusted for the fair value of the hedged risk, with the movement in fair value dealt with in the income statement and set-off against the movement in the fair value of these swaps.
The ineffective portion recognised in the income statement that arises from fair value hedges amounts to a gain of 0.1m 2006 nil as shown in note 7.
Interest of 0.5m 2006 0.4m was paid on the interest rate swaps designated in a fair value hedge relationship.

DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Floating to fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate caps are not designated in a hedge relationship.
These instruments are measured at fair value and the movement is correspondingly dealt with in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps not designated in a hedge relationship amounting to a 1.0m loss 2006 0.3m gain have been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Commodity Derivatives The change in the fair value of oil and gas price derivatives of 7.6m loss 2006 1.6m gain has been recognised in the income statement during the year.
Electricity price swaps were entered to hedge the risk arising from movements in electricity prices and these have been designated in a cash flow hedge.
Payments for electricity will be made monthly during the next twelve months.
There were no gains or losses recognised in the hedging reserve note 31 during the year 2006 0.6m gain.
These gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods when payments for electricity are made.
Gains of 0.3m 2006 nil were removed from equity during the year and were included in cost of sales in the income statement.
No 2006 nil ineffectiveness arose on the cash flow hedges during the year.

The fair value of other financial instruments, that are not traded in an active market, is determined by using standard valuation techniques, predominantly based on discounted cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by the deviation in future expected cash flows calculated by reference to the movement in market quoted exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is based on their future cash flows, projected using the yield curve at the balance sheet date and discounted using rates determined from the relevant curve.
The fair values of interest rate caps, foreign exchange options and interest rate swap options are based on the Blacks financial model.
The carrying values of available for sale unlisted investments are based on the Directors best estimate of fair value.
The fair values of non-sterling denominated financial instruments are translated into sterling using the year end exchange rate.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS Hunting PLCs activities expose it to certain financial risks, namely market risk including currency risk, fair value interest risk, cash flow interest risk and commodity price risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups risk management strategy seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance.
As part of its strategy, both primary and derivative financial instruments are used to hedge its risk exposures.
There are clearly defined objectives and principles for managing financial risk established by the Board of Directors, with policies, parameters and procedures covering the specific areas of funding, banking relationships, foreign currency and interest rate exposures and cash management.
annual report & accounts two thousand & seven 77 Notes to the Financial Statements continued The Groups treasury function is responsible for implementing the policies and providing a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management.
It is also responsible for identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating companies.
a Foreign exchange risk Hunting PLCs international base is exposed to foreign exchange risk from its investing, financing and operating activities, particularly with the US and Canadian dollars.
Foreign exchange risks arise from future transactions and cash flows and from recognised monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the Groups local operations.
i Transactional risk The exposure to exchange rate movements in significant future transactions and cash flows is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options and currency swaps.
These derivatives have not been designated in a hedge relationship.
Operating companies prepare quarterly rolling twelve month cash flow forecasts to enable working capital currency exposures to be identified.
Exposures arising from committed long-term projects beyond a twelve month period are also identified.
The currency flows to be hedged are currently set at 250,000 equivalent for monthly transactions and 500,000 equivalent for annual transactions.
No speculative positions are entered into by the Group.
The table below shows the carrying values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December, including derivative financial instruments, on which exchange differences would potentially be recognised in the income statement in the following year.
The table excludes net borrowings that have been designated in a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, as exchange differences arising on these net borrowings are recognised directly in equity.
