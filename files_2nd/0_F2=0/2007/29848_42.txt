A summary of the split is shown below.
Group Company 000 000 Capital reserve realised 411,033 411,033 Capital reserve unrealised 35,708 35,708 446,741 446,741 19 CONTINGENT ASSETS LIABILITIES AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS In 2004, the AIC lodged an appeal for the payment of investment trust management fees to be exempt from VAT.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice found in favour of the appellants and in November 2007 HM Revenue and Customs HMRC announced their withdrawal from the case.
This means VAT will no longer be charged on investment management fees and for some investment trusts it may be possible to recover some of the VAT paid in the past.
Nevertheless, a number of legal and procedural matters remain to be resolved before certainty is reached in respect of entitlement to repayment of VAT paid in the past.
In the absence of a definitive agreement with the Manager or guidance from HMRC as to how the reclaims will be effected, it is not practicable to quantify the amount of any recovery.
Consequently, no amounts have been recognised as an asset within these accounts.
As at 31 December 2007 there were no other contingent assets liabilities or capital commitments for the Company and the Group 2006: nil.
