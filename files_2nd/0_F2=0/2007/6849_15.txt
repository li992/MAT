55 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007 33.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting and presentation The accounts are prepared on a going-concern basis, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting and financial reporting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention with the exception of derivatives, where the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Revaluation of properties Fixed asset licensed properties are revalued at least every five years on an existing use basis and the surplus or deficit reflected in the balance sheet.
Interim valuations are performed in the third year, or sooner if there is evidence of a material change in value.
Valuations of other fixed asset properties were undertaken in 1999 and earlier years and in accordance with FRS 15 are retained but not updated.
Surpluses and deficits are taken directly to the revaluation reserve, except to the extent that the valuation falls below both historic cost and supportable value-in-use, when they are taken to the profit and loss account, and on realisation are transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost and held as fixed assets on the balance sheet.
Income is recognised from these investments only in relation to distributions received from post-acquisition profits.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on timing differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all timing differences except where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and in respect of taxable timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the timing differences can be controlled and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible timing differences and carry forward of unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available, against which the deductible timing differences and the carry forward of unused tax losses can be utilised, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit or taxable profit or loss and, in respect of deductible timing differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the timing differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available, against which timing differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is not longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument and are fide-recognised when the company no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial instrument, normally through sale or when all cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed to an independent third party.
The exemption has been taken per FRS 25.3C, whereby the company is exempt from producing disclosure required by the standard as the group accounts contain disclosure that complies with FRS 25.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2006 07 56 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 29 APRIL 2007 Finance costs and income Finance costs are expensed to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method and are not capitalised.
Finance income is recognised in the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its variable rate loans, notes and bonds.
Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value, if any, and carried on the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Subsequent measurement is at fair value determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
If a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting the gain or loss arising on the movement in fair value is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting To qualify for hedge accounting the hedge relationship must be designated and documented at inception.
Documentation must include the company's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge and formal allocation to the item or transaction being hedged.
The company also documents how it will assess the effectiveness of the hedge and carries out assessments on a regular basis to determine whether it has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly effective.
Hedges can be classified as either fair value hedging exposure to changes in fair value of an asset or liability, or cash flow hedging the variability in cash flows attributable to an asset, liability, or forecast transaction.
The company uses its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
Own shares Own shares consist of treasury shares and shares held within an employee benefit trust.
The company has an employee benefit trust for the granting of shares to applicable employees.
Own shares are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders' equity.
Subsequent consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on transactions in treasury shares.
