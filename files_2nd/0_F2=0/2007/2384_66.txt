48 Suspended exploration well costs Included within the total exploration expenditure of $5,252 million 2006 $4,110 million and 2005 $4,008 million shown as part of intangible assets see Note 25 is an amount of $2,342 million 2006 $1,863 million and 2005 $1,931 million representing costs directly associated with exploration wells.
The carried costs of exploration wells are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once per year to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from the discovery.
In evaluating whether costs incurred meet the criteria for initial and continued capitalization, management uses two main criteria: i that exploration drilling is still under way or rmly planned, or ii that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing.
The following table provides the year-end balances and movements for suspended exploration well costs.
The table above shows a total of 51 projects that have exploration well costs that have been capitalized for more than twelve months as at 31 December 2007.
Of these, there are 24 projects where exploratory wells have been drilled in the preceding 12 months or further exploratory drilling is planned in the next year.
Projects with completed exploration activity comprise a total of 27 projects, whose costs totalled $672 million at 31 December 2007.
Details of the activities being undertaken to progress these projects towards development are shown below.
