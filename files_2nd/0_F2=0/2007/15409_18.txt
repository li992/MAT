Following the sale of Redpath and the surrender of quota and termination of operations at Eastern Sugar, these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations.
Accounting policies The Group has adopted IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease in the current financial year.
Comparative information has been restated.
The adoption of this interpretation increased net debt and property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2006 by 8 million and did not materially impact the income statement.
Impact of changes in exchange rates The Groups results have been negatively impacted this year by exchange rate translation, in particular due to the weakening of the US dollar against sterling.
Exchange rates used to translate reported results were as follows: Average rates Closing rates 2007 2006 Impact 2007 2006 Impact US dollar : sterling 1.89 1.79 -5.6% 1.97 1.74 -13.2% Euro : sterling 1.48 1.47 -0.7% 1.47 1.43 -2.8% Unless otherwise stated, the financial information presented in this review is stated at the relevant prevailing exchange rate for the year described.
Summary of Group performance Sales from continuing operations of 3,814 million were 349 million or 10% above last year.
Adjusting for the adverse impact of exchange rate translation, which reduced sales by 152 million, underlying sales increased by 15%.
In the two Food & Industrial Ingredients divisions higher raw material and energy costs were recovered in the pricing rounds.
Sales were also well ahead in the sugar trading business due mainly to increased volumes.
Operating profit from continuing operations increased by 18% from 300 million to 355 million due to strongly improved sales and margins in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas and the benefit of lower depreciation in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe following the asset impairment in the previous financial year.
Profits from the SPLENDA Sucralose business were modestly ahead of the prior year.
These improvements were partially offset by the adverse impact of exchange rate translation, which reduced Group operating profit by 16 million, and lower profits in Sugars, Europe due mainly to the oversupply of sugar in the EU.
The margin of operating profit as a percentage of sales increased from 8.7% to 9.3%.
Exceptional items from continuing operations amounted to a net loss before tax of 13 million 2006 loss of 248 million.
A charge of 33 million was recognised in Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas following the decision to close the citric acid facilities at Selby, UK, and a fundamental review of the astaxanthin business.
This was partially offset by a gain in Sucralose of 20 million due to releasing part of a provision for deferred consideration set up at the time of the April 2004 realignment.
An exceptional gain of 23 million was recognised in respect of the discontinued Eastern Sugar joint venture following the decision to surrender quota to the EU Restructuring Fund and a successful litigation claim.
