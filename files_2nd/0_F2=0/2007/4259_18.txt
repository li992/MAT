NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 1 General information CSR plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on page 97.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards In the current period, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures with effect from 30 December 2006.
It has also adopted the related amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital see note 32.
The Group has adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in advance of its effective date, with effect from 30 December 2006.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical using a risks and rewards approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
In 2006 under IAS 14, the Group had one class of business, being the design and marketing of single chip radio devices.
Following the adoption of IFRS 8, the Groups reportable segments are as follows: Cellular Mobile phones, headsets and audio-related Non Cellular Beyond the mobile phone including PC, Automotive and Consumer applications The Group has identified business segments based on the internal reporting within the Group and has chosen to aggregate those business segments which meet the aggregation criteria specified in IFRS 8 for disclosure as reportable segments.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised IAS 23 Borrowing Costs revised IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods, with the exception of the amendments to IFRS 3, will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS 3 revised may have a significant impact on the profit before tax and effective tax rate in future years.
The adoption of the standard removes the requirement to adjust goodwill after the normal 12 month period following the business combination, when recognising a deferred tax asset for pre-acquisition losses of an acquired subsidiary.
As disclosed in note 20, the Group has significant unrecognised tax losses which may become recognisable in future periods after the adoption of this standard.
The Group is reviewing when it will adopt this standard, but notes that at the current time it has yet to be adopted by the European Union, and the earliest date of application is for periods commencing on or after 1 July 2007.
3 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The financial statements cover the 52 week period from 30 December 2006 to 28 December 2007: the comparatives are presented for the 52 week period from 31 December 2005 to 29 December 2006.
The financial statements are reported on a 52 week basis to be consistent with the Groups internal reporting.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of CSR plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 63 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation continued The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of the acquisition below the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially measured as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested annually or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Royalty income is recognised upon shipment of the royalty earning product by the licencee.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered on a percentage of completion basis.
Revenue from post contract support is recognised over the period of performance.
The excess of service fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Revenue is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of CSR plc and its subsidiaries is the US dollar and this is also the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
64 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 3 Accounting policies continued Foreign currencies continued At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation The tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences, unused carried forward tax losses and unused carried forward tax credits can be utilised.
However, such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit: investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Computer equipment 2 to 3 years Test equipment 2 to 5 years Office equipment 3 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Leasehold improvements minimum lease period CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 65 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment continued Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Other intangible assets Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost or fair value for items acquired in business combinations, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
On other intangible fixed assets, amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or fair value, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Software licences licence term Customer contracts and relationships 3 years Purchased R&D 4 to 10 years Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost net of any provision for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as a new device or software : the project from which the asset arises meets the Groups criteria for assessing technical feasibility: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
66 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 3 Accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill continued Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the reversal is limited so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the first-in-first-out FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments consist of money market deposits in USD, GBP and Euros.
Interest income is recorded as it accrues over the period of the investment at rates fixed at the time of inception.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impaired.
Objective evidence of impairment could include significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 67 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 3 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in note 32 to the financial statements.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The Groups policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of forecast GBP expenditure for the following 11 to 15 months.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Hedge accounting Hedges of foreign exchange risk on firm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Note 19 sets out details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.
Movements in the hedging reserve in equity are also detailed in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled into profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.
When the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Provisions Provisions for warranty and returns costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provision is made for onerous contracts at the fair value of the minimum unavoidable lease payments, net of any amounts recoverable from sub-leases.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, including share options with non-market based vesting conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the majority of share options in issue.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For certain share options which include TSR related condition the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
Employee benefit trust The Group has established an employee benefit trust which is a separately administered trust and is funded by loans from Group companies.
The assets of the trust comprise shares in CSR plc and cash balances.
The Group recognises assets and liabilities of the trust in the consolidated accounts and shares held by the trust are recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
68 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 4 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected by management, additional inventory provisions may be required.
The carrying amount of inventory at 28 December 2007 was $77.3 million 2006: $106.5 million.
Impairment of goodwill The Group reviews goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of expected future cash flows from each cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of the goodwill at 28 December 2007 was $144.2 million 2006: $52.0 million.
Provisions Determining the level of provision required for returns and warranty claims requires management to review the historic levels of usage whilst considering the growth in the business and other changes which have occurred in the manufacturing cycle.
The carrying amount of the provision at 28 December 2007 was $2.4 million 2006: $4.1 million.
6 Segmental reporting Business segments In 2006 under IAS 14 Segment Reporting, CSR had one class of business, being the design and marketing of single chip radio devices.
From 30 December 2006, as a result of an internal reorganisation and based on information reported to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance, the Groups reportable segments are more specifically focussed on the markets which they serve.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments are therefore as follows: Cellular Mobile phones, headsets and audio-related Non Cellular Beyond the mobile phone including PC, Automotive and Consumer applications The Group has identified business segments based on the internal reporting within the Group and have chosen to aggregate those business segments which meet the aggregation criteria specified in IFRS 8 for disclosure as reportable segments.
Comparative information is only provided for the analysis of revenue by the identified reportable segments.
In 2006, the Group was organised as a single reportable segment and the internal reporting systems and structures were only in place from 30 December 2006, therefore the information required to allocate costs and assets to the identified segments in a reasonable way is not available and the cost to produce this information would be excessive.

The accounting policies for the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies as described in note 3.
The segment result represents operating profit earned by each segment without allocation of the $15.0 million patent dispute settlement.
Costs are allocated to segments based on levels of R&D and marketing activity in the period.
This is the measure reported to the Groups Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.

This legislation has been fully enacted.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities, previously stated at 30% of the temporary differences, were remeasured to 28% of those amounts.
In addition, the effective tax rate for the period from 1 April 2008 is expected to reduce accordingly.

These were not recognised at the time of the acquisition as it was not considered probable that taxable profit would be available against which these losses could be utilised.
During 2007 and 2006, a deferred tax asset was recognised for some of these losses and, in accordance with IFRS 3, an equivalent adjustment was made to goodwill.
This resulted in a charge of $279,000 2006: $745,000 which was included within administrative expenses.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: $000 Reportable segment Cash Generating Unit 2007 Cellular Mobile Handsets 129,441 Mobile Headsets 5,906 Non Cellular Automotive 8,860 144,207 In 2006, goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated to the single cash-generating unit.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to CSR.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
For all cash generating units the Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budget approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flow forecasts for the following four years, assuming, for this purpose, no growth.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.3%.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts within trade receivables of $3,000 2006: $92,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
An allowance for credit notes and price adjustments has also been made within trade receivables of $150,000 2006: $150,000.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group uses a credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and define credit limits by customer.
Credit limits and credit quality are regularly reviewed.
It is the policy of the Group to only transact with creditworthy entities to mitigate the risk of default associated with trade receivables.
The Group provides for trade receivables based on amounts estimated as irrecoverable determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
Treasury deposits Treasury deposits represent bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, treasury deposits and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Total trade receivables 81,640 87,246 Cash and cash equivalents 193,311 117,494 Treasury deposits 52,065 30,000 Cash flow hedges 696 4,522 327,712 239,262 The maximum exposure to credit risk for total trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Europe 13,906 9,810 USA 6,540 7,424 Asia 60,438 69,753 Other 756 259 81,640 87,246 76 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 18 Other financial assets continued Exposure to credit risk continued The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk by type of customer, with exposures spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The Groups most significant customer accounts for $18.4 million of trade receivables at 28 December 2007 2006: $12.6 million.
Impairment losses The aging of total trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2007 2007 2006 2006 $000 $000 $000 $000 Not past due 79,071 150 80,578 150 Past due 0-30 days 2,654 4,897 Past due 31-60 days 5 1,142 Past due 61-90 days 337 Past due 91-120 days 119 More than 121 days past due 63 3 415 92 81,793 153 87,488 242 The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the period was as follows: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Balance at the beginning of the period 242 662 Utilised in the period 3,211 797 Additional provisions in the period 3,122 377 Balance at the end of the period 153 242 Included in the Groups trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of $2,719,000 2006: $6,818, 000 which are past due but for which the Group has not provided, as there has been no significant change in the credit quality of the receivables and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold collateral over these balances.
Based on past experience, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due, other than for credit notes and price adjustments.
19 Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The instruments purchased are denominated in GBP.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed is as below: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Forward foreign exchange contracts 178,628 89,441 These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 15 months 2006: 12 months and are renewed on a rolling basis to cover between 11 and 15 months forward.
At the balance sheet date, the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives is shown below: Derivatives that are designated and effective as hedging instruments carried at fair value 2007 2006 $000 $000 Forward foreign exchange contracts assets 696 4,522 liabilities 1,080 384 4,522 The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to a liability of $384,000 2006: asset $4,522,000 has been deferred in equity.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Deferred tax liabilities 8,208 Deferred tax assets 7,021 11,350 1,187 11,350 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of $175,564,000 2006: $86,100,000 available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of $7,793,000 2006: $9,600,000 of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining $167,771,000 2006: $76,500,000 due to the unpredictability of future profit streams within certain subsidiary entities.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of $47,819,000 2006: $36,400,000 that will expire in 17-19 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary timing differences related to undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries was $14,754,000 2006: $7,201,000.
No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

30 Share-based payments CSR plc has grants and awards in the following Share Schemes which result in charges to the Income Statement: Global share option scheme The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group, under which share options were issued prior to flotation, at a price based on the most recent private funding round.
All employees were granted options on joining CSR.
These options have a vesting period of five years, with 20% of options vesting one year after grant, then the remainder vesting in equal quarterly instalments over the remaining four years.
Other options in addition to those related to employees joining were also granted under this scheme.
In all cases if the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
No grants have been made under this scheme since flotation.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 83 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 30 Share-based payments continued Company Share Option Plan CSOP The Company introduced a new scheme at flotation called the CSR plc Share Option Plan.
The following grants have been made under the scheme: Flotation grant On the Companys flotation in February 2004, the Company issued share options to all employees, at a price based on the share price on the day of flotation.
The vesting period is three years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the options lapse.
Performance grants On the Companys flotation in February 2004, and in May 2005, May 2006, May 2007 and certain other dates relating to employees joining the Company issued share options at a price based on the average share price over the preceding three days.
The vesting period of these grants is three years and vesting is dependent upon meeting certain EPS based performance conditions.
Starter Grants The Company grants options to new starters to assist in recruitment.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average share price on the three days preceding the grant date.
The vesting period of the options is over a period of five years with 40% vesting after two years and 5% vesting each quarter thereafter.
Grants are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Company has also issued to starter grants to senior employees that vest after three years.
CSR Share Award Plan In May 2005, following approval of shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company introduced the CSR plc Share Award Plan, which allows for options to be granted for exercise at a future date at a price equivalent to the nominal value of the Companys shares of 0.001.
The following awards have been made: Retention Awards The Company issues employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff retention.
The vesting period of these share awards is three years.
If the share awards remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the awards lapse.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance Awards The Company issues senior employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff incentivisation.
The vesting of the awards is also subject to the Group satisfying two performance conditions.
The first is the Total Shareholder Return of the Companys shares when compared to a group of companies selected at the time an award is first granted.
The second is improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
In order for the shares to vest, the Group must have met or exceeded certain TSR thresholds when compared with the TSR performance of the group of other companies.
In the event the Group satisfies any one of the TSR thresholds, the Remuneration Committee then considers the extent of any improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Group.
SAYE Schemes The Company operates a SAYE scheme, whereby employees are allowed to subscribe to a monthly savings amount for a period of three years: at the end of the three year period, the employee is allowed to either receive their saved amount plus interest or purchase shares in the Company at a price based on the average share price on the three days prior to commencement of the SAYE scheme, discounted by 20%.
This scheme is open to all employees subject to Inland Revenue approved limits on total investment, and invitations are issued at regular intervals.
Employees have a period of six months following the conclusion of the scheme to exercise their option to purchase shares.

84 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 30 Share-based payments continued The fair values of the share option and share award grants were based on the following inputs: SAYE Schemes The inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 6.40 5.89 7.85 12.00 Weighted average exercise price 5.84 5.16 7.81 9.09 Expected volatility 50% 51% 44% 51% Expected life 3 years 3 years Risk free rate 4.93% 4.72% 4.36% 4.54% Expected dividends 0% 0% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a three year period, equivalent to the vesting period of the options.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Company Share Option Plan CSOP The inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 6.16 7.65 10.41 14.73 Weighted average exercise price 6.45 7.86 9.99 13.79 Expected volatility 49% 51% 44% 48% Expected life 3 4 years 3 4 years Risk free rate 4.24% 5.40% 4.17% 4.52% Expected dividends 0% 0% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a time period equivalent to the vesting period of the options.
The adjustments for the performance conditions are reflected in the proportion of options anticipated to vest.
Starter Grants The inputs to the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted average share price 6.16 7.50 6.85 14.13 Weighted average exercise price 6.45 7.57 6.27 12.92 Expected volatility 53% 54% 44% 54% Expected life 3 5 years 3 5 years Risk free rate 4.80% 5.25% 4.17% 4.60% Expected dividends 0% 0% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over a time period equivalent to the vesting period of the options.
Retention award The fair value was based upon the share price on the date of grant.
Performance Awards The fair value was based upon Monte-Carlo simulation of the performance of the 39 comparator companies included in the TSR conditions of the award.
Expected volatility for each company was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the individual companys share price over the three years from the date of grant.
Share option charges The Group recognised total expenses of $9,275,000 2006: $7,836,000 related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
31 Retirement benefits scheme The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.

As at 28 December 2007, contributions of $nil 2006: $894,000 due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the scheme.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 85 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 32 Financial instruments Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Credit risk Market risk Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
Capital risk management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
CSR intends to reinvest its cash balances in the business either through higher levels of investment in working capital and fixed assets or through further M&A activity to support the long-term ambitions of the Group.
The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents, treasury deposits and equity attributable to the equity holders of CSR plc, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 25 and 26.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
As a result of the funds raised through the initial public offering in March 2004 and the subsequent positive operating cash flows, the Group has a total of $245.4 million of treasury deposits and cash and cash equivalents at 28 December 2007 2006: $147.5 million.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3 to the financial statements.
Categories of financial instruments Carrying value 2007 2006 $000 $000 Financial assets Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits 333,966 244,168 Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 696 4,522 334,662 248,690 Financial liabilities Derivative instruments in designated hedge accounting relationships 1,080 Amortised cost 113,731 59,804 114,811 59,804 Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate risk will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
Foreign currency risk management Substantially all of the Groups sales and costs of sales are denominated in US dollars, the Groups functional currency.
A majority of the Groups fixed costs are denominated in Sterling.
This exposure to different currencies would result in gains or losses with respect to movements in foreign exchange rates and the impact of such fluctuations could be material.
Accordingly, the Group enters into hedging transactions pursuant to which it purchases Sterling under forward purchase contracts in order to cover the majority of its Sterling exposure.
86 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 32 Financial instruments continued Market risk continued Foreign currency risk management continued The carrying amounts of the Groups Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 GBP Sterling 9,051 8,529 7,669 3,362 The following significant exchange rates applied during the period: Weighted average forward contract rate contracts maturing in the period Period end spot rate US Dollars 2007 2006 2007 2006 GBP 1.8877 1.8026 1.9905 1.9586 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to foreign currency movements for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have decreased equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible charge given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2006.
Equity Profit or loss 28 December 2007 $000 $000 GBP 10,919 1,052 Equity Profit or loss 29 December 2006 $000 $000 GBP 4,687 281 A 10% weakening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
The movement in profit for the period is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to exchange movements in sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the changes in fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur: Expected Cash flow hedges Carrying Amount cash flows 3 months or less 3-6 months 6-12 months More than one year 2007 Forward foreign exchange contracts $000 384 178,628 35,853 35,636 71,568 35,571 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 90,090 18,090 18,000 36,000 18,000 2006 Forward foreign exchange contracts 4,522 89,441 21,677 22,063 45,701 Forward foreign exchange contracts 000 48,000 12,000 12,000 24,000 The Directors consider the periods in which the cash flows associated with the derivatives that are cash flow hedges are expected to occur approximate the periods when the cash flows associated with those cash flows are likely to impact profit or loss.
Interest rate risk management The Group has no significant direct exposure to fluctuations in interest rates other than those on interest-bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those cash balances in the period was 5.16% 2006: 5.00%.
CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 87 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 Continued 32 Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Group only transacts with entities that are rated the equivalent of investment grade and above.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and if not available, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
For cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, the Company only transacts with entities that are equivalent to investment grade and above and Group treasury policy dictates that less than 20% of the total balance on cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits will be deposited with counterparties who have a Moodys credit rating of less than Aa1.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are in note 18.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The contractual maturity of derivative financial instruments is considered in the Forward foreign exchange contracts section on page 87.

Derivatives: The fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract and discounted back to the balance sheet date using an appropriate discount rate.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements approximates their fair values.
