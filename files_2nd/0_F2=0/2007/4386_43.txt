AcquisitioN of suBsiDiAriEs a Ener Petroleum ASA subsequently renamed Dana Petroleum Norway AS On 12 June 2007 the Company signed conditional subscription and acquisition agreements for shares in the Norwegian independent oil company Ener Petroleum ASA 'Ener', a company listed on the Norwegian OTC market.
The Company agreed terms to conditionally subscribe for 1,518,750 new shares in Ener at a subscription price of NOK 160 per share, representing approximately 53% of the fully diluted share capital of Ener following the issuance of the new shares to Dana.
In addition, the Company entered into share acquisition agreements for the purchase of certain existing shares in Ener, all at a price per share of NOK 220 payable in cash.
These initiatives delivered control of approximately 93.7% of the total shares in Ener, following completion on 11 July 2007 and upon regulatory approvals from the Norwegian Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and The Norwegian Ministry of Finance.
Thereafter a formal process was instigated to acquire the remaining minority shareholdings.
This deal represents an important step for the Company as it creates a substantial business in Norway with the technical and financial strength to build further.
The Ener transaction adds further to the Group's production and reserves and most importantly accelerates a portfolio of attractive business opportunities in Norway.
The Group also now has in place an excellent technical team in Norway which is focused on delivering further growth.
These factors support the goodwill arising on acquisition.
The transaction has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting with an effective date of 11 July 2007, being the date that the Group gained control of 93.7% of the total shares in Ener.
The Group has consolidated the results of Ener from the date of acquisition.
The fair value allocation to the former Ener assets is preliminary in nature and will be reviewed in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations within the specified 12 month period from completion date.
Due to the inherently uncertain nature of the oil and gas industry and intangible exploration evaluation assets in particular, the assumptions underlying the preliminary assigned values are judgemental in nature.
To the extent that the purchase consideration exceeds the aggregate of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of Ener, then goodwill has been recognised and recorded on the acquisition.
Deferred tax has also been recognised in respect of the fair value adjustments as applicable and incorporated into the calculation of goodwill shown opposite.
