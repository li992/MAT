The Group has an International Share Award Plan ISAP which is used to reward exceptional performance amongst employees.
An expense is recognised for the fair value at the date of grant of the estimated number of shares that will be awarded to settle the options over the vesting period of each scheme.
Share award fair values The fair value is measured using the valuation technique that is considered to be the most appropriate to value each class of award: these include Binomial models, Black-Scholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
These valuations take into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

2 The fair value calculation of a discretionary share option uses an expected life to the point of expected exercise.
This is determined through analysis of historical evidenced exercise patterns of option holders.
Cadbury Schweppes Annual Report & Accounts 2007 113 Financial statements continued 26.
Share-based payments continued Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous 3 years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The BSRP is available to a group of approximately 115 senior executives including the executive Directors.
Also during the period, matching awards were made over 1,706,860 shares 2006: 1,676,061.
The fair value of the shares under the plan is based on the market price of the Companys ordinary shares on the date of the award.
Where the awards do not attract dividends during the vesting period, the market price is reduced by the present value of the dividends expected to be paid during the expected life of the awards.
Awards made under this scheme are classified as equity settled.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 16 million 2006: 9 million.
Around 80 senior executives including the executive Directors are granted a conditional award of shares under the LTIP.
The expense recognised in respect of these awards was 6 million 2006: 6 million.
