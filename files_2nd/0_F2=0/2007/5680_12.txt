74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 43 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies General information Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC the 'company' is a company incorporated in the UK.
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the 'group' and equity-account the group's interest in associates and jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the entity and not about its group.
The group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have a significant effect on the financial statements, and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year, are discussed in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new accounting standards, or amendments and interpretations to existing standards have not been applied as they are not yet effective: IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2007 : Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009 : IFRIC 11 'IFRS 2 - Group and Treasury Share Transactions' effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2007 : IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2008 : Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs effective for annual periods beginning on or after July 1 2009 : and IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1 2009.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures.
In addition, certain other standards and interpretations were issued during the period which either do not apply to the group or are not expected to have any material effect.
Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts incorporate the accounts of the company and entities controlled by the company its 'subsidiaries'.
Control is achieved where the company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
A joint venture is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise joint control over the financial and operating policies of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Where the group owns a non-controlling interest in the equity share capital of a non-quoted company and does not exercise significant influence, it is held as an investment and stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The results of subsidiary and associated undertakings acquired during the year are incorporated from the effective date of acquisition.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method, with consideration given and the assets and liabilities acquired being recorded at fair value.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the group's equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minority's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minority interest in the subsidiary's equity are allocated against the interests of the group except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 43 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 44 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Revenue Turnover represents income from advertising, subscriptions, sponsorship and delegate fees, net of value added tax.
Advertising revenues are recognized in the income statement on the date of publication.
Subscription revenues are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the subscription.
Sponsorship and delegate revenues are recognized in the income statement over the period the event is run.
Revenues invoiced but relating to future periods are deferred and treated as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The group uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks, including forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps.
All derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The recognition of gains or losses on derivative instruments depends on whether the instrument is designated as a hedge and the type of exposure it is designed to hedge.
The effective portion of gains or losses on cash flow hedges are deferred in equity until the impact from the hedged item is recognized in the income statement.
The ineffective portion of such gains and losses is recognized in the income statement immediately.
Gains or losses on the qualifying part of net investment hedges are recognized in equity together with the gains and losses on the underlying net investment.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement as they arise.
The premium or discount on interest rate instruments is recognized as part of net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Liabilities for put options over the remaining minority interests in subsidiaries are recorded in the balance sheet at their estimated discounted present value.
These discounts are unwound and charged to the income statement as notional interest over the period up to the date of the potential future payment.
In respect of options over further interests in joint ventures and associates, only movements in their fair value are recognized.
Foreign currencies The functional and presentation currency of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC and its UK subsidiaries is Sterling.
The functional currency of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income statements of overseas operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year and their balance sheets are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences arising on consolidation are taken to equity.
In the event of the disposal of an operation, the related cumulative translation differences are recognised in the income statement in the period of disposal.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings and derivative instruments, to the extent that they are used to provide a hedge against the groups equity investments in overseas undertakings, are taken to equity together with the exchange difference arising on the net investment in those undertakings.
All other exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line or other systematic basis as allowed by IAS 17 'Leases. '
44 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 45 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions Contributions to pension schemes in respect of current and past service, ex-gratia pensions, and cost of living adjustments to existing pensions are based on the advice of independent actuaries.
Payments to the Euromoney Pension Plan and the Metal Bulletin Group Personal Pension Plan, defined contribution pension schemes, are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The company operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme, a defined benefit scheme.
The cost of providing benefits is determined by triennial valuations using the attained age method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognized past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
The company also participates in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, a defined benefit pension scheme which is operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plan as a whole to the individual entities, the company recognises an expense equal to its contributions payable in the period and does not recognise any unfunded liability of this pension scheme on its balance sheet.
Earnings per share The earnings per share and diluted earnings per share calculations follow the provisions of IAS 33 'Earnings per share. '
The diluted earnings per share figure is calculated by adjusting for the dilution effect of the exercise of all ordinary share options, SAYE options and the Capital Appreciation Plan options granted by the company, but excluding the ordinary shares held by the Euromoney Employees Share Ownership Trust.
Depreciation Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided on the straight-line basis over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Freehold land and buildings 2% Long-term leasehold premises over term of lease Short-term leasehold premises over term of lease Office equipment 11% 33% Motor vehicles 20% All tangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets' when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount, less provision for impairment.
A provision is made and charged to the income statement when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash, short-term deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Dividends Dividends are recognized as an expense in the period in which they are approved by the company's shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the period in which they are paid.
Own shares held by Employees' Share Ownership trust Transactions of the group-sponsored trust are included in the group financial statements.
In particular, the trust's holdings of shares in the company are debited direct to equity.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 45 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 46 Notes to the Accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued Provisions A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If it is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the net fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units that have benefited from the acquisition.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or where there is an indication that goodwill may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, then the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of the goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit on a pro rata basis.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and may not subsequently be reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit and loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on foreign subsidiary investments held in the consolidated balance sheet are retranslated into Sterling at the applicable period end exchange rates.
Any exchange differences arising are taken directly to equity as part of the retranslation of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts having been tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP before October 1 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
An intangible asset will be recognised as long as the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights, and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Amortisation is charged so as to write off the costs of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line or reducing balance method.
All intangible assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of assets' when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The costs of acquiring and developing software that is not integral to the related hardware is capitalised separately as an intangible asset.
These intangibles are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation Amortisation of intangible assets is provided on a reducing balance basis or straight-line basis as appropriate over their expected useful lives at the following rates per year: Brands 20 30 years Data providers contracts 5 years Customer relationships 3 16 years Business combinations achieved in stages Where a business combination is achieved by more than one exchange transaction, goodwill is calculated separately for each transaction with the appropriate share of the acquiree's net assets based on the net fair values at the time of each exchange transaction.
Any adjustment to fair values related to previously held interests is a revaluation which is accounted for as an adjustment to equity.
Purchases and sale of shares in a controlled entity Where the group's interest in a controlled entity increases, which does not result in a change of control, the group calculates the goodwill arising as the difference between the cost of the additional interest acquired and the fair value of the group's interest in the subsidiary's net assets at the date of the change in interest.
All of the assets and liabilities are fair valued at the date of acquisition of the additional controlling stake.
46 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 47 1 Accounting policies continued Share-based payments The group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
At the period end the vesting assumptions are revisited and the charge associated with the fair value of these options updated.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 'Share-based payments' has been applied to all grants of options after November 7 2002, that were unvested at October 1 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
For cash settled share based payments a liability equal to the portion of the goods and services received is recognised at the current fair value as determined at each balance sheet date.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is calculated under the provisions of IAS 12 'Income tax' and is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the accounts and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
No provision is made for temporary differences on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries, joint ventures or associates where the group has control and the reversal of the temporary difference is not foreseeable.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the group intends to settle its current assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are items of income or expense considered by the directors, either individually or if of a similar type in aggregate, as being either material or significant and which require disclosure in order to provide a view of the group's results excluding these items.
2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts The group prepares its group financial statements in accordance with IFRS, the application of which often requires judgements to be made by management when formulating the groups financial position and results.
Under IFRS, the directors are required to adopt those accounting policies most appropriate to the groups circumstances for the purpose of presenting fairly the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially affect the reported results or net asset position of the group should it later be determined that a different choice would have been more appropriate.
Management considers the accounting estimates and assumptions discussed below to be its key judgemental areas and, accordingly, provides an explanation of each below.
Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the groups Audit Committee.
The discussion below should also be read in conjunction with the groups disclosure of IFRS accounting policies, which is provided in note 1.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 47 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 48 Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Acquisitions The groups accounting policy is that on acquisition of a subsidiary or business, the purchase consideration is allocated over the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, with any excess purchase consideration representing goodwill.
Fair value Determining the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired requires management's judgement and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, recoverability of assets, and unprovided liabilities and commitments particularly in relation to tax and VAT.
Intangible assets The group makes an assessment of the fair value of intangible assets arising on acquisitions.
The measurement of the fair value of intangible assets acquired requires significant management judgement particularly in relation to the expected future cash flows from the acquired marketing databases which are generally based on managements estimate of marketing response rates, trademarks, brands, repeat and well established events.
At September 30 2007 the net book value of intangible assets was 131.5 million 2006: 2.6 million.
Goodwill Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment.
Goodwill is impaired where the carrying value of goodwill is higher than the net present value of future cash flows of those cash generating units to which it relates.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the net present value are the forecast cash flows, the long term growth rate of the applicable businesses and the discount rate applied to those cash flows.
Based on the latest valuations, no goodwill was impaired at September 30 2007.
Goodwill held on the balance sheet at September 30 2007 was 248.1 million 2006: 68.5 million.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions The group has subsidiaries or businesses that were acquired by the group where payment for part of that entity is made at a later date at a price determined by post acquisition profits.
Where this is the case, the net present value of the estimated deferred payment is recognised as a liability on the balance sheet with a corresponding increase in goodwill.
These discounts are unwound as an interest charge to the income statement.
In estimating the deferred payment management make assumptions on the post acquisition future earnings of the acquired entity and on an appropriate discount rate.
The deferred consideration is re-estimated regularly and, should the actual deferred payment be different to that estimated a correction is required to goodwill, the amount of cash paid to be paid and the interest charge.
At September 30 2007 the present value of the deferred consideration on acquisitions was nil 2006: 8.1 million.
Acquisition option commitments The group is party to a number of put and call options over the remaining minority interests in some of its subsidiaries.
IAS 39 requires the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments to be recognised as a liability on the balance sheet with a corresponding decrease in reserves.
The discounts are unwound as a notional interest charge to the income statement.
Key areas of judgement in calculating the discounted present value of the options are the expected future cash flows and earnings of the business, the period remaining until the option is exercised and the discount rate.
At September 30 2007 the discounted present value of these acquisition option commitments was 33.3 million 2006: 24.3 million.
Share-based payments The group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the group's share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
These assumptions are set out in note 23.
Management regularly perform a trueup of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest, which is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
The Capital Appreciation Plan is explained in detail in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
The number of shares available for award is dependent on the future profits of the group up to at least 2009 which, in addition to the key assumptions above, management are required to estimate.
A fall in the estimate of these profits would result in a lower cumulative charge to the income statement.
The charge for share-based payments for the year ended September 30 2007 is 10.2 million 2006: 4.4 million.
48 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 49 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Defined benefit pension scheme The surplus or deficit in the defined benefit pension scheme that is recognised through the statement of recognised income and expense is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties.
The calculated liabilities of the scheme are based on assumptions regarding salary increases, inflation rates, discount rates, the long term expected return on the schemes assets and member longevity.
Details of the assumptions used are shown in note 6.
Such assumptions are based on actuarial advice and are benchmarked against similar pension schemes.
Taxation The groups tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges.
The calculation of the groups total tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority or, as appropriate, through a formal legal process.
The final resolution of some of these items may give rise to material profit and loss and or cash flow variances.
The group is a multi-national group with tax affairs in many geographical locations.
This inherently leads to a higher than usual complexity to the groups tax structure and makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the group and it is often dependent on the efficiency of the legislative processes in the relevant taxing jurisdictions in which the group operates.
Issues can, and often do, take many years to resolve.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the tax charge in the income statement and tax payments.
The group has certain significant open items in several tax jurisdictions and as a result the amounts recognised in the group financial statements in respect of these items are derived from the groups best estimation and judgement, as described above.
However, the inherent uncertainty regarding the outcome of these items means eventual resolution could differ from the accounting estimates and therefore affect the groups results and cash flows.
Recognition of deferred tax assets The recognition of net deferred tax assets is based upon whether it is probable that sufficient and suitable taxable profits will be available in the future, against which the reversal of temporary differences can be deducted.
Recognition, therefore, involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group in which the deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Historical differences between forecast and actual taxable profits have not resulted in material adjustments to the recognition of deferred tax assets.
At September 30 2007, the group had a deferred tax asset of 11.5 million 2006: 22.9 million.
Treasury Interest rate exposure Interest rate swaps and caps are used to manage the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its floating rate borrowings.
The maturity profile of these derivatives is matched with the expected future debt profile of the group.
The groups policy is to fix the interest rates on approximately 80% of its term debt looking forward over five years.
The expected future debt profile of the group is based on estimates of both timings and size of future, as yet unknown, acquisitions offset by an estimate of the cash generated by the group over a five year period.
If management materially underestimate the group's future debt profile this would lead to too few interest rate instruments being in place and the group more exposed to swings in interest rates.
An overestimate of the group's future debt profile would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess interest rate instruments.
At September 30 2007, the fair value of the group's interest rate swaps was a liability 0.6 million 2006: asset of 2.1 million.
Forward contracts The group is exposed to foreign exchange risk in the form of transactions in foreign currencies entered into by group companies and by the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling for reporting purposes.
The group does not hedge the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries, consequently, fluctuations in the value of pounds sterling versus currencies could materially affect the amount of these items in the consolidated financial statements, even if their values has not changed in their original currency.
The group does endeavour to match foreign currency borrowings to investments in order to provide a natural hedge for the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 49 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 50 Notes to the Accounts continued 2 Key judgemental areas adopted in preparing these accounts continued Approximately 60% of the groups revenues are in US dollars.
Subsidiaries normally do not hedge transactions in foreign currencies into the functional currency of their own operations.
However, at a group level a series of US dollar forward contracts is put in place up to 48 months forward partially to hedge its dollar revenues into sterling.
The timing and value of these forward contracts is based on managements estimate of its future US dollar revenues over a 48 month period.
If management materially underestimated the group's future US dollar revenues this would lead to too few forward contracts being in place and the group being more exposed to swings in US dollar to sterling exchange rates.
An overestimate of the group's US dollar revenue would lead to associated costs in unwinding the excess forward contracts.
At September 30 2007, the fair value of the group's forward contracts was an asset of 8.1 million 2006: 1.0 million.
Details of the financial instruments used are set out in note 18 to the accounts.

In August 2007 the group sold its equity interest in Med Ad Inc, a leading provider of marketing and clinical research information to the pharmaceutical industry, resulting in a profit of 5.0 million note 15 and a corresponding tax charge of 1.9 million.
Subsequent to the acquisition of Metal Bulletin plc in October 2006 note 14 the group has restructured and reorganised the acquired group's operations and incurred associated costs of 5.9 million.
This primarily includes restructuring costs and provisions for onerous property leases.
This results in a related tax credit of 1.3 million.

The Plan is a part of the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits are also held under this trust.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Fidelity Pension Management.

The scheme is closed to new members.
The investment and administration of the plan is undertaken by Skandia Life Group.
Private schemes Institutional Investor, Inc. contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
Stakeholder pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.
Harmsworth Pension Scheme The Harmsworth Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme operated by Daily Mail and General Trust plc providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a trustee company which is required to act in the best interests of the beneficiaries of the scheme.
The contributions payable to the scheme are determined by the trustee company after taking advice from an independent qualified actuary, and following agreement with the company.
This scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at March 31 2004 using the projected unit credit method and the key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: Long-term assumed rate of: Investment return 7.0% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities 6.6% p. a.
The company cash contribution rate to the Harmsworth Pension Scheme during the year ended September 30 2007 was 18% of pensionable salaries 2006: 18%.
Work in connection with the actuarial valuations of the scheme as at March 31 2007 has already begun but the results are not expected to become available until early 2008.
The Harmsworth Pension Scheme has a two-tiered benefit structure represented by a Standard section and a Pension section.
In the Standard section, employees pay contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries and have benefits based on a normal retirement age of 65.
Under the Pension section, employees currently pay contributions of 7.5% and enjoy a higher benefit accrual rate and lower normal retirement age than in the Standard section.
Members are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the Daily Mail and General Trust plc, or the company, from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the valuation of assets and liabilities reported below.
The Daily Mail and General Trust plc, as principal employer for the schemes, has informed the trustees of its two main defined benefit schemes, one of which is the Harmsworth Pension Scheme, of its intention to merge these schemes.
The trustees of both schemes have set up a sub-committee to consider the impact of the merger and, in particular, to ensure that the benefits and interests of all scheme members are protected.
There will be no change in the benefits provided to any members as a result of the merger.
It is expected that the merger will be completed by November 30 2007.
The company's pension charge for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme for the year ended September 30 2007 was 184,000 2006: 243,000.
A prepayment of 143,000 2006: 209,000 is included under debtors, representing prepaid contributions for the year to September 30 2008 paid in accordance with the schedule of contributions currently in force.
56 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 57 6 Staff costs continued The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
The ultimate parent company, Daily Mail and General Trust plc, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under International Accounting Standard 19 'Employee Benefits' IAS 19.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of Daily Mail and General Trust plc have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2007, and adjusted to September 30 2007 by the actuary.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 650.0 million 2006: 602.3 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 106% 2006: 90% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations and disclosures required under IAS 19 for the financial statements of Daily Mail and General Trust plc are not materially different to the valuations and disclosures required under FRS 17.
Defined benefit scheme The company operates the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme closed to new members, a defined benefit scheme.
Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme The acquisition by the group of Metal Bulletin plc on October 6 2006 included a defined benefit obligation in respect of the Metal Bulletin plc Pension Scheme MBPS.
As a result, at that date the company acquired a defined benefit obligation of 21.7 million along with a fair value of pension scheme assets of 17.7 million resulting in a net pension liability of 4.0 million.
The impact of the acquisition of MBPS on the balance sheet disclosures, and the subsequent pension costs arising, are included in the figures reported below.
The MBPS is a defined benefit scheme providing service-related benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances, being invested with the Norwich Union Life Insurance Society, Schroder Investment Management Ltd, and certain other specific investments managed directly by the Trustees.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees' working lives with the group.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme, upon which the current contributions are based, was carried out as at June 1 2004.
The company cash contribution rate to the scheme during the year was 22.8% of pensionable salaries.
This MBPS is closed to new members.
The figures in this note are based on calculations carried out in connection with the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at June 1 2004 and adjusted to September 30 2007 by the actuary.
The key financial assumptions adopted were as follows: 2007 2006 Long-term assumed rate of: Pensionable salary growth 4.6% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment pre January 1997 members 5.0% p. a.
Pension escalation in payment limited price escalation post January 1997 members 3.3% p. a.
Discount rate for accrued liabilities 5.9% p. a.
Pension increase in deferment 3.3% p. a.
The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Assumptions on mortality will be reviewed as part of the actuarial valuation as at June 1 2007.
The results of this valuation are not expected to become known until 2008.

Having taken account of the rules of the scheme, the fact that the scheme remains open to new accrual, and the current levels of service cost and cash contributions, the company considers that recognition of the scheme's surplus on its balance sheet is in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14.
The surplus for the year excludes a related deferred tax liability of 109,000.

The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Forecasts by business based on pre-tax cash flows derived from approved budgets for 2008.
Management believe these budgets to be reasonably achievable: Subsequent cash flows for between one and three additional years were increased in line with growth expectations of the applicable business: The pre-tax discount rate used was 8.7%, the same as that used in assessing potential acquisitions: and Long term growth rate assumed to be 3%.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.

18 Financial instruments Details of the objectives policies and strategies pursued by the group in relation to financial instruments are set out on page 44 of the accounting policies and pages 49 and 50 of the key judgemental areas.
The main financial risks faced by the group are market risks including the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and liquidity risks.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exists.
Derivatives used for hedging a particular risk are not specialised and are generally available from numerous sources.
Liquidity risk The group's liquidity risk is described in detail in section 4 of the Directors' Report.
Fixed and floating rate borrowings analysed by maturity are analysed below.
Borrowings are shown after taking account of related interest rate derivatives in designated hedging relationships: 2007 2006 Variable Fixed Variable Fixed rate rate Total rate rate Total borrowings borrowings value borrowings borrowings value 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Within one year 17,731 17,731 58,666 58,666 after 2 years but within 3 years 45,486 168,073 213,559 2,361 63,169 65,530 63,217 168,073 231,290 61,027 63,169 124,196 At September 30 2007, 130.6 million 2006: 104.0 million of borrowings were designated in US dollars with the remainder in sterling.
The average rate of interest paid on the debt was 6.09% 2006: 3.2%.
Interest rate risks The group's interest rate risk is described in detail in section 4 of the Directors' Report.
The group's interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at optimising net interest cost and reducing volatility.
This is achieved by modifying the interest rate exposure of debt and cash positions through the use of interest rate swaps.
At September 30 2007, interest rates were fixed for 82% of the group's net cash and borrowing positions 2006: 86%.
At September 30 2007, the fair value of the group's interest rate swaps was a liability of 0.6 million 2006: asset 2.1 million.
The following sensitivity analysis of borrowings and derivative financial instruments to interest rate movements assumes an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates across all the groups borrowings and derivative instruments, regardless of their currencies and maturities, from their levels at September 30 2007.
All other variables are held constant.
The directors regard these change assumptions as reasonably possible over a one year period.
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 71 74574 NOTES 11 12 07 22:35 Page 72 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued A 100 basis point reduction in interest rates would result in an estimated decrease in the group's net interest expense of 0.4 million, based on the composition of financial instruments including cash, cash equivalents and bank loans as at September 30 2007.
A 100 basis point rise in interest rates would result in an estimated increase in the group's net interest expense of 0.4 million.
The sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments at September 30 2007 to changes in interest rates is set out in the table below: Fair value Carrying 100 basis 100 basis fair value points points 000s 000s 000s Short-term borrowings 17,731 17,731 17,731 Long-term borrowings 213,559 225,355 225,355 Interest rate swaps liability asset 596 3,173 4,365 Short-term borrowings comprise bank loans, net loans from DMGT companies and overdrafts due within one year.
Long-term borrowings include only long-term loans.
A 100 point basis change in interest rate would not result in a material change to the fair value of any other financial instrument.
Foreign exchange rate risk The group's foreign exchange rate risk is described in detail in section 4 of the Directors' Report.
The group operates in many countries and is subject to risks from changes in foreign currency values, particularly US dollars.
These exposures are hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
At September 30 2007, the fair value of the group's currency derivatives is estimated to be 8.1 million 2006: 1.0 million and included as a current asset in the group's balance sheet.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All currency derivatives have been designated as hedges and tested as effective.
The movements in fair values have been deferred to equity.
The following sensitivity analysis of net borrowings and derivative financial instruments to foreign exchange rate movements assumes an immediate 5% change in all foreign exchange rates against sterling from their levels at September 30 2007.
All other variables remain constant.
A 5% change indicates a strengthening of the currency against sterling and a -5% change indicates a weakening of the currency against sterling.
The directors regard these change assumptions as reasonably possible over a oneyear period.
All foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges of future forecast transactions.

Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate of between 0.4% and 1.6% above LIBOR dependent on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
At September 30 2006, the group had not drawn down on this facility but remained a borrower under its existing five-year committed facility.
During October 2006 the group, funded by the new multi-currency facility, repaid all monies owing on its then existing committed facility and drew down further amounts to fund the purchase of Metal Bulletin plc and to settle related acquired debt.
As at September 30 2007 there were 86.4 million 2006: 200.4 million of other uncommitted un-drawn facilities directly available to the group.
Loan notes Loan notes for 12.7 million were issued in October and November 2006 to fund the purchase of Metal Bulletin plc.
Interest is payable on these loan notes at a variable rate of 0.75% below LIBOR payable in June and December.
Loan notes can be redeemed at the option of the loan note holder twice a year on the interest payment dates above.
At least 20 business days' written notice prior to the redemption date is required.
At the end of June 2007, 0.9 million of these loan notes were redeemed reducing the debt to 11.8 million.

A deferred tax asset of 1,317,000 2006: 3,722,000 has been recognized.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The losses have expiry dates of January 2026.
A net deferred tax asset of 10,190,000 2006: 14,317,000 has been recognized in respect of US tax deductible goodwill amortisation and other overseas short-term timing differences.
The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, it is probable that the level of profits in the future years are sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 5,404,000 has not been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses and other short term temporary differences 2006: 5,975,000 as the directors do not believe there is sufficient evidence that it is probable they will be recovered.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 86,062,000 2006: 65,611,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the company for an exercise price of 0.25p per ordinary share.
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on September 30 2014.
The initial performance condition increased during 2007 to reflect the acquisition of Metal Bulletin was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool a maximum of 7.5 million shares will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards.
One third of the awards will vest on February 14 2008, with the other two thirds vesting in equal tranches in the following two years, but only if the primary and secondary performance conditions are met page 27.
Otherwise vesting is deferred until both the profit target of 57 million achieved in 2007 is achieved again, and the profits of the individual participants businesses are at least 75% of that achieved in 2007 but no later than by reference to the year ending September 30 2012.
Share Option Schemes The company has 12 share option schemes for which an IFRS 2 'Share based payments' charge has been recognized.
Details of these schemes are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 25 to 35.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are shown below: The executive and Save as You Earn Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the group's share price over the previous 14 years.
The executive options' fair values have been discounted at a rate of 10% to reflect their performance conditions.
The expected term of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The expense recognised in the year in respect of these options was 202,000 2006: 121,000.

This decrease is reported as finance income in the income statement.
New option commitments of 18,533,000 have been recognised relating to subsidiaries acquired in the year and existing options have been exercised totalling 7,248,000.
As at September 30 2007, the discounted present value of the remaining put option commitments is 33,335,000 2006: 24,332,000.
