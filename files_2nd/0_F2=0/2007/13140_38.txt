Combined financial statements 108 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 7 Share based remuneration Reed Elsevier provides a number of share based remuneration schemes to directors and employees.
The principal share based remuneration schemes are the Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, the Retention Share Plan RSP and the Bonus Investment Plan BIP.
Share options granted under ESOS and LTIP are exercisable after three years and up to ten years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
Conditional shares granted under ESOS, LTIP, RSP and BIP are exercisable after three years for nil consideration if conditions are met.
Other awards principally relate to all employee share saving schemes in the UK and the Netherlands.
Share based remuneration awards are, other than in exceptional circumstances, subject to the condition that the employee remains in employment at the time of exercise.
Share options and conditional shares granted under LTIP, RSP and BIP are subject to the achievement of growth targets of Reed Elsevier PLC and Reed Elsevier NV adjusted earnings per share measured at constant exchange rates.
LTIP grants made in 2006 and 2007 are variable subject to the achievement of an additional total shareholder return performance target.
The numbers of share options and conditional shares included in the tables below are calculated on the basis that 100% of the awards will vest.
Further details of performance conditions are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 51 to 75.
