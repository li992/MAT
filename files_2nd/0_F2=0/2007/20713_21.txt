co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 54 2 Risk management policy and control framework The Groups risk management governance structure is composed of several committees that have responsibility for key risk management areas.
An illustration of how these committees report up to the Group Board is provided below: Group Board Group Audit Group Risk Executive Committee Committee Committee Commercial Bank Assets and Retail Risk Commercial Risk Model Validation Group Operational Financial Crime Credit Sanctioning Liabilities Committee Committee Committee Risk Committee Steering Group Committee Committee Large Credit Retail Commercial Credit Market Risk Operational Risk Fraud Transactions Credit Risk Credit Risk Models Liquidity Risk Business Risk Money Laundering Funding Risk Controls Compliance The main roles of the committees are as follows: Group Risk Committee GRC GRC considers and approves on behalf of the Group Board the Groups risk management framework, its risk appetite and its key risk management policies for all risk categories.
The Committee also monitors key risk management information and reviews the Groups including Treasury overall capital adequacy.
The Chairman of GRC reports to the Group Board on the Committees activities quarterly.
Group Audit Committee GAC GAC approves the Groups financial statements, manages the relationship with the Groups external auditors, reviews reports on the operation of internal controls and monitors control issues of major significance to the Group.
Executive Committee EC EC acts as the Groups senior executive committee, ensuring that it meets its strategic and operational objectives.
Model Validation Committee MVC MVC provides an independent review and validation of the Groups internal ratings models to ensure that the systems are producing consistent and accurate results to support pricing, lending decisions, asset quality monitoring and capital adequacy.
Assets and Liabilities Committee ALCO ALCO recommends Group policy in relation to liquidity and funding, market risk, trading policy and treasury delegations, and monitors compliance with these policies.
ALCO is also responsible for considering and agreeing the economic capital framework, and for considering the Groups capital structure.
Group Operational Risk Committee GORC GORC reviews and approves the Groups key operational risk management policies, monitors the Groups exposure to operational risks and reviews the arrangements for measuring and controlling operational risks.
Financial Crime Steering Group FCSG FCSG exists to facilitate a coordinated and effective response to financial crime across the Group, focusing primarily on implementing the Groups strategy on anti-money laundering and anti-fraud measures.
Retail Risk Committee RRC RRC reviews credit risk, fraud, money laundering and other risk reports relating to Retail Banking, as well as approving changes to policy prior to their submission to the GRC for formal ratification.
This committee meets on a monthly basis and is chaired by the Group Chief Executive.
Commercial Risk Committee CRC CRC reviews credit risk, fraud, money laundering and other risk reports relating to the Commercial Bank, as well as approving changes to policy prior to their submission to the GRC for formal ratification.
This committee meets on a monthly basis and is chaired by the Managing Director, Commercial Banking.
Commercial Bank Credit Sanctioning Committee CBCSC CBCSC considers and approves applications for commercial credit in excess of predefined risk limits.
Loans approved by CBCSC are reported to both the Group Board and GRC.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 The most significant risk types to which the Group is exposed are discussed below: i Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events.
The Group sub-divides the operational risk category by type such as criminal, legal, regulatory, environmental, systems failure and personnel risk.
Operational risk policies are in place for key operational activities: these policies set out how the Group manages the relevant risks.
The policies are approved by the GORC.
The Group manages its operational risks through a variety of techniques, including monitoring key risk indicators, internal controls, and various risk mitigation techniques, such as insurance and business continuity planning.
Risks are monitored through control and risk selfassessment, use of key risk indicators and analysis of actual and near miss loss data.
Risk self-assessment is undertaken by each business unit, specifying the likelihood and financial impact of specific operational risk events analysed by risk category, together with a narrative justification for each loss scenario identified.
Output from the self-assessment process is used to calculate the Groups operational risk unexpected loss and economic capital requirements.
GRC receives quarterly operational risk data, including realised loss data, near miss data and a dashboard which assesses the status of all key current and emerging operational risks using agreed key risk indicators.
A summary of the dashboard is submitted to the Group Board on a monthly basis.
In addition, senior management certify the effectiveness of the risk and control environment every six months.
A summary of the results of the certification process is presented to GRC.
An independent operational risk team within the Group Risk function has the overall responsibility for ensuring effective operation of the framework within which operational risk is managed, and for its consistent application across the Group.
Day to day management of operational risk rests with line managers.
Oversight of regulatory risk is the responsibility of the Group Risk and Compliance functions.
Group Risk has primary responsibility for oversight of prudential risks and Group Compliance for other regulatory risks.
The Group has established a regular forum, the Legal & Regulatory Risk Group, to ensure the Group is properly prepared for regulatory developments.
The Group has adopted the standardised approach for calculating the Pillar 1 capital requirements for operational risk.
ii Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a customer or counterparty failing to meet their financial obligations to the Group as and when they fall due.
The GRC approves the Groups credit risk appetite through approval of the Groups risk appetite statement and of business area lending and credit policies.
These policies define the risk appetite for each business area, including specifying risk and exposure limits.
The policies also define the types of lending that the Group is prepared to advance and set out how the Group limits its exposure to groups of counterparties and to concentration risk.
The Group uses a variety of analytical tools to assist with lending decisions, pricing, capital adequacy, stress testing, strategic planning and asset quality monitoring.
These tools include internal ratings based models, behavioural scoring and other scorecard based underwriting techniques.
The internal ratings based models are approved by the MVC and GRC.
In addition to the amounts shown on the balance sheet, the Group is also exposed to credit risk on guarantees, credit derivatives, irrevocable letters of credit and irrevocable undrawn loan facilities, as set out in Note 34.
The balance sheet does take into account any collateral held as security or other credit enhancement.
The Group is firmly committed to the management of credit risk in both its Retail and Commercial lending activities.
The types of financial instruments that are most exposed to credit risk are loans and advances to customers Note 18, net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts Note 20, operating lease assets Note 27, due from other banks Note 15, trading securities Note 16, derivative financial instruments Note 17, investment securities Note 21 and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Note 22.

Risks are managed in accordance with policy and asset quality plans which are approved by GRC.
Retail Credit & Risk uses a combination of lending policy criteria, credit scoring including behavioural scoring, policy rules and underwriting to make a decision on applications for credit.
The primary factors considered are affordability, residency, residential history, credit history, employment history, nature of income and loan to value.
In addition, confirmation of borrower identity and an assessment of the value of any security are undertaken prior to granting a credit facility.
When considering applications, the primary focus is placed on the willingness and ability to repay.
co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 56 2 Risk management policy and control framework continued Credit scoring is used to support the customer account management process in the following ways: To set customer maximum lending limits.
To pre-determine lending limits for selected further advances.
To determine account specific recommended limits and product types.
To set shadow limits to manage unauthorised borrowing.
The maximum mortgage loan available is based on the lower of the current value or purchase price of the property.
No lending is undertaken based solely upon security provided by the value of the underlying assets and all mortgages are secured by way of a first legal charge against the property.
In order to minimise delinquency problems progressing to more serious levels and ultimate loss, arrears procedures comply with the Financial Services Authority FSA requirements and the Handling of Arrears and Possessions Council of Mortgage Lenders Statement of Practice.
The arrears management team adopts a responsible and constructive stance to managing delinquency in order to protect the best interests of both the customer and the Bank.
Properties are only taken into possession when this is necessary to minimise loss.
All steps are taken to work with the customer to set up an achievable repayment plan so that the property possession only occurs as a last resort.
Asset quality monitoring, product pricing decisions, provisioning and capital requirements are all derived from the relevant internal ratings models.
These models segment retail portfolios into key probability of default and loss given default segments based on factors such as credit score and indexed loan to value.
The models generate both point in time and long run average estimates of probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default.
Retail Banking lending is made up of the following balances: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 Retail Banking: m m m m Secured: Residential mortgages 42,776 38,002 42,776 37,964 Other secured loans 74 32 11 14 42,850 38,034 42,787 37,978 Unsecured: Personal loans 3,748 3,555 55 Other unsecured loans 95 77 95 77 3,843 3,632 150 77 Total 46,693 41,666 42,937 38,055 All Retail Banking assets are held at amortised cost.
Of the total Retail balances, 91.6% 2006: 91.2% are secured on residential properties.
The remainder of the balances relate primarily to unsecured personal loans.
Residential mortgages and personal secured loans are only secured against UK properties.
Residential mortgages are distributed across the UK, with 75% 2006: 75% of residential mortgages being outside Greater London and the south east region.

The proportion of mortgage accounts over three months in arrears was 0.49% at the end of December 2007, lower than the 0.51% reported in December 2006 and significantly lower than the Council of Mortgage Lenders industry average of 1.20%.
The number of accounts in arrears at the end of December 2007 was lower than in December 2006.
The total value of arrears was 9.7m, compared to total mortgage balances of 42.8bn.
We continue to take a prudent approach to the capitalisation of mortgage arrears, with just 358,000 of arrears capitalised in 2007.
Repossessions across the industry increased over the past 12 months.
During 2007 our stock of properties in possession increased from 27 to 80, which represents only 0.02% of our total mortgage accounts, compared to the industry average of 0.10%.
Our repossessions during the year were 171 2006: 90.
To put this into context our repossessions have, in the preceding seven years, consistently reduced year on year from 1,239 in 1999 to a record low of 90 in 2006.
In unsecured personal lending our asset quality remains strong, with 5.5% of traditional unsecured lending balances over 30 days in arrears, lower than the 5.6% reported in December 2006 and in line with the 5.5% reported in June 2007.
The value of loans in arrears at the end of December 2007 was in line with December 2006 and lower than in June 2007.
The proportion of loans in arrears was over 45% better than the average for the Finance and Leasing Association members.
co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 58 2 Risk management policy and control framework continued Our new traditional unsecured personal lending in 2006 and 2007 continues to perform better than the lending undertaken in 2005, and we do not expect any significant change in the unsecured personal loan impairment loss charge in 2008.
We continue to take a prudent approach to lending, with around two thirds of applications unsuccessful in 2007.
The average value of a new loan in 2007 increased slightly to around 9,000.
IAS adjustments relate to effective interest rate calculations.
Collective provisions are set aside to cover losses on past due loans.
Individual provisions are made on loans that are individually significant in size and are special cases that are not adequately covered by collective provisioning methodology.
The carrying value of the repossessed stock properties in possession was 12.4m at 31 December 2007 2006: 2.6m, for which 11.9m 2006: 3.2m collateral was held.
These assets are not utilised by the Groups operations and are sold and converted to cash as soon as practicable.
Since the completion of mortgage applications 1.2m 2006: 1.1m of mortgages that would have been past due or impaired, have had their terms renegotiated during the term of the loan.
These loans have been restructured or renegotiated by capitalising arrears where customers in arrears have maintained an agreed monthly repayment scheme.
No arrears on unsecured personal loans are capitalised.
Commercial Bank Commercial credit risk management is the responsibility of the Commercial Bank Credit & Risk team, which is independent of the rest of the Commercial Bank up to Executive Director level, and is subject to oversight by Group Risk.
These place limits on the levels of unsecured business and the sector, geography, residual value and seniority of exposures.
The Commercial Bank Credit & Risk team has a level of delegated sanctioning authority and underwrites certain credit risks, with large or higher risk exposures subject to further Group Risk or Credit Committee sanction.
Lending decisions are based on independent credit risk analysis supplemented by the use of internal ratings tools which assess the obligors likelihood of default.
The output of the ratings tools is a borrower grade which maps to a long-run average one year probability of default.
Borrower grades are reviewed at least annually, allowing identification of adverse individual and sector trends.
The grade is integrated into an overall Credit & Risk evaluation, including wider factors such as transaction and borrower structure ranking and structural subordination, debt serviceability and security initial and residual value considerations.
Consideration is also given to risk mitigation measures to protect the Group, such as third-party guarantees, supporting collateral and security, robust legal documentation, financial covenants and hedging.
Transactions are further assessed using an internal pricing model which measures both the return on equity and the risk adjusted return on capital against a series of benchmarks to ensure risks are appropriately priced.
Portfolio asset quality monitoring is based on a number of measures, including expected loss, financial covenant monitoring, security revaluations, pricing movements and external input from rating agencies and other organisations.
Should particular exposures begin to show adverse features such as payment arrears, covenant breaches or business trading performance that is materially worse than expected at the point of lending, a full risk reappraisal is undertaken.
Where appropriate, case management is transferred to a specialist recovery team that works with the customer in an attempt to resolve the situation.
If this does not prove possible, cases are classified as being unsatisfactory and are subject to intensive monitoring and management procedures designed to maximise debt recovery.

co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 60 2 Risk management policy and control framework continued The commercial lending portfolio is subject to regular monitoring for potential impairment.
This monitoring includes review of each counterpartys repayment record and examination of new financial and business sector information relevant to each counterparty.
In the event of deterioration in a counterpartys creditworthiness being identified through this monitoring a thorough analysis is undertaken to establish the full circumstances surrounding the cause and severity of that deterioration.
Where this indicates a reasonable expectation that future anticipated cashflows may not be received, the asset originating these doubtful cashflows is deemed to be impaired.
Typical reasons for an impairment charge being made include counterparty insolvency, failure to make agreed repayments or a breach of a covenant included within facility documentation.
5.1m 2006: 2.8m of loans that would have been past due or impaired, have had their terms renegotiated.
Treasury Group Risk is responsible for the credit control of assets held by Treasury, as well as for all country, sovereign and financial institution exposures.
Group Risk is independent of the Treasury business unit up to Board level.
Risks are managed in accordance with limits, asset quality plans and criteria set out in the relevant policy statement which is approved by GRC.
The policy sets out devolved powers which require higher levels of authorisation according to the size or risks of transactions.
Lending and investment decisions are based on independent credit risk analysis, supplemented by the output of internal ratings tools and external rating agency analysis.
An internal ratings model is used to grade financial institution exposures and to generate probability of default and expected loss.
The Group uses external ratings supplemented by internal analysis to assess the risks associated with structured credit and securitisation investments.
Individual exposures are reviewed at least annually.
Treasury uses a number of risk mitigation techniques including guarantees, netting and collateralisation agreements.
Asset quality monitoring is reported by regular executive and management reporting, quarterly reporting to the GRC and exception reporting against a range of asset quality triggers, which include expected loss analysis.

Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 61 The treasury investment portfolio is monitored for potential impairment as soon as an event occurs to suggest a counterpartys creditworthiness merits attention.
Once specific events give rise to a reasonable expectation that future anticipated cashflows may not be received, the asset originating these doubtful cashflows will be deemed to be impaired.
For structured investment vehicles SIVs, impairment is deemed to have occurred when one or more of the following events have occurred: the vehicle has realised losses arising from sale of assets that make it probable that the note-holders will not receive principal and base coupon in full: the vehicle has been restructured and the terms of the restructuring make it probable that the note-holders will not receive principal and base coupon in full: the Group expects to participate in a restructuring or refinancing of the vehicle which has been proposed by the vehicles manager or sponsor and the likely terms make it probable that the note-holders will not receive principal and base coupon in full: the vehicle has entered into enforcement: or the funding and market conditions are such that the vehicle is expected either to sell assets or restructure such that it is probable that the note-holders will not receive principal and base coupon in full.
Collateralised debt obligations CDOs containing sub-prime US mortgage assets are deemed impaired if estimated losses on the underlying assets exceed the level of credit support.
The key assumptions are: US house prices are assumed to fall, peak to trough by 25%: the cost of repossession is assumed to be 15%: We continue to have a high quality trading and investment securities portfolio with 94% 2006: 95% of securities rated at A or above.

The Groups exposure to market risk is governed by a policy approved by ALCO and ratified by GRC.
The policy sets out the nature of risk which may be taken, and applicable maximum risk limits.
The Group risk limits are allocated by ALCO to all Group business units.
Group Risk monitors compliance with market risk limits and reports excesses to ALCO.
Interest rate risk Interest rate re-pricing risk mainly arises from mismatches between the re-pricing dates of the assets and liabilities on the Groups balance sheet, changes in the value of non-linear interest rate positions such as interest rate caps, and from the investment of the Groups reserves and non-interest and low interest rate liabilities.
The Group has established a transfer pricing system which passes interest rate re-pricing risks that arise in the various Group businesses to Treasury.
Treasury manages the Groups overall interest rate risk within policy limits.
In addition, strategic hedges are agreed by the ALCO for the investment of the Groups reserves and non interest and low interest rate liabilities.
These hedges are transacted by Treasury.
co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 62 2 Risk management policy and control framework continued Interest rate risk limits are expressed as the maximum principal amount which is re-priced during a given time period.
In the case of Treasury, interest rate risk is measured and limited according to the market value impact of a one basis point shift in particular points on the yield curve.
In addition, Value at Risk VaR is used to measure the Groups total exposure to interest rate risks and to generate an economic capital estimate for interest rate risk.
The VaR measurement methodology calculates the maximum amount likely to be lost, in market value terms, from existing risk positions as a result of movement in market interest rates.
The Group uses a variance-covariance VaR model based on historical volatility and correlation data and measures VaR to 95% confidence over a one month holding period.
A separate model is used to calculate the VaR on positions, such as interest rate options, whose market value varies with changes in interest rates in a non-linear way.
Although it is a useful tool in measuring risk, VaR does contain some limitations.
It does not accurately measure extreme events.
The use of a 95% confidence level does not by definition include losses beyond this level of confidence.
It relies on the historical volatility and correlation data being similar to the volatility and correlation positions going forward.
The VaR of the Groups non-trading book exposures are shown below: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Value at Risk 5.4 2.5 5.2 2.4 The above analysis excludes strategic hedges of Group reserves, non-interest and low interest rate liabilities.
Interest rate exposures arising from basis risk, prepayment risk and pipeline risk are excluded from the above measure.
These risks are measured using separate techniques and are regularly reported to the ALCO.
The Groups trading activities are conducted through the Groups Treasury division.
Group Treasurys control of, and approach to, market risk, with respect to its trading book activities, is defined by market risk tolerance levels documented in a policy approved by GRC.
Market Risk in the trading book is measured and controlled through stop loss limits and interest rate and credit spread sensitivity limits.
For Foreign Exchange positions, net present values of net short positions and stop losses are monitored.

Monitoring of the sensitivity to 1bp change in credit spread commenced in 2007.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups policy is to have no material open foreign currency positions.
The Group offers foreign exchange services to customers through both Treasury and Commercial Bank operations.
Detailed limits and controls are established within those businesses to control the exposure.
Commercial Bank clears its positions with Treasury in accordance with the policy of transferring market risk positions to Treasury wherever possible.
As part of its normal operations, Treasury borrows and invests funds in currencies other than sterling.
The foreign exchange risks of these activities are hedged within Treasurys limits.
Equity risk The Groups policy is to have no material exposure to equity price risk.
Retail Banking sells third party stock market bonds.
The equity and interest rate risks from these bonds are borne entirely by the third party.
Alliance & Leicester International Limited sells stock market bonds to customers.
Positions may arise in the management of such bonds due to mismatches between the hedging contracts and the underlying customer liabilities.
Procedures are established to minimise these positions as tightly as is operationally practicable and to report open positions to ALCO on a monthly basis.
Inflation risk The Groups policy is to have no material exposure to inflation risk.
This risk arises due to the exposure to inflation linked bonds and loans in Commercial Banking.
It is the Groups policy to fully hedge inflation risk, using inflation swaps or other effective hedge instruments.
iv Liquidity and funding risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due, or that the Group is unable to meet regulatory prudential liquidity ratios.
It is Group policy to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are at all times available to meet the Groups obligations, after taking into account withdrawals of customer deposits, draw-down of customer facilities and growth in the balance sheet.
The management of the Groups liquidity is the responsibility of Treasury, which provides funding to and takes surplus funds from each of the Groups businesses as required, and also holds liquid assets and committed facilities to cover any liquidity shortfall.
Daily monitoring of liquidity limits is performed by Group Risk.
Liquidity policy is approved by ALCO and ratified by GRC.
The policy requires compliance with Sterling Stock Liquidity rules and places limits on maximum wholesale outflow over particular time horizons, and specifies minimum holdings of eligible liquid assets and committed facilities.
The policy also specifies the minimum amount of wholesale funding over one year, and specifies the maximum ratio of customer loans and advances to the sum of wholesale funding with a residual maturity in excess of one year and customer deposits.
The Group performs liquidity stress testing based on a range of adverse scenarios, and has a liquidity contingency funding plan which is maintained in order to ensure that the Group has access to sufficient resources to meet obligations as they fall due if these scenarios occur.
Stressed liquidity profiles are reported to ALCO quarterly.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 63 Our assets are funded using a well diversified mix of retail and wholesale funds.
We plan to fund our customer loans and advances using customer deposits and wholesale funds with a maturity duration of at least six months see page 12 for further detail.
The Group manages liquidity risk based on scenarios around expected, as opposed to contractual, maturity profiles.
Managing liquidity on an expected maturity basis recognises that some liabilities are likely to be paid later than the earliest date the Group is contractually required to pay.
For instance, although a customer placing a deposit with the Group may be contractually able to withdraw the deposit at any time, resulting in this deposit being recorded in the Less than 1 Month bucket in the tables below, this is not an accurate representation of how long the deposit is expected to remain with the Group.
The tables below analyse the Groups and Companys non-derivative liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date.
Amounts represent undiscounted cashflows of financial liabilities including interest.
The tables are based on contractual rather than expected maturities and include interest payments.
Where the Group or Company has a right or obligation to repay a facility, the facility is recognised at the earliest contractual cashflow date rather than maturity.
These figures reflect the contractual maturities on securitisation to 2031 and 2054.
The following tables give the Companys and the Groups contractual maturities for their derivative financial instruments.
The tables have been drawn up based on undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instruments settled on a net basis, and the undiscounted gross inflows outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amounts disclosed have been determined by reference to the projected interest rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.

The tables below analyse the Group and Company assets and liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to contractual maturity at the balance sheet date.
Derivatives are an efficient and cost effective means of managing risk and are an essential tool in treasury management.
Derivatives are used primarily by the Group for balance sheet management purposes.
Types of derivatives and uses The principal derivatives used in balance sheet risk management are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements FRAs, futures, interest rate options and foreign exchange contracts, which are used to hedge balance sheet exposures arising from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, personal and commercial loans, leasing arrangements, fixed rate savings products, funding and investment activities and foreign exchange services to customers.

The estimated fair value of other loans and deposits is based on discounted cash flows using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and remaining maturity.
Loans and advances to customers and due to customers Floating rate loans and advances and deposits are recorded in the balance sheet using the Effective Interest Rate EIR method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered to be a good approximation for fair value.
For fixed rate loans and advances and deposits the fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on the instruments at current market interest rates.
Net investment in finance leases and hire purchase contracts The fair value of floating rate assets is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The estimated fair value of fixed rate assets is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on the instruments at current market interest rates.
Investment securities, debt securities in issue, and other borrowed funds Fair values are based on quoted market prices.
For instruments where quoted market prices are not available, the market price is based on discounted cash flows using interest rates for securities with similar credit, maturity and yield characteristics.
Held-to-maturity investment securities comprise mezzanine and capital notes in Structured Investment Vehicles SIVs.
The fair value of these investments has been estimated by considering their net asset value, which is the share of the market value of assets minus liabilities.
For mezzanine notes the net asset value is 100% of the par value of the notes, provided the net asset value of the junior notes is above zero.
For the purpose of this table, operating lease assets have been included within Non financial assets and not commercial assets.
co. uk Statutory Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 70 2 Risk management policy and control framework continued vii Capital management In order to protect the solvency of the Group, internal capital is held to provide a cushion for unexpected losses.
In assessing the adequacy of its capital, the Group considers its risk appetite, the material risks to which the Group is exposed and the appropriate management strategies for each of the Groups material risks, including whether or not capital provides an appropriate mitigant.
In addition to capital adequacy reporting to the FSA, a FICAA Full Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment is performed semi-annually, in order to assess the Groups capital adequacy and to determine the levels of capital required going forward to support the current and future risks in the business.
All parts of this analysis are pulled together into a single document, the executive summary of which is approved by the GRC.
Finance is responsible for producing budgets to identify expected future capital requirements from changes to business volumes and mix of assets and activities.
Group Risk is responsible for ensuring that the Groups current and future risks are reflected in the capital adequacy assessment and that sufficient capital is maintained to provide the Group with adequate headroom given multiple stressed scenarios.
The amount and composition of the Groups capital requirement is determined by assessing the minimum capital requirement under Pillar 1 based upon the Capital Requirements Directive CRD, the Groups economic capital requirement, the impact of stress and scenario tests, the Groups Individual Capital Guidance and the capital requirement that is consistent with the Groups target external rating.
The table below summarises the composition of regulatory capital for the Group as at 1 January and 31 December 2007.
During the years ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007, the individual entities within the Group and the Group complied with all of the externally imposed capital requirements to which they are subject.
In 2007 capital was managed under a Basel II basis 2006: Basel I basis.

Retained earnings and other reserves exclude gains or losses on cashflow hedges and available-for-sale assets.
The regulatory capital rules allow the pension scheme deficit to be added back to regulatory capital and a deduction taken for an estimate of the additional contributions to be made in the next five years, less associated deferred tax.
When the Scheme is in surplus, the pension fund asset is not included within capital.
This adjustment is reflected in the reserves number.
See Note 36 for further information.
See Note 35 for further information.
Intangible assets include capitalised software and goodwill.
Under Basel II a deduction is made for the excess of expected losses over customer loans and advances provisions that are on an IRB approach.
Half of this is deducted from tier 1 capital and half from tier 2 capital.
The subordinated debt was raised in order to increase the capital base of the company.
In accordance with FSA guidance, in the last five years to maturity the subordinated debt is amortised on a straight line basis.
See Note 32 for further information.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 71 In 2007 the Group bought back 19.9m shares at a total cost of 194m.
Our total capital resources benefitted by 52m as a result of lower deductions for expected losses, following further refinement of our Basel II models.
Total capital resources were reduced by 61m as a result of an increase in intangible assets, reflecting the ongoing investment in the ALNOVA system.
Risk weighted assets The table below shows the Groups risk weighted assets RWA and operational risk under Basel II Pillar 1, and the Basel I RWA.

The definition Investments in securitisations includes ABS, MBS, SIVs, CDOs and liquidity facilities.
Includes market risk, current accounts, exposures to Central Banks and other assets.
Notional risk weighted assets calculated at the end of each financial year.
As a result of Basel II, the Groups RWA at 31 December 2007 were 35% lower than they would have been under Basel I, reflecting our high quality assets and risk management processes.
The Groups RWA under Basel II increased by 3.8bn in 2007.
Mortgage RWA reduced by 0.6bn, reflecting the refinement of our Basel II mortgage models, whilst corporates, which primarily reflects commercial lending, increased by 2.1bn, predominantly reflecting the growth in balances and a small reduction in the proportion of bank guaranteed loans.
RWA relating to banks, including FRNs, increased as a result of the higher levels of liquidity being held.
RWA relating to the category securitisations, including ABS, CDOs and CLOs, increased by 1.8bn, reflecting the restructuring of SIVs and reductions in their credit ratings.
Our total RWA also includes 59m of RWA in respect of our off-balance sheet conduit.

Our internal assessment of the Pillar 2 capital requirement is currently around 30% of the Groups Pillar 1 requirement, prior to any additional FSA capital guidance.
Together, these make up our total Basel II capital requirement.
During the transition to Basel II, the Group is required to hold capital at or above a transitional floor.
This floor is calculated as 8% of Basel I RWA, less collective provisions, multiplied by a factor of 95% in 2007, 90% in 2008 and 80% in 2009.
The Groups total capital resources at the end of 2007 were higher than our Basel II capital requirement and the transitional floor.
Under Basel II Pillar 3, the Group is required to disclose additional information on its loans and advances.
These disclosures will provide more detail of our high quality assets, and will be published on the Groups website in April.

The tax provision release in 2006 is in respect of the excess received from the disposal of the credit card accounts to MBNA in August 2002.
The Company maintains sufficient reserves to maintain its ongoing business activities.
Regulatory capital is monitored at a Group level and there are no specific externally imposed capital requirements for the Company.
3 Critical accounting estimates and areas of significant management judgement Some asset and liability amounts reported in the accounts are based on management judgements, estimates and assumptions.
There is therefore a risk of significant changes to the carrying amounts for these assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment provisions Retail Banking and Commercial Bank The level of potential credit losses is uncertain and depends on a number of factors such as unemployment levels, interest rates, house price levels, commercial property prices and other general economic conditions.
The Group bases impairment provisions on estimates based on historical loss experience.
Actual cash flows on financial assets may differ from management judgements and estimates, resulting in an increase or decrease in impairment charges and provisions.
These models used in calculating the impairment provisions do not contain judgemental inputs, but judgement and knowledge are needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
Retail Banking use different provisioning models for unsecured personal loans, to those used for mortgage and current accounts.
During the year the unsecured personal loan model was refined.
To the extent that actual losses incurred differ from that estimated by -10%, the impairment provisions on loans and advances to customers would change by an estimated 12.0m 2006: 13.5m higher or 12.0m 2006: 13.4m lower respectively.
Impairment provisions Treasury An impairment charge of 152.9m was made in 2007 2006: nil against the Groups treasury instruments, comprising 142.3m for Structured Investment Vehicles SIVs and 10.6m for Collateralised Debt Obligations CDOs.
SIVs The impairment loss charge for SIVs is made up of 31.2m realised losses on restructured SIVs and a provision of 111.1m against the Groups gross exposure to SIVs at 31 December 2007 of 324.0m.
The provision is based on an estimate of losses that the SIVs have incurred which is described in Note 2 on page 60 and 61.
If the provision was restricted to losses on assets already sold at the balance sheet date then it would decrease by 73.4m to 37.7m and the 2007 SIV impairment loss charge would fall to 68.9m.
If the provision was increased to reduce the carrying value of the SIVs not being restructured to net asset value then it would increase by 32.1m to 143.2m, and the 2007 SIV impairment loss charge would increase to 174.4m.
CDOs At 31 December 2007 the Group had 117.1m of CDOs held on our balance sheet, with 53.6m of these having some sub prime exposure.
Any impairment on these assets was reflected in the Income Statement as part of dealing losses.
Changes in fair value in available-for-sale AFS assets were recognised directly in the AFS reserve, except for 10.6m losses on impaired assets which were recognised in the Income Statement.
CDOs were assessed for impairment by considering the quality and vintage of the underlying assets and the level of credit support.
Certain assumptions were made with regard to US house prices, arrears levels and losses on defaults.
Impairment was calculated using an assumption of a 25% peak to trough fall in US house prices and an average repossession cost of 15%.
If a more pessimistic scenario was assumed, including a 40% fall in US house prices and an average repossession cost of 25%, then the impairment loss charge would increase to 25.9m.
In addition, the Group has an off balance sheet conduit.
None of these assets were considered to be impaired.
In a more pessimistic scenario an impairment charge of 5.9m would be required against the Groups loan facility to the conduit.
Effective interest rate calculations IAS 39 requires certain financial assets and liabilities to be held at amortised cost, with income recognised using the EIR methodology.
In order to calculate EIR, it is necessary to estimate the level of repayments that will be made before the contractual due date.
For residential mortgages the estimated level and timing of redemptions is critical to the EIR calculation.
If customers redeem their product earlier than anticipated, this will generally lead to a reduction in the balance sheet carrying value, and a corresponding charge to the Income Statement.
If our view of expected average product lives was to fall by one month, consistently across all product categories, this would lead to a fall in the carrying value of mortgage balances of 11.1m 2006: 15.6m.
Conversely an increase in expected average product lives of one month would lead to an increase in the carrying value of mortgage balances of 11.0m 2006: 15.5m.
Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 73 Retirement benefit obligations The Income Statement cost and the balance sheet asset liability of the defined benefit pension scheme and post-retirement medical benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
Assumptions are made for inflation, the rate of increase in salaries and pensions, the rate used to discount scheme liabilities, the expected return on scheme assets and mortality rates.
Changes to any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the balance sheet assets liabilities, and to a lesser extent the Income Statement costs.
Further information is available in Note 33.
Valuation of financial instruments The values of financial instruments that are classified at fair value through profit or loss including those held for trading purposes, available-for-sale, and all derivatives are stated at fair value.
The vast majority of fair values are quoted market prices or prices obtained from counterparties.
The fair value of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined in reference to quoted market prices.
The fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are calculated on a discounted cashflow basis by reference to current yield curves.
4 Operating segments The Group adopted IFRS 8 Operating Segments in advance of its effective date, with effect from 1 January 2007.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports and components of the Group regularly reviewed by the Group Chief Executive to allocate resources to segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor standard IAS 14 Segmental reporting defined the way in which the results of the segments were presented, which was not aligned with internal reporting.
As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the analysis of the Groups reportable segments has changed, and the prior year amounts have been restated.
The Group is managed as follows, in segments determined according to similar economic characteristics and customer base.
Retail Banking This comprises the Core 4 products of current accounts, mortgages, personal loans and savings, plus the Partner 4 products of long term investments, life assurance, general insurance and credit cards.
Commercial Banking This comprises Commercial Bank, consisting of the core business lines of lending, business banking and money transmission, and Treasury.
Group Items This represents corporate overheads and income not allocated to business units.
Transactions between the segments are on normal commercial terms and conditions, but are excluded for internal reporting.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies, as described in Note 1.
No geographical analysis is presented because substantially all of the Groups activities are in the UK.
A more detailed breakdown of segment core operating profit is given within the unaudited Financial Review on pages 14 to 20.
Further information on segment assets is provided in Note 2 pages 54 to 72.
The majority of revenue for the Group is derived from interest.
Net interest income is used to assess the performance of each segment.
Therefore interest income is presented net of interest expense.

6 Hedge ineffectiveness The hedge ineffectiveness loss of 9.5m 2006: 7.6m gain represents the net fair value loss on derivative instruments that are matching risk exposure on an economic basis.
Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The loss is primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.

The calculation of the 2007 underlying effective tax rate excludes the tax credit of 2.9m in respect of the 9.5m hedge ineffectiveness loss, the tax credit of 2.5m in respect of the 8.4m of redundancy costs primarily relating to the re-organisation of the Groups current accounts back office operations, and takes into consideration, in calculating underlying profits, the appropriation of profit of 17.5m in respect of our innovative tier 1 capital securities.
The 2006 underlying effective tax rate excludes the release of a 29.7m tax provision.
It further excludes a tax charge of 2.3m in respect of the 7.6m hedge ineffectiveness gain, a tax credit of 7.3m in respect of the 24.2m of redundancy costs, and takes into consideration, in calculating underlying profits, the appropriation of profit of 17.5m in respect of our innovative tier 1 capital securities.
During 2007 the Government enacted a change in corporation tax reducing the rate from 30% to 28% with effect from April 2008.
The impact of this change on the corporation tax charge is disclosed in the table below.
Further information about deferred tax is presented in Note 31 on page 91.
The effective rate of tax for the year of 25.9% is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30%, where the Group generates substantially all its profits.

The Notes are serviceable firstly from cash flows generated by the mortgage assets and thereafter from the proceeds of the subordinated loans.
The Company receives the excess spread on the transactions as deferred consideration, after the SPVs have met their liabilities.
The Groups maximum exposure including subordinated loans to the credit risk of securitised mortgages is 14,041.9m 2006: 957.2m.
This credit risk exposure relates to the subordinated loans, Notes purchased and retained by the Group and the risks retained upon the transfer of Notes to investors outside the Group.

The fair value option is used by the Group where Treasury assets or liabilities would otherwise be measured at amortised cost, the associated derivatives used to economically hedge the risk are held at fair value, and it is not practical to apply hedge accounting.
The Group has also designated certain financial instruments containing embedded derivatives at fair value through profit or loss.
The table below shows the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities that upon initial recognition, or at 1 January 2005 on the adoption of IAS 39, were designated at fair value through profit or loss, and the net gains or losses on these instruments.

New employees joining the Group on or after 1 April 1998 were eligible to join a defined contribution section of the Scheme.
The principal scheme is a registered approved pension scheme under which retirement and death benefits are provided for Group employees.
The funds of the Scheme are administered by trustees independently of the finances of the participating employers.
In addition, benefits are provided by the Company on an unfunded unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989, whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
The Group has adopted the revised IAS 19, published in December 2004.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in full, through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2007.
Scheme liabilities are based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2006 and updated by an independent qualified actuary to assess the liabilities as at 31 December 2007.
Alliance & Leicester plc is the sponsoring employer for the Scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for recharging the defined benefit cost to other companies in the Group.
Therefore, in accordance with IAS 19, the Company recognises the whole defined benefit liability of the Scheme.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Group 2007 2006 m m Present value of funded obligations 1,323.8 1,327.3 Fair value of Scheme assets 1,376.6 1,310.5 52.8 16.8 Present value of unfunded obligations 10.8 9.5 Alliance & Leicester Annual Report and Accounts 2007 93 The surplus of 52.8m in the funded Scheme reflects current market conditions and could be eliminated in the event of decreases in asset values or changes to liability assumptions.

3.80% 3.50% Pensions rate of increase p. a.
3.30% 3.00% Discount rate used to determine net pension cost 5.20% 4.90% 1 Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at 31 December: pensioners 5.90% 5.20% 1 Discount rate used to determine benefit obligations at 31 December: non-pensioners 5.60% 5.20% Expected return on Scheme equities 7.75% 7.50% Expected return on Scheme bonds 4.95% 4.50% Expected return on Scheme properties 6.20% n a Note: 1.
In 2006 a single combined discount rate of 5.20% was used for pensioners and non-pensioners.

Litigation On 27 July 2007 it was announced that the Office of Fair Trading had agreed with seven UK Banks and one Building Society to start proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales in a test case to determine the legal status and enforceability of certain charges relating to unauthorised overdrafts.
Alliance & Leicester is not part of the proceedings but will be bound by the outcome.
During the test case proceedings the Financial Ombudsman Service has agreed to suspend reviews of all personal customer current account fee complaints, and the majority of county courts have agreed to stay pending any potential future litigation in relation to such matters.
In addition, the Financial Services Authority has granted banks a waiver from processing complaints received from customers in respect of current account overdraft charges.
Until the outcome of the test case is finally determined it is not possible to conclude whether the charges are fair and enforceable or otherwise.
On this basis, no provision for any claims that may arise has been made in these accounts.
Whilst the legal proceedings continue, and given the numerous uncertainties regarding the case, there are a range of possible outcomes that could be finally determined.
These would cover the period over which reimbursement would be required and the level of reimbursement.
Therefore, it is not practicable, at this stage, to reliably estimate the financial impact on the Group if the court rules against the Banks and Building Society.
