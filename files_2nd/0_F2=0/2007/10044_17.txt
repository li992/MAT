These risks are managed by a centralised treasury department, in accordance with Board approved objectives, policies and authorities.
Regular reports monitor exposures and assist in managing the associated risks.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is subject to foreign exchange risks on future commercial transactions and net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The principal exposures arise with respect to the US dollar against the Pound sterling.
To mitigate risks associated with future commercial transactions the Group policy is to hedge known, and certain forecast transaction exposures based on historical experience and projections.
The Group hedges at least 70% of the next 12 months anticipated exposure and can hedge up to five years ahead.
The Group uses borrowings denominated in the relevant currencies to hedge its investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Credit risk The Group is not subject to significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread across a large number of companies across the world.
In addition, many of the Groups principal customers are either government departments or large multinationals.
Policies are maintained to ensure the Group makes sales to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Letters of credit or other appropriate instruments are put in place to reduce credit risk where considered necessary.
The Group is also subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its other financial instruments which it controls through only dealing with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement wherever possible.
Interest rate risk The Group has borrowings issued at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk whereas floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is to maintain at least 25% of its net debt at fixed rates.
The Group mitigates interest rate risks through swaps which have the economic effect of converting fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings and floating rate borrowings into fixed rate borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group maintains sufficient committed facilities to meet projected borrowing requirements based on cash flow forecasts.
Additional headroom is maintained to protect against the variability of cash flows and to accommodate small bolt-on acquisitions.
Key ratios are monitored to ensure continued compliance with covenants contained in the Groups principal credit agreements.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date.

The table below illustrates the sensitivity of the Groups results to changes in these key variables as at the balance sheet date.
The analysis covers only financial assets and liabilities held at the balance sheet date and is made on the basis of the hedge designations in place on the relative dates and assuming no hedge ineffectiveness.

However, as all US dollar debt is designated as a net investment hedge, the impact is entirely offset by the retranslation of overseas operations.
Capital risk management The Groups objective when managing its capital structure is to minimise the cost of capital while maintaining adequate capital to protect against volatility in earnings and net asset values.
The strategy is designed to maximise shareholder return over the long term.
The relative proportion of debt to equity will be adjusted over the medium term depending on the cost of debt compared to equity and the level of uncertainty facing the industry and the Group.
The capital structure of the Group at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2007 2006 Restated m m Obligations under finance leases current 0.5 Bank and other borrowings current 16.7 17.3 Obligations under finance leases non-current 5.0 Bank and other borrowings non-current 858.1 380.0 Less cash and cash equivalents 64.9 43.6 Total net debt 815.4 353.7 Total equity 1,063.4 559.4 Debt equity % 77% 63% 4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies set out in note 2 management is required to make certain estimates and judgements concerning the future.
These estimates and judgements are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary.
The estimates and judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts included in these consolidated financial statements are as follows: Income taxes In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Retirement benefit obligations The liability recognised in respect of retirement benefit obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including those relating to mortality, inflation, salary increases, healthcare cost increases and the rate at which liabilities are discounted.
Any change in these assumptions would impact the retirement benefit obligations recognised.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 35.
Goodwill Each year the Group carries out impairment tests of its goodwill balances which requires estimates to be made of the value in use of its cash generating units CGUs.
These value in use calculations are dependent on estimates of the future cash flows and long-term growth rates of the CGUs.
Further details on these estimates are provided in note 19.
Development costs and programme participation costs The Group capitalises development costs and programme participation costs provided they meet certain criteria as set out in note 2.
Costs are only capitalised where management are satisfied as to the ultimate commercial viability of the project based on available information.
Projects typically involve long-term relationships on aircraft platforms and in assessing commercial viability, estimates need to be made of future revenues which are dependent on a number of factors including the size, utilisation and life of the aircraft fleet to which the capitalised costs relate.

Advice is received by the Group from its environmental consultants and legal advisors to assist in the determination of the timing and an estimate of the costs that the Group may incur in respect of such claims and an appropriate provision is made.
To the extent that these estimates change as more information becomes available, adjustments are made to the carrying value of the provision.
The Group has extensive insurance arrangements in place to mitigate the impact of historical environmental events on the Group.
Legal and regulatory The Group is subject to legal proceedings and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgements or outcomes, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.
A determination of the amount of reserves required for these matters is based on a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel.
However, actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates.
Fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination On the acquisition of a business it is necessary to attribute fair values to any intangible assets acquired provided they meet the criteria to be recognised.
The fair values of these intangible assets are dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, margins and cash flows.

The appointment of auditors to these Group pension schemes and the fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the trustees of each scheme, who act independently from the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditor for audit services to these pension schemes during the year was 27,000 2006: 29,000.
The Group engages  LLP to undertake those non-audit related activities which they are required to, and most suited to, perform.

10 Reconciliations between profit and underlying profit Underlying profit is used by the Board to measure and monitor the underlying trading performance of the Group.
It excludes certain items as shown below: Note 2007 2006 Restated m m Operating profit 142.7 143.2 Exceptional operating costs see note 11 5.4 1.5 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations a 38.4 12.9 Disposal of inventory revalued in business combinations b 21.3 1.3 Financial instruments c 5.3 12.1 Goodwill adjustment arising from recognition of tax losses d 3.2 2.4 Adjustments to operating profit 73.6 6.0 Underlying operating profit 216.3 149.2 Profit before tax 105.4 126.7 Adjustments to operating profit per above 73.6 6.0 Exceptional finance costs see note 11 2.0 Exceptional finance income see note 11 2.0 Adjustments to profit before tax 73.6 6.0 Underlying profit before tax 179.0 132.7 Profit for the year 89.3 94.3 Adjustments to profit before tax per above 73.6 6.0 Tax effect of adjustments to operating profit 33.1 3.4 Underlying profit for the year 129.8 96.9 a.
The Group excludes from its underlying profit figures the amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations.
2007 2006 Restated m m Amortisation of other intangible assets see note 21 41.4 16.0 Less amortisation of purchased intangible assets see note 21 3.0 3.1 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations 38.4 12.9 b. IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired through a business combination to be valued at selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress acquired in a business combination is valued at selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the work not yet completed.
The fair value of acquired inventory is thus significantly higher than the same items built post acquisition, the value of which includes no profit element.
This increase arising from the revalued inventory is charged to the income statement as the inventory is consumed and is excluded from the Groups underlying profit figures.

Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures, it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation required to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not merited.
The Groups underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting had been applied.
Where interest rate derivatives do not qualify to be hedge accounted, movements in the fair value of these derivatives are excluded from underlying profit.
Where interest rate derivatives do qualify to be accounted for as fair value hedges, the difference between the movement in the fair values of the derivatives and in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is excluded from underlying profit.
Any gains or losses arising from the requirement to continue to measure fixed rate borrowings at fair value after the associated interest rate derivatives have matured or have been cancelled are also excluded from underlying profit.
2007 2006 m m Movement in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts see not e 32 5.8 14.0 Impact of retranslating net foreign currency assets and liabilities at spot rate 0.7 2.0 Movement in the fair value of interest rate derivatives 0.2 0.1 Movement in the fair value of associated fixed interest rate borrowings 0.2 Financial instruments loss gain 5.3 12.1 d. The goodwill adjustment arises from the recognition of tax losses during the year in respect of businesses acquired in earlier years.
These tax losses existed when the businesses were acquired but a deferred tax asset was not recognised at the time as the recoverability of those losses was not probable at the time the fair values were finalised.
IFRS requires that goodwill is adjusted in the year the recoverability becomes probable with a corresponding charge recorded in profit before tax.

Cos ts incurred to date arise from eliminating K & F head office costs, combining our UK brakes maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities in the UK onto Dunlops Coventry site, as well as the creation of a single brakes sales and marketing organisation and detailed planning of the remaining integration activities.
Further exceptional operating costs of 24.3 million are expected to arise over the next 3 years as the integration is completed.
During the year the consolidation of FATS UK onto the Meggitt Defence Systems Limited site in Kent has been completed.
In the US, Caswell is in the process of being consolidated with FATS US at a new site in Atlanta.
The consolidation will be completed in the first half of 2008.
Cash expenditure on all exceptional operating costs was 4.2 million 2006: 1.8 million.
The tax credit in respect of the exceptional operating costs was 1.7 million 2006: 0.5 million.
c. The Group announced on 6 March 2007 the proposed acquisition of K & F for an enterprise value of USD 1.8 billion funded in part by a rights issue with the balance financed by a new debt facility.
The reduction in net finance costs arising from the cash raised by the rights issue and finance costs associated with the new debt facilities have been treated as exceptional net finance income in respect of the period between the completion of the rights issue on 18 April 2007 and the completion of the acquisition on 22 June 2007. d. Following the acquisition of K & F, the Group commenced a cash tender offer for K & Fs USD 315 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% senior subordinated notes which were due in 2014.
This tender offer successfully completed on 3 August 2007.
The premium payable on redemption, being the difference between the total consideration paid and the book value of the notes at the date the offer completed, has been treated as exceptional finance costs.

These have been recognised in the balance sheet on acquisition to the extent that they were expected to be realised based on information at the acquisition date.
The Group has subsequently been able to use tax losses and other assets to a greater extent than anticipated on acquisition.
In those cases the value of goodwill is reduced.
In order to comply with the requirements of IAS12 Income Taxes, a charge is reported in operating expenses as shown in note 10 whilst a deferred tax credit is made.
The Group continues to make use of tax losses and other reliefs wherever possible in order to reduce the level of payments to the tax authorities, not withstanding the adverse impact on reported profits before tax.
The sensitivity of the tax charge to changes in the tax rate is such that a one percentage point increase or reduction in the tax rate would cause the total taxation charge for 2007 to increase or reduce respectively by approximately 1 million.
15 Profit of parent company The consolidated profit attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a profit, after dividends received, of 40.8 million 2006: 16.8 million which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC, which prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP, has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 allowing it not to publish a separate profit and loss account.
16 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes any shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 39.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options in issue are exercised.

For the purposes of underlying EPS for 2007 the Group has also adjusted the weighted average number of shares used to exclude the effect of the new shares for this same period.
The weighted average number of shares used for underlying EPS in 2007 is 586.9 million.

For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
No impairment charge was required in the year 2006: Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was Nil 2006: Nil.
The key assumptions used in the impairment calculations were: The forecast operating cash flows for the next three years based on approved budgets and plans.
These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU: An estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU: An estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term estimate for the business in which the CGU operates: An estimate of the terminal value of the business using the Gordon Growth model.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a post tax discount rate of 7.4% 2006: 8.0%.
Sensitivity analysis as at 31 December 2007 has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable change in the key assumptions used in the impairment model would result in a significant impairment charge being recorded in the financial statements.

31 Financial instruments For cash, receivables and short-term borrowings the fair value of the financial instruments approximates to their book value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
On receivables, allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.
For medium and long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities, the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

The Groups operations and facilities are subject to a number of laws and regulations that govern the discharge of pollutants and hazardous substances into air and water, the handling, storage and disposal of such materials and other environmental matters.
Currently the Group is involved in the investigation and remediation of certain sites for which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under US environmental laws.
The Group has made provision for the expected costs arising from these sites based on information currently available and established a receivable to the extent these costs are recoverable under the Groups environmental insurance policies.
A number of asbestos related claims are received each year by subsidiary companies.
To date the total amount concerned for such claims in any year has not been material and many claims are covered fully or partly by existing insurance or indemnities.
There is a provision for claims which cannot be recovered from insurers.
In 2004 the US Department of Commerce and the US Department of Justice commenced an investigation into the alleged violation of US export control regulations by a US subsidiary of the Group.
In addition the US Department of State is investigating alleged breaches of US re-export regulations by a UK subsidiary of the Group.
These investigations are likely to lead to the payment of financial penalties for which a provision has been made.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next ten years and are discounted, where appropriate, using a discount rate relevant to each provision.
b Onerous contracts include lease obligations and trading contracts.
Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to ten years and are discounted using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
Provision has also been set up for the estimated losses to be made under certain trading contracts.
These are expected to be utilised over the next six years.

The majority relate to the Groups operations in the USA and unutilised losses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the businesses.
The aggregate unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of such unremitted earnings is 21.0 million 2006: 7.9 million.
35 Retirement benefit obligations Pension schemes In the UK, the Group operates four defined benefit schemes, one of which arose on the acquisition of K & F. The assets of the schemes are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
In the USA, the Group operates five defined benefit schemes, three of which arose on the acquisition of K & F. The schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
In Switzerland the Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is a funded scheme.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
Healthcare schemes The Group has two principal other post-retirement benefit schemes providing medical and life assurance benefits, both of which arose on the acquisition of K & F. These schemes are unfunded.

The scheme has many of the characteristics of a defined contribution scheme, however, unlike defined contribution schemes, the minimum interest rate at which employees savings accounts under the plan are required to be remunerated is guaranteed by law.
During the year the Swiss Auditing Chambers Auditing Practice Committee and its Accounting Practice Sub-committee concluded that such schemes should be accounted for as defined benefit schemes under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
Prior year figures for scheme assets and liabilities have been restated accordingly.
The scheme had a small surplus at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 which have not been recognised.
Of the total deficit of 97.2 million, 2.2 million is in respect of unfunded schemes.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the Group considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the scheme populations.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 medium cohort year of birth mortality tables for the UK schemes and the RP2000 IRS RPA @ 2008 tables for the US schemes.

Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain of the management companies.
The fair value of these guarantees is not considered to be significant.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.

Goodwill on acquisition is based upon a provisional allocation of fair values.
These fair values, including the identification and measurement of intangible assets arising on the acquisitions will be finalised during 2008.
The acquisition of K & F is considered significant.
Since acquisition, K & F has contributed 133.9 million to Group revenue, 23.3 million to underlying profit for the year as defined in note 10 and a loss for the year of 3.7 million.
Had K & F been part of the Group for the whole of 2007, it would have contributed revenue of 237.0 million, 38.8 million to underlying profit for the year as defined in note 10 and 10.2 million to profit for the year.
Annualised figures exclude acquisition costs expensed by K & F prior to acquisition by the Group and have been restated using the Groups accounting policies.
Analysis of the net outflow of cash in respect of the acquisition of K & F: 2007 m Cash consideration 551.7 Directly attributable costs 11.9 563.6 Less net cash acquired with subsidiary undertakings 11.5 Net outflow of cash and cash equivalents for acquisitions 552.1 Acquisitions made in 2006 amendment of provisional fair values The Group acquired the business and assets of Radatec, Inc, in August 2006, acquired Keith Products LLP in September 2006 and acquired Firearms Training Systems, Inc. in October 2006.
At 31 December 2006 the Group had allocated provisional fair values to the net assets acquired as a result of these acquisitions.
The Group finalised these fair values in 2007.
In accordance with IFRS 3 these amendments have been recorded as though they were made in 2006.
The amendments made primarily related to the recognition, separately from goodwill, of other intangibles that met the definition of intangible assets and whose fair values could be measured reliably and the revaluation of inventory to fair value.
The recognition of these assets produced a consequent reduction in the goodwill previously reported.
The assets identified were then amortised or charged to the income statement in 2006 as appropriate.
The impact on net assets and the income statement arising from the finalisation of fair values is shown in note 45.

All fair value adjustments are required to be recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and consequently result in the restatement of previously reported financial results.
During 2007 the Group finalised the fair values of three acquisitions completed in 2006 and this resulted in adjustments to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2006 and to the balance sheet at that date.
Further details are provided in note 44.
Programme participation costs Programme participation costs have been reclassified from other receivables to intangible assets.
Programme participation costs were previously referred to as deferred costs in the Groups 2006 consolidated financial statements.
Rights issue Earnings per share and dividends per share data for prior years have been restated for the bonus element of the rights issue approved by the shareholders of the Group in 2007.
The factor applied to reflect the bonus element was 1.16814.
