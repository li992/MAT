14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 67 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with European Union EU Endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of Investment Properties taken through the income statement.
IFRSs also require an alternative treatment to the historic cost convention in certain circumstances principally in the areas of retirement benefit obligations, share based payments and financial instruments.
The income statement has been simplified in 2007 to provide a clearer presentation of the results with profit on sale of operating property, plant and equipment and coal investment aid included in other operating income and expenses.
The following standard is effective for the first time in 2007.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
It does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Group or Companys financial instruments or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
In preparing the 2007 financial statements, UK COAL has not applied the following pronouncements which are not yet effective and which have not been adopted early by the Group or Company.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009.
The expected impact is still being assessed in detail by management, but it appears likely that the number of reportable segments, as well as the manner in which the segments are reported, will not change materially from our current internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The standard is effective from 1 January 2008 and the amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the EU.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The Group will apply IAS 23 Amended from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is currently not applicable to the Group as there are no borrowings directly attributable to qualifying assets.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction effective from 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance in assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Group or Companys accounts.
Going concern In forming its opinion as to going concern, the Board prepares a working capital forecast based upon its assumptions as to trading as well as taking into account the available borrowing facilities in line with the Treasury Policy noted in the Directors Report.
The Board also prepares a number of alternative scenarios modelling the business variables and key risks and uncertainties, both as summarised in the Operating and Financial Review.
Based upon these, the Board has concluded that the Group has adequate working capital and the Board has therefore concluded that it is appropriate to use the going concern basis of preparation for the financial statements of the Company and the Group.

Subsidiaries are entities over which UK COAL has power to govern the financial and operating policies.
Control is presumed to exist where UK COAL owns more than half of the voting rights, unless in exceptional circumstances where it can be demonstrated that ownership does not constitute control.
The consolidated financial statements includes all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries, after eliminating intercompany balances and transactions.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the consolidated income statement up to, or from, the date control passes.
UK COAL uses the purchase method of accounting to consolidate subsidiaries.
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities being acquired are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Accounting policies are changed where necessary to bring them into line with those adopted by UK COAL.
The interest of any minority shareholders is stated as the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement.
Interests in joint ventures through which the Group carries on its business are classified as jointly controlled entities and accounted for using the equity method.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns or whose operational characteristics are different to those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products and services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
The Group manages its business primarily by reference to business segments, and this approach is adopted in the accounting policies as the primary segment.
Deep mining comprises the underground mining operations of the Group and related labour services and other operations.
Surface mining incorporates all mining activities at surface level, together with the plant hire operations of the Group.
The Power division represents that portion of the Group which generates power, either for internal or external sale.
The Property division, Harworth Estates, maintains, develops and rents the Groups property portfolio.
Any activities not falling into any of these categories is included in the other segment.
As the Group is based and operates in a single geographical market, the United Kingdom, no secondary segmentation is provided.
Revenue Revenue comprises sales excluding intra-Group sales of coal, property rental income, and other external sales, including sales of power and of labour services.
Coal transactions Revenue is recognised when delivery of the product or service has been made and when the customer has a legally binding obligation to settle under the terms of the contract and has assumed all significant risks and rewards of ownership.
A large proportion of production is sold under medium to long-term contracts.
Revenue is only recognised on individual sales when all of the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
In most instances revenue is recognised when the product is delivered to the location specified by the customer, which is typically when dispatched, where the customer pays the transportation costs.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 69 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Service transactions Rental income is recognised during the period in which rents due to the Group accrue.
Sales of power are recognised when electricity is transferred into the local distribution network.
Trading and non-trading exceptional items Items that are both material and non-recurring and whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure and identification within the consolidated financial statements are referred to as Exceptional Items and disclosed within their relevant income statement category.
Items that may give rise to classification as Exceptional Items include, but are not limited to, significant and material restructuring closures and reorganisation programmes, asset impairments, and profits or losses on the disposal of businesses.
Exceptional items are divided into non-trading and trading exceptional items, depending upon the impact of the event giving rise to the cost or income on the ongoing trading operations and the nature of the costs or income involved.
Non-trading exceptional items include costs and income arising from closure, rationalisation and business disposals.
Property related transactions, including changes in the fair value of Investment Properties, and profits and losses arising on the disposal of property assets are not included in the definition of Exceptional Items as they are expected to recur, but are separately disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement, where material.
Coal Investment Aid Coal Investment Aid is received as a contribution towards qualifying expenditure, as defined by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform DBERR, incurred by UK COAL.
If the expenditure has been charged in the consolidated income statement then the related Investment Aid is credited to the consolidated income statement in the same period.
Where the Investment Aid relates to the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the Investment Aid is held on the consolidated balance sheet as deferred income and is credited to the consolidated income statement over the lives of the assets to which it relates.
Investment Properties and Operating Properties The Group holds the following types of freehold property: Working deep mines in production Working surface mines in production Property held for administrative purposes Property held for rental income, capital appreciation or both Working deep mines in production, working surface mines in production, and property held for administrative purposes are held as Operating Properties as these assets are used or intended to be used within the operations of the Group and are accounted for at historic depreciated cost, in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
All other freehold properties are held as Investment Properties as these are held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both and are accounted for at valuation and in accordance with IAS 40 Investment property or, if appropriate, in inventories as assets held for disposal.
Investment Properties Investment Properties comprise freehold land and buildings and are measured at fair value.
The fair values are determined by obtaining an independent valuation prepared in accordance with the current edition of the Appraisal and Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
External, independent valuation firms having appropriate, recognised professional qualifications and recent experience in the location and category of the property being valued, value the portfolio at each reporting date.
69 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 70 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued In accordance with IAS 40, any difference between the book value of an Investment Property and the first valuation on recognition as an Investment Property is taken to reserves.
Subsequent gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of assets are recognised in the consolidated income statement, net of any clawback on deemed disposal.
Investment properties are not depreciated.
Properties being held for their long-term rental income or capital appreciation but with the added potential for coal extraction are held as Investment Properties, being transferred to Operating Properties at fair value when planning permission to mine the site has been received and mining operations have commenced, and are transferred back to Investment Properties once mining has terminated.
Where the development of Investment Property commences with a view to sale, the property is transferred from Investment Properties to inventories at fair value, which is then considered to represent deemed cost.
Investment Property which is held with a view for sale without development, is retained within Investment Properties.
Operating Properties Operating Properties which are acquired or constructed are initially recorded at cost, being the purchase price of the asset and other costs incurred to bring the asset into existing use, and subsequently stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation other than freehold land which is not depreciated.
Where properties are transferred from Investment Properties to Operating Properties, this transfer is made at fair value, which is then considered to represent deemed cost.
Properties which have historically been used as working deep mines or working surface mines Operating Properties are transferred to property held for rental income or capital appreciation Investment Properties at the point when a decision is made to pursue planning with a view to future development or rental, and once mining has ceased.
IAS 16 is applied up to the date of transfer and any difference at that date between the book value and fair value is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Operating Properties: surface mines Costs incurred prior to coaling in respect of surface mines are held in debtors as deferred costs.
Once coaling has commenced, these costs are transferred to surface mine development and restoration assets and a separate provision for the outstanding restoration and rehabilitation obligations is also established.
Both of these costs are then charged to the consolidated Income Statement net of any residual value over the recoverable reserves of the mine.
Expenditure on sites not expected to be worked within ten years is written off.
Overburden and other mine waste materials are often removed during the initial development of a mine site in order to access the mineral deposit.
This activity is referred to as development stripping.
The directly attributable costs inclusive of an allocation of relevant overhead expenditure are capitalised as surface mine development assets and are amortised together with restoration and pre-coaling costs, once coaling commences, over the tonnage of coal expected to be extracted.
Property clawback Under the terms of the 1994 privatisation Sale and Purchase Agreement, DBERR is entitled to a percentage of any property gain above certain thresholds and after deducting an amount representing corporation tax thereon accruing, or treated as accruing to UK COAL, as a result of the disposal or deemed disposal or major development of certain properties acquired at privatisation.
The percentage applied is 36% for 2007, reducing by 3 percentage points per annum until 31 March 2015, when it reduces to zero.
If properties are disposed of, or are deemed to have been disposed of during this period, a part of the relevant gain will become payable to DBERR.
A liability for clawback in respect of property disposals is recognised only when an actual or deemed disposal occurs.
A liability for clawback on a deemed disposal as a result of granting a lease is recognised over the life of the lease.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 71 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Properties in the course of development Directly attributable costs incurred in the course of developing a property are capitalised as part of the cost of the property.
For Operating Properties amortisation of these costs follows the depreciation policy for the property.
Development costs on Investment Properties are capitalised and the change in value is recognised through the next revaluation.
Profit or loss on disposal Disposals are accounted for when legal completion of the sale has occurred or there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts.
Profits or losses on disposal arise from deducting the assets net carrying value from the net proceeds being net purchase consideration less clawback liability arising on disposal and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Net carrying value includes valuation in the case of Investment Properties and historic cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation in the case of all other property, plant and equipment.
In the case of Investment Properties, the revaluation reserve in relation to the property disposed of is treated as realised on disposal of the property and transferred to retained earnings.
Plant and equipment The cost of plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in accordance with agreed specifications.
Plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
On conversion to IFRS, UK COAL opted to continue to measure operating property, plant and equipment excluding Investment Properties at historic cost, less accumulated depreciation, in the consolidated balance sheet.
Colliery assets Mine development The purpose of mine development is to access and establish infrastructure in order to allow the safe and efficient extraction of recoverable reserves.
Depreciation on mine development is charged from the time when full production commences or from when the assets are put to use.
On commencement of full production, depreciation is charged over the estimated tonnage of the recoverable reserves.
Coal extracted prior to the commencement of full production is credited against the cost of mine development.
Mines and surface works Assets acquired on the privatisation of British Coal in 1994 were valued at discounted net recoverable value, based on the contemporary mining plans, in accordance with the accounting guidance existing at that time.
Depreciation is charged over the estimated recoverable reserves.
Subsequent additions to mines and surface works are accounted for at cost, and depreciated over their individual estimated reserves.
Seismic and geological mapping costs Expenditure on seismic and geological mapping costs which increases the value of the reserves by identifying additional reserves over and above those previously recognised, or increases the value of the existing known reserves by providing information which enables reserve estimates to be increased, is capitalised.
This expenditure is amortised over the estimated production over the shorter of four years or the life of the associated reserves.
If the information does not fulfil either of these criteria, the cost is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
71 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 72 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Depreciation The costs of Operating Properties, excluding freehold land, and the cost of all other plant and equipment, less estimated residual value, are written off on a straight-line basis over the assets expected useful life.
Residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Changes to the estimated residual values or useful lives are accounted for prospectively.
The costs of heavy surface mining and other plant and equipment are depreciated at varying rates depending upon their expected usage.
Indicative expected lives for non-current assets are set out below: Freehold land not depreciated Operating Properties excluding land 25 to 50 years Mines and surface works Heavy mining equipment 8 to 20 years Plant and equipment Plant and equipment 3 to 15 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Impairment Operating property, plant and equipment and finite life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if there is any indication that their carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are tested for impairment annually.
The carrying value of cash generating units taking into account related liabilities and allocated central net assets is tested for impairment on a regular basis by comparison with expected relevant future cash flows discounted at the cost of capital taking into account appropriate risk: provision is made for any impairment identified.
Cash generating units comprise individual mines or groups of mines depending upon the nature of the income streams derived from each.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of value in use being the present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant cash generating unit or fair value less costs to sell.
Where there is no binding sale agreement or active market, fair value less costs to sell is based on the best information available to reflect the amount UK COAL could receive for the cash generating unit in an arms length transaction.
Future cash flows are based on: estimates of the quantities of the reserves and resources for which there is a high degree of confidence of economic extraction anticipated production levels and costs anticipated coal prices The impairment testing is carried out under the principles described in IAS 36 Impairment of assets which includes a number of restrictions on the future cash flows that can be recognised in respect of restructurings and improvement related to capital expenditure.
Hire purchases and leases as lessee Leases which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to UK COAL are treated as finance leases.
All other leases are treated as operating leases.
Assets held under hire purchase and finance lease arrangements are capitalised and written off according to the depreciation rate of the applicable asset category.
The outstanding capital obligations are included in creditors.
Interest is allocated to accounting periods over the hire purchase or lease term to reflect a constant rate of charge on the remaining balance of the obligation.
Costs in respect of the operating leases are charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 73 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Hire purchases and leases as lessor The Group grants leases over land and buildings in the course of its property business.
These do not substantially transfer the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, and therefore they are accounted for as operating leases.
Financial instruments UK COAL recognises financial instruments when it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual right to receive the cash flows expire or it has transferred the financial asset and the economic benefit of the cash flows.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Financial instruments are used to support UK COALs trading operations.
Interest is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred or earned.
Issue costs of debt instruments are charged to the consolidated income statement over the term of the relevant facility.
From time to time, UK COAL may hold derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates.
Derivatives are designated as hedges, when applicable, and treated as such from the inception of the relevant contracts.
Gains or losses on hedging instruments are recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
Gains or losses arising from cancellation of hedging instruments due to the termination of the underlying transaction are taken to the consolidated income statement immediately.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swap agreements are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Financial instruments are recorded initially at cost.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: a Financial assets liabilities held for trading or short-term gain, including derivatives and embedded derivatives other than hedging instruments, are measured at fair value and movements in fair value are credited charged to the consolidated income statement in the period.
b Held to maturity investments, including those with a fixed maturity date, are measured at amortised cost.
c Loans and receivables payables and non-derivative financial assets liabilities with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, are measured at amortised cost.
These are included in current assets liabilities except for instruments that mature after more than 12 months which are included in non-current assets liabilities.
d Available-for-sale financial assets, which are either those designated for sale or those not classified in any of the other categories, are measured at fair value.
Movements in fair values are recognised directly in equity and these instruments are included in non-current assets unless the intention is to dispose of them within 12 months.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of UK COAL is sterling.
Transactions in other currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates and the resulting exchange rate differences are included in the consolidated income statement within the results of operating activities if arising from trading activities and within finance cost income if arising from financing.
For consolidation purposes, income and expense items are included in the consolidated income statement at average rates, and assets and liabilities are translated at year end exchange rates.
Where foreign operations are disposed of, the cumulative exchange differences of that foreign operation are recognised in the consolidated income statement when the gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Values of spares and consumables are based on average purchase prices.
Appropriate provisions are made for slow-moving and obsolete stock.
Coal is recognised as stock when delivered to the surface and is valued at the average cost of extraction.
73 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 74 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Cash and cash equivalents In the preparation of UK COALs cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents represent short-term liquid investments which are readily realisable.
Cash which is subject to restrictions, being held to match certain liabilities, is included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet.
Restoration and closure costs Surface mines The total costs of reinstatement of soil excavation and rehabilitation are recognised as a provision for site decommissioning when the obligation arises, usually considered to be once coaling starts.
A non-current asset is created within the surface mine development and restoration assets at an amount equal to this initial provision.
The amount provided represents the discounted net present value of the expected costs.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs.
Deep mines Closure costs relating to shaft treatment and pit top restoration are recognised as a provision on a discounted basis on the commissioning of the colliery or on acquisition.
Costs are charged to the provision as incurred and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs for the year.
An equivalent asset is created within property, plant and equipment at an amount equal to the initial provision.
Costs of restoring spoil heaps are provided for on acquisition to the extent that an obligation has been incurred and, thereafter, on a unit of production basis as the additional obligation arises.
Provision for other colliery closure costs is made only when there is a demonstrable commitment to the colliery closure.
Other Provisions Pumping costs Pumping costs are provided where there is a legal requirement to continue pumping activities at certain mines following closure and at other pumping facilities for a period into the future.
The provision is based on current experience and is calculated using the discounted net present value of future estimated costs.
Pumping costs on continuing operations are expensed as incurred.
Ground and groundwater contamination A provision is established for the estimated costs of rectifying ground and groundwater contamination when a legal or constructive obligation is identified and can be quantified.
Surface damage Provision is made for the estimated cost of damage to structures on the surface as a result of settlement following underground mining.
The provision is calculated in respect of each colliery, location of mining activity and type of property affected or likely to be affected based on claims expected and claims submitted and using historical settlement experience.
The provision made represents the discounted net present value of the expenditure estimated to settle the current or estimated prospective obligation.
Employer and public liability claims UK COAL has established a DBERR approved and Financial Services Authority FSA regulated UK based insurance subsidiary Harworth Insurance Company Limited.
This insures employer and public liability risks, buying reinsurance with third parties above certain levels.
Provision is made for the estimated value of both known, and incurred but not reported, third party claims on an actuarially determined basis taking into account expected reinsurance recoveries.
Where these claims are expected to be settled over a longer period of time, the provision made represents the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 75 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Redundancy Provision is made for redundancy costs when there is a demonstrable commitment to terminate the employment of either an employee or group of employees.
The expected amounts of redundancy payments, including any amounts in respect of ex gratia payments, are provided where the employment terminations have been communicated to employees.
Where contributions to redundancy costs have been firmly committed by third parties, these contributions are credited to the consolidated income statement in the same period to the extent that the related redundancy cost has been recognised.
Employee Benefits Pension obligations The Group operates defined contribution schemes in respect of all employees who joined after the privatisation date in 1994.
The cost of this is charged to the consolidated income statement as incurred.
The Group also operates pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The majority of the employees within defined benefit schemes are members of industry-wide schemes, being either the Industry Wide Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme IWCSSS or the Industry Wide Mineworkers Pension Scheme IWMPS, both of which commenced on privatisation following the Coal Industry Act 1994.
The assets of the Schemes are held separately from those of UK COAL, being funds administered by Trustees of the Schemes.
A qualified actuary assesses the cost of current service and reviews the Schemes valuations annually for the purposes of IAS 19.
A full valuation for funding purposes is carried out by the Schemes actuaries triennially.
UK COAL accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value and plan assets are recorded at fair value.
Service costs are charged systematically over the service lives of employees and financing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Concessionary fuel Provision is made for the estimated liability arising from the obligation to provide concessionary fuel benefits to retired employees.
The costs of the concessionary fuel benefits are determined annually by a qualified actuary.
The arrangement is unfunded so no assets are held directly to meet the obligations.
The regular service cost and interest on the scheme liabilities are charged to the consolidated income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are charged to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Share based payments The fair value of share plans is recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement over the expected vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of share plans is determined at the date of grant, taking into account any market based vesting conditions attached to the award.
Non-market based vesting conditions e. g. earnings per share targets are taken into account in estimating the number of awards likely to vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed regularly and the expense charged adjusted accordingly.
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated using a generally accepted simulation model.
The proceeds received, net of any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium any increment when the options are exercised.
On conversion to IFRS, UK COAL, in recognising fair values of share-based payments to employees, chose to apply the exemption only to include those awards made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested at 31 December 2003 in its calculations at the date of transition.
Taxation Current Tax The charge or credit for current tax is based on the results for the year adjusted for items that are either not subject to taxation or for expenditure which cannot be deducted in computing the tax charge or credit.
The tax charge or credit is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
75 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 76 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Deferred Tax Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary imbalances in the tax charge, arising from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all taxable temporary timing differences, except that deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
In deciding whether future reversal is more likely than not, the Directors review the Groups forecasts and make a prudent estimate of the aggregate deferred tax asset that should be recognised.
This aggregate deferred tax asset is then allocated into the different categories of deferred tax, taking account of the fact that the deferred tax asset in relation to the pension deficit will be recognised over a longer period, as the pension liability reverses over the average remaining service life of employees.
In relation to Investment Properties, a deferred tax liability is provided on the basis of normal income tax rules for the proportion of the propertys carrying amount expected to be recovered through use and is provided using capital gains tax rules in respect of the remainder of the propertys carrying amount including all land expected to be recovered through sale.
In the case of the latter, no liability is recognised where the Group has sufficient unrecognised capital losses to cover the future tax obligations arising from these gains.
Provision is made for gains on disposal of property, plant and equipment that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except where it applies to items credited or charged to equity, in which case the deferred tax is included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
UK Emissions Trading Scheme Income arising from reductions in carbon emissions to the atmosphere as part of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme is credited to the consolidated income statement within other operating income in the year in which the credits are earned to the extent that it is virtually certain that the income entitlement is established.
Surplus credits above this entitlement are not valued and are therefore not recognised in the financial statements until such time as they are sold to third parties.
Borrowing costs Borrowings are recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred which are amortised over the term of the associated borrowings.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the consolidated statement over the period of the borrowings using effective interest method.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised in the financial statements in the year in which the dividends are paid in the case of interim dividends or approved by the Companys shareholders in the case of final dividends.
Significant judgements Management exercises significant judgement in the determination of the provisions required in respect of restoration and closure costs.
Amounts provided are based on management experience and historical out-turns, together with such external expert assistance as is deemed appropriate.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 77 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Key assumptions and estimates Amounts in the consolidated financial statements that are subject to significant estimates are as follows: a Investment Property Valuations.
The fair value of Investment Property reflects, amongst other things, rental income from our current leases, assumptions about rental income from future leases and the possible outcome of planning applications, in the light of current market conditions.
A change in fair values could have a material impact on the Groups results.
These are subject to actuarial estimates of, amongst other items, rate of return on investments, rate of salary increases, rate of price inflation, the cost of funding future liabilities and post-retirement life expectancy.
Details of the significant estimates used are set out in note 23. c Mine development costs.
Capitalised mine development costs deep and surface mines are amortised over the tonnage of coal expected to be extracted in the future.
If the amount of coal expected to be extracted varies, this will impact on the amount of the asset which should be carried in the consolidated balance sheet.
Estimated provisions are established in the consolidated balance sheet and amortised in proportion to the coal expected to be extracted from a site.
If that expected tonnage or the actual cost varies, then the provision may be under or over stated.
The provisions are disclosed in note 21. e Deferred taxation.
The recognition of deferred tax assets requires considerable judgement as to the future profitability of the mining business.
The recognition of a deferred tax liability in relation to property revaluations requires an estimate to be made of the proportion of the value of a property which will be recovered through use, compared to the proportion of the value which will be recovered through sale.
In the case of the latter, the Group does not recognise any tax liability as a result of its significant brought forward capital losses, as disclosed in note 8.

As the Group operates in a single geographical market, the United Kingdom, no secondary segmentation is provided.
The operations are divided into the following segments: Deep mining The Group operated 4 ongoing deep mines in 2007 located in Central and Northern England.
The Group has estimated total reserves and resources of around 105 million tonnes.
Closed sold deep mines comprise Rossington and Harworth collieries and Maltby colliery which was sold in February 2007.
Surface mining The Group has 6 active surface mines and planning consent to mine a further site.
Planning consents in respect of estimated surface mine reserves of 14 million tonnes have either already been granted, applied for or are planned to be applied for during 2008.
Power The Group has its own power capability, which utilises waste gas from mines to generate electricity and is actively pursuing the development of alternative power generation opportunities, including wind farms.
Property The Group has a portfolio of around 46,500 acres and has identified some 3,696 net acres of this land as offering prime prospects for a mix of business park, residential, distribution and community development.
Other This includes any activities not already included within one of the above segments, the results of joint ventures and any unallocated items.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items before non-trading exceptional items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly interest-bearing borrowings and taxation.

The differences are explained below: 2007 2006 000 000 Profit before taxation 69,023 17,635 Profit before taxation multiplied by rate of Corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30% 20,707 5,291 Effects of: Expenses not deducted income not chargeable for tax purposes 22,222 19,659 Deferred tax recognised not recognised 23,485 14,511 Total taxation credit charge 25,000 143 The tax credit at 31 December 2007 relates to the recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses.
These losses have been recognised at 31 December 2007 due to the reduction in the deferred tax asset relating to the pension liability and not any change in forecast Group profitability.
The credit recognised in the consolidated income statement is approximate to the change recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense, reflecting the fact there is no overall material change in the amount of deferred tax asset being recognised by the Group.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% 2006: 30%.
Deferred tax asset and liability are offset when there is a legally enforced right to offset current tax asset against current tax liability and when the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The Groups deferred tax liability in respect of fixed assets can all be offset in this way, apart from the 815,000 liability in respect of revaluation gains on Investment Properties to be recovered through use.

Other deferred tax assets have not been recognised owing to the uncertainty as to their recoverability.
If all deferred tax assets were recognised, the total assets would be 103,615,000 2006: 110,394,000 as set out below.

No tax liability has been recognised in relation to the balance of the gain which is expected to be realised through sale of Investment Properties, due to the fact that the Group has unrecognised capital losses brought forward of 381,000,000 2006: 401,100,000.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2007 Budget Statement, some of which are expected to be enacted in the 2008 Finance Act.
These changes, namely the phased withdrawal of Industrial Building Allowances, had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes to be enacted in the 2008 Finance Act would be an immaterial change to the deferred tax provided at 31 December 2007.
The movement on deferred tax asset charged credited to equity during the year is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Impact on deferred tax asset due to change in tax rate 2,383 Movement on deferred tax asset relating to retirement benefit liabilities in the period 22,012 35,752 Deferred tax asset movement charged credited to equity 24,395 35,752 The Company has no recognised or unrecognised deferred tax in 2007 and 2006.

11 EARNINGS PER SHARE Earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year.
In calculating diluted profit per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares is adjusted for the diluting effect of share options potentially issuable under the Groups employee share option plans.

It should be noted that these are based on the information available at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared and are subject to a number of estimates and uncertainties, as noted below.
This included a net credit of 5,702,000 2006: 1,995,000 in respect of non-trading exceptional items.
The nature of the Groups obligations and an indication of the uncertainties surrounding each of the above provisions is set out below: Employer and public liabilities provisions are made for current and estimated obligations in respect of claims made by employees, contractors and the general public relating to accident or disease as a result of the business activities of the Group, relating primarily to the claims held by the Groups captive insurance company, Harworth Insurance Limited.
Security over land and buildings and dedicated cash deposits, as set out in notes 13 and 18, has been granted to cover these provisions.
Surface damage provision is made for the Groups liability to compensate for subsidence damage arising from past mining operations.
Claims can be lodged by the public up to six years after the date of relevant damage.
The estimate is based on historical claims experience, following a detailed assessment of the nature of the damage foreseen.
Security over land and buildings and dedicated cash deposits, as set out in notes 12 and 18, has been granted to cover these provisions.
The provisions provided of 16,590,000 includes 14,490,000 in relation to amounts capitalised as a non-current asset within surface mine development and restoration assets.
The remaining difference relates to provisions provided following management reassessment of requirements.
Claims where surface mine sites owned by the Group are mined by external contractors and mining conditions vary from those specified in the contract, the external contractors may be entitled to claim further costs incurred.
Claims are settled with individual contractors, generally on the completion of a surface mining site.
All claims provisions are based on known mining conditions encountered, historical experience and contracted rates.
Restoration and closure costs of surface mines provisions are made for the total costs of reinstatement of soil excavation and for surface restoration, such as topsoil replacement and landscaping.
Costs become payable after coal mining has been completed.
Further liabilities for aftercare can extend after restoration, for a period of up to six years.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 95 21 PROVISIONS continued Restoration and closure costs of deep mines: Shaft treatment and pit top provisions are made to meet the Groups liability to fill and cap all mine shafts and return pit top areas to a condition consistent with the required planning permission.
No liabilities will arise until decommissioning of each individual colliery.
The current pit top provisions reflect existing planning permissions that require pit areas to be restored to former use, usually agricultural.
The Group will, where possible, seek planning permission for development use, which, if successful, may reduce the expected cost.
Spoil heaps provisions are made for the costs payable to bring spoil heaps to a condition consistent with the required planning permission and to complete approved restoration schemes.
An element of spoil heap restoration is ongoing, although the majority of costs will be incurred after the decommissioning of a colliery.
Pumping costs there is a legal requirement to continue pumping activities at certain mine sites following closure and for a period into the future.
The provision is based on current experience and the net present value of future cost projections.
Ground groundwater contamination provisions are made for the Groups legal or constructive obligation to address ground and groundwater pollutants at its operating sites.
The provision is based on estimates of volumes of contaminated soil and the historical contract costs of ground contamination treatment.
These costs will usually be incurred following the decommissioning of a site.
Redundancy provision is made for current estimated future costs of redundancy and ex gratia payments to be made where this has been communicated to those employees concerned.
22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments and investment of excess liquidity.
a Market risk i Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain its borrowings predominantly in fixed rate instruments using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2007 and 2006, the Groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in UK pounds.
95 14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 96 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued The Group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Generally, the Group raises long-term borrowings at floating rates and swaps them into fixed rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed at fixed rates directly.
Under the interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
At 31 December 2007, if interest rates on UK pound-denominated borrowings at that date had been 2% higher or lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 2,983,000 2006: 2,779,000 lower or higher, mainly as a result of higher or lower interest expense on floating rate borrowings which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
ii Foreign exchange risk No foreign exchange contracts were entered into during 2007 and the Group does not have any material foreign currency exposure.
b Credit risk Credit risk or financial instruments is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
If our customers are independently rated, these ratings are used.
Otherwise, if there is no independent rating, risk control assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal or external ratings in accordance with limits set by the Board.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
The table below shows the balance of our major counterparties which give rise to credit risk at the balance sheet date.
2007 2006 Balance Balance Counterparty Rating 000 000 Scottish Widows AA- 23,403 22,748 Lloyds TSB AA 17,000 Electricity Supply Industry customers 17,740 28,291 Our Electricity Supply Industry customers are rated between A to BBB-.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period and management does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
14705 09 04 2008 Proof 14 14705UKCOAL :14705UKCOAL 10 4 08 09:59 Page 97 22 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c Liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to demonstrate funding adequacy for at least a 12 month period.
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group only takes into account existing or renewing facilities and new facilities where these have received credit approval.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash outflows inflows.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The gearing ratios for the Group at 31 December 2007 and 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Total borrowings 125,241 97,765 Less: Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents note 18 20,973 3,627 Net debt 104,268 94,138 Total equity 358,246 244,119 Total capital 462,514 338,257 Gearing ratio 22.5% 27.8% The decrease in the gearing ratio during 2007 resulted primarily from the increase in net assets and cash and cash equivalents at year end.

The majority of the employees within defined benefit schemes are members of industry wide schemes, being either the Industry Wide Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme IWCSSS or the Industry Wide Mineworkers Pension Scheme IWMPS, both of which commenced on privatisation following the Coal Industry Act 1994.
The pension schemes values are reviewed annually by qualified independent actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 and the preparation of the financial statements.
The assumptions which usually have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are the discount rate, which is based on bond yields, and the rates of increases in salaries and pensions.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations of the UK COAL sections of each scheme were as follows: 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.80% p. a.
Rate of return on investments 6.70% p. a.
Rate of salary increases 3.30% p. a.
Rate of price inflation 3.30% p. a.
Rate of return on equities 7.00% p. a.
Rate of cash commutation 22.50% p. a.

For the IWMPS the assumed pension increase depends on the period of service accrual before April 1997: no increases, 1997 to 2005: in line with price inflation, after April 2005: 1% below price inflation.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is based on a historic view of the yields from equities and the rates prevailing on applicable bonds at the balance sheet date.
None of the pension schemes owns any shares in the Company.

BRITAINS BIGGEST PRODUCER OF COAL, UK COAL SUPPLIES AROUND OUR LOCATIONS 5% OF THE COUNTRYS ENERGY NEEDS FOR ELECTRICITY GENERATION AND EMPLOYS 3,100 PEOPLE WITHIN THE GROUP.
ONE OF BRITAINS LARGEST BROWNFIELD SITE PROPERTY DEVELOPERS, Deep Mines UK COAL OWNS A SUBSTANTIAL LAND PORTFOLIO, WHICH IT IS IN THE Operating Surface Mines PROCESS OF DEVELOPING.
Principal Development Sites MINING AND POWER DEEP MINING The Group operates 4 deep mines, located in Central and Northern England.
The Group has reserves and resources of over 100 million tonnes at these mines.
SURFACE MINING At the end of 2007, the Group had 6 active surface mines and planning consent to mine a further site.
The Group has applied for planning consents for a further 4 mines and expects to make applications for a further 6 sites during 2008.
Total surface mining reserves available for planning are estimated at approximately 97 million tonnes.
POWER GENERATION UK COAL has 29 MW of electrical power generation capacity, utilising waste gas from mines.
It is actively pursuing the development of alternative power generation opportunities, including wind farms and has recently acquired planning consent for its first 9 MW wind farm.
HARWORTH ESTATES UK COAL owns some 46,500 acres 18,818 hectares of predominantly agricultural land.
Within this, some 3,696 net acres have been identified as offering prime prospects for development into a mix of residential, business park, distribution and community developments over the medium to longer term.
At 31 December 2007, the Groups property interests, excluding the deep mine sites, had a current open market value of 411 million.
We estimate, however, that, with the benefit of currently envisaged planning consents, at 2007 prices, our land portfolio would have a worth of some 935 million by 2012, and in excess of 1 billion by 2013, in each case with the potential for further development phase value uplift.
