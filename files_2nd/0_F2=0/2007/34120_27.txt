From 15 January 2007, the Group has REIT status.
As a result the Group will no longer pay UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.
On entering the REIT regime a conversion charge equal to 2% of the aggregate market value of the properties associated with the qualifying rental business is payable.
Deferred tax accrued at the date of conversion in respect of the assets and liabilities of the qualifying rental business has been released to the income statement, as the relevant timing differences will no longer be taxable when they reverse.
