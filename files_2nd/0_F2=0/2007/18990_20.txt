On the Groups admission to the Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange on 21 June 2005, 291,308 ordinary shares were granted and issued in the names of Plan members subject to certain vesting conditions.
A further 13,059 new shares were granted and issued on 17 March 2006.
Vesting takes place over periods of three to five years from the date of issue and is conditional on employees remaining in employment: there are no performance conditions.
During the vesting period, the participants receive dividends and the shares may be sold, but the proceeds of any sale are subject to the same vesting terms as the shares.
Two further awards of 2,173 shares and 45,740 shares were granted on 8 May 2006 and 14 December 2006 respectively and were issued out of shares that had been returned to the Company as a result of members withdrawing from the Plan.
Following these issues, 19,686 shares remained having been returned to the Company 2006: 698 shares.
The total cost to the Group of shares issued under the Plan of 8.8million 2006: 8.8million is to be spread over the relevant vesting periods: 30% will vest on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant and the remaining 40% will vest on the last business day before the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
Non-executive Director share benefit expense During 2005 four Non-executive Directors were each awarded 15,000 ordinary shares.
5,000 shares each vested on the date of grant and after each of the first two annual general meetings following the date of appointment.
The final tranche was issued in June 2007.
The total cost to the Group of shares issued or granted to Non-executive Directors during the year ended 31 December 2005 of 1,438,000 has been fully expensed as at 31 December 2007.

This has been calculated by dividing 1 Group companies' profits before tax multiplied by the tax rate applicable for each Group company by 2 the Group's profit before tax, given that the Group operates in various different tax jurisdictions.
During the year the enacted UK income tax and corporation rates applicable from 1 April 2008 were reduced to 20% and 28% respectively.

The Group has not recognised deferred income tax assets in respect of some of these losses as stated above.
In addition, the Group has the following unrecognised deferred tax assets.
The assets have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over both the amount and the timing of utilisation Deductible temporary differences, unutilised losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax asset is recognised and the tax effect of such items is shown below.

The reduced tax rate was included in the Finance Bill 2007.
The Finance Bill passed through the House of Commons on 27 June 2007 and is therefore considered substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
As a result, where applicable, deferred tax balances have been calculated at 28% or 20% in respect of UK incorporated companies or other Group companies with UK businesses.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share gures is based on the following: Net loss attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 124.9million year ended 31 December 2006: profit of 53.7million.
Weighted average number of ordinary shares after deducting 19,686 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan during the year for basic earnings per share: 29,417,876 year ended 31 December 2006: 26,887,700 after deducting 698 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan.
Weighted average number of ordinary shares after deducting 19,686 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan during the year for diluted earnings per share: 29,417,876 year ended 31 December 2006: 26,903,833 after deducting 698 treasury shares relinquished by members of the employee share plan.
The difference between the number of shares used for the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation in 2006 of 16,133 represented the weighted average number of shares awarded but not yet issued to Non-Executive Directors.
All shares awarded under this scheme have now been issued.
There have been no other transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of the financial statements.

Property, plant and equipment continued Freehold property and property acquired under finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment where the Group provides significant ancillary services to tenants, and are carried at fair value.
During the year, certain of the Groups non-investment properties have been written down by an amount of 0.4million 2006: nil.
The impairment adjustment has been charged to the current years income statement reecting the amount of the impairment below their historical cost values.
Freehold property held at 31 December 2007 of 473.9million 2006: 479.2million and the majority of the property acquired under finance leases at 31 December 2007 of 41.5million 2006: 41.7million were valued at 31 December 2007 by CB Richard Ellis Limited CBRE, a valuer external to the Group, as part of the valuation of all the valuable properties held by the Group under the HMRC contract.
At 31 December 2006 the valuation was performed by Savills Commercial Limited Savills.
During the period the contract for the valuation of the HMRC Estate was re-tendered through a competitive process.
The preferred bidder was selected to ensure best value and a consistent scope of methodology across the portfolios.
These valuations have been incorporated into the annual financial statements.
CBRE have consented to the use of their name in these financial statements.
The total of this valuation at 31 December 2007 was 563.4million 2006: 560.1million and an analysis of where the assets valued are recorded in the financial statements is shown in the table below: 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 m m Freehold property 473.9 479.2 Property acquired under finance leases 41.5 41.7 Minimum payments under head leases 2.1 2.2 Recorded in property, plant and equipment 517.5 523.1 Properties held within premiums on operating leases at amortised cost of 32.2million 2006: 35.2million 33.6 39.2 Properties held as non-current assets held for sale at net book value on transfer of 9.1million.

They are carried at the lower of carrying value and fair value of 9.1million 2006: nil see note 13.
Long leasehold properties with a valuation of 33.6million 2006: 39.2million are classied as premiums on operating leases and are recorded at historical cost less amortisation of 32.2million 2006: 35.2million see note 12.
The valuation at 31 December 2007 has been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' RICS Valuation Standards, Sixth Edition the Red Book.
At 31 December 2006 the valuation was carried out in accordance with the Fifth Edition of the Red Book.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is dened as follows: The estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2007 71 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 10.
Property, plant and equipment continued The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specic to the Group: For the purpose of the valuations, the properties have been valued as part of a portfolio.
The valuations assume that the contract is freely assignable in the open market.
No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation nor for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property.
The valuations are, however, net of purchase costs if any.
Purchasers' costs have been deducted in arriving at the valuations.
These are based on 1% agents fees, 0.5% legal fees fees include VAT at 17.5% and stamp duty land tax at the relevant rate, dependent upon the value of each property.
Under the terms of the contract with HMRC, it is entitled to bring a proportion of its leases to an end earlier than the 20-year term and vacate the premises subject to i 12 months' notice: and ii agreed limits on the amount and type of space that can be vacated each year.
The possibility of HMRC exercising these break provisions has been accounted for in each respective part of the portfolio i. e. core, exible and intermediate property.
The risk of the tenants ability to break any leases is then factored on each individual component part by assessing the average income at risk in the event of the tenant breaking such lease.
The annual at risk income is then capitalised at an appropriate rate over a term of three years to include marketing and incentive void, an amount for letting fees, minor refurbishment costs and void rates and amortised for a number of years until either the space in that component part has been exhumed or until 2019 i. e. two years from expiry when the tenant no longer has an ability to break.
HMRC pays the Group amounts under the contract which cover the charge both for the accommodation provided and the related services.
The payment is subject to deductions for failures to meet specified performance standards and unavailability for use.
Services provided to HMRC include maintenance, life cycle replacement, cleaning, help desk, security, catering, childcare, health and safety, utilities, equipment management, churn, vending and landscaping.
The valuations rely upon the Group for its assessment of the cost of providing these services, the level of deductions and how they will vary over time.
An allowance has been applied to the portfolio capital value to account for this obligation to provide services and the nature of the contract.
The valuations have been carried out by taking account of the benefit of the contract with HMRC and the various occupational leases and the subsequent sale of the property at expiry of these arrangements.
In assessing the future sales proceeds, CBRE have estimated the vacant possession yields and have taken into account void periods for marketing and incentives.
Certain other properties held under finance leases and included within property, plant and equipment were valued in accordance with the Red Book by the Directors at a Market Value of 2.1million 2006: 2.2million having taken advice from a suitablyqualied employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
If freehold property and property acquired under finance leases were measured using the historical cost model, the carrying amounts would be as follows: 2007 2006 m m Freehold Cost 183.5 189.8 Accumulated depreciation 3.4 3.5 Net book value 180.1 186.3 Acquired under finance leases Cost 23.7 23.7 Accumulated depreciation 2.6 2.4 Net book value 21.1 21.3 All leased assets are pledged as security for the related finance lease obligation.
As set out in note 17, freehold property and property acquired under finance leases have been secured against external borrowings.

Investment property was valued at 31 December 2007 by CB Richard Ellis Limited CBRE and Knight Frank LLP Knight Frank, valuers external to the Group.
Both Knight Frank and CBRE have consented to the use of their names in these financial statements.
Investment property comprises the Groups Abbey portfolio and its direct property investments.
CBREs valuation of the Abbey portfolio of properties was 556.2million 2006: 575.7million.
Knight Frank and CBRE both carried out valuations of the Groups other properties held within investment property, which were valued at 77.9million 2006: 53.1million, and 918.6million 2006: 850.6million respectively as at 31 December 2007.
At 31 December 2006 the properties valued by Knight Frank were valued by Savills Commercial Limited.
During the period the contract for the valuation of these properties was re-tendered through a competitive process.
The remaining properties held under Property acquired under finance leases were valued by the Directors at a Market Value of 5.3million 2006: 4.2million, having taken advice from a suitably-qualied employee a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
These valuations are summarised below: 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 m m Valuation of Abbey portfolio by CBRE 556.2 575.7 Valuation of asset held for sale by the Directors 2.5 Transfer to non-current assets held for sale 3.0 556.2 575.2 Valuation of direct property investments by Knight Frank 77.9 53.1 Valuation of direct property investments by CBRE 918.6 850.6 Minimum payments under head leases 5.3 4.2 1,558.0 1,483.1 The valuations at 31 December 2007 have been carried out in accordance with The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors' Valuation Standards, Sixth Edition the Red Book.
The valuation as at 31 December 2006 was carried out in accordance with the Fifth Edition.
The valuations have been prepared in accordance with the Red Book on the basis of Market Value, which is set out in note 10.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2007 73 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 11.
Investment property continued The following assumptions were used in determining the valuations which were specic to the Group: The Abbey properties have been valued as part of a portfolio, the Direct Property Investments properties have been valued on an individual basis.
No allowances have been made for any expenses of realisation or for taxation which might arise in the event of a disposal of a property.
The valuations are, however, net of acquisition costs if any.
The valuations have been undertaken assuming that in the case of the Abbey properties, each property is subject to a standard-form lease agreed between the Group and Abbey and that these leases commenced on 1 January 2001 without options to break on the part of either the tenant or the landlord.
There are overriding provisions for Abbey to terminate occupational leases earlier than the original lease-end date.
These are set out within a master agreement entered into with Abbey.
In the case of the DPI properties, the valuation for each of the properties has been undertaken determined by the specic terms of the individual leases.
Abbey's ability to exercise its right to end leases and vacate property early is constrained by the fact that the aggregate rent payable by Abbey in the following years of the master agreement's 20-year term cannot fall below the following percentages of the projected aggregate rents for those years: Years 5 to 6 95% Years 7 to 11 85% Years 12 to 15 80% Years 16 to 20 90% Constraints over the remaining investment properties are determined by the specic term of the individual leases.
In return for the exibility in the Abbey portfolio, there are compensation mechanisms provided within the master agreement which are intended broadly to leave the Group in a neutral position.
Whilst invariably the computation on a property by property basis may result in some properties being under compensated or vice versa, the valuations consider that overall the position is indeed likely to remain neutral.
It should also be noted that the rental increments broadly hold the rental ow at a similar level even on the presupposition that Abbey exercises maximum exibility.
Income and expenditure derived from investment properties relates to the Direct Property Investments Portfolio and also those long leaseholds and freeholds held under the Abbey portfolio as investment property as follows: 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 m m Revenue Revenue from Direct Property Investments Portfolio 69.5 50.3 Revenue from Abbey investment property 43.4 43.0 Total revenues from investment property 112.9 93.3 Property operating expenditure Expenditure from Direct Property Investments Portfolio 4.3 1.5 Expenditure from Abbey investment property 0.2 Total property operating expenditure from investment property 4.5 1.5 Property operating expenditure from investment property that has not generated revenue in the period is 2.2million 2006: 2.1million.

Accruals and deferred income include an amount of 45.0million 2006: 41.6million in respect of deferred income.
Pension costs The Group operates a dened contribution pension scheme.
The pension charge for the year amounted to 0.4million 2006: 0.3million.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The Group does not operate any dened benefit schemes.
Commitments and contingencies Operating lease commitments Group as lessee The Group leases a number of commercial properties under operating leases.
Typically the leases provide for upwards-only rent reviews during the lease term and last 20 years from inception.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Less than one year 162.6 163.1 Between one and five years 525.9 567.0 More than five years 616.7 705.9 1,305.2 1,436.0 Operating lease commitments Group as lessor The Groups portfolio of receivable operating leases comprises a block of leases purchased in December 2000, together with another block of leases, embedded within outsourcing contracts purchased in 2001 which also provide for the supply of other property-related services and some subsequent additions.
These leases are non-cancellable and have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years.
The Groups leases typically include a clause either to enable upward revision of the rental charge on an annual basis based on prevailing market conditions or a xed annual uplift of 3% or RPI and provide for the lessee to pay all insurance, maintenance and repair costs.
Commitments and contingencies continued Operating lease commitments Group as lessor continued Future minimum rentals receivable under other non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December, analysed by the period in which they fall due are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Less than one year 371.5 364.1 Between one and five years 540.9 537.1 More than five years 695.1 763.9 1,607.5 1,665.1 Operating leases embedded in the Groups outsourcing contracts entered into with HMRC provide for exibility for the Government to relinquish space by serving notice of not less than twelve months.
The non-cancellable portion of operating leases therefore only relates to receipts within the next twelve months.
Beyond twelve months the operating leases are cancellable and therefore are not included within the analysis above.
The prior year disclosure above has been adjusted to include the operating lease rentals in respect of the HMRC operating leases as they fall due within less than one year, this amounts to 207.0million.
Total future minimum sub-lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable sub-leases in respect of properties acquired under finance leases at 31 December 2007 were 78.0million 2006: 65.8million.
Where a premium was paid on properties held under operating leases, the premiums are carried at their purchase cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining minimum lease term within premiums on operating leases see note 12.
Capital commitments 2007 2006 m m At 31 December, the Group had the following commitments: Contracted but not provided 0.8 18.1 The capital commitments set out above relate to the commitments under the terms of the contract with HMRC to provide lifecycle works to the buildings within the estate, these are primarily maintenance, refurbishment and replacement works.
Except as disclosed the Group had no further commitments relating to repairs, maintenance or enhancements in respect of investment properties or property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2006 or 2007.
The Group has no commitments to purchase, construct or develop investment property or property, plant and equipment.
Contingent rents Due to the uncertainty of income under the HMRC and Abbey portfolios as a result of the vacation rights that exist within the contracts all contractual revenue under the outsourcing segment is considered to be contingent.
No contingent rents were received under the DPI portfolio during 2007 2006: nil.
No contingent rents were received in respect of finance lease during the year 2006: nil.
Contingent rents expensed during 2007 in respect of operating leases amounted to 0.2million 2006: 1.1million.
Contingent rents expensed during 2007 in respect of finance leases amounted to 0.5million 2006: 0.5million.
Contingent rents represent the difference between current passing rents and those rents anticipated and accrued as rent review dates have passed and is determined through analysis of the movement in rent review accruals.
Financial risk management objectives and policies The Group's principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, finance leases and cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group's property portfolio.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
Derivative financial instruments are used in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements with the principal providers of finance to hedge exposure to uctuations in interest rates.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 2.3.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments through assessment of current interest rates and through monthly valuations of all derivative products.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2007 83 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 23.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling interest rates on long-term borrowings.
To manage this interest rate risk the Group monitors and manages the proportions of xed and variable rate debt.
The Groups policy is to keep 100% of its long-term borrowings at xed rates of interest except for short-term debt raised for the purchase of properties under the Direct Property Investments portfolio.
Properties purchased under this portfolio are initially nanced on a short-term basis before being renanced through long-term borrowing facilities.
A target gearing ratio of up to 80% has been set for these long-term borrowings on direct property investments.
Mapeley also seeks to finance new outsourcing contracts in line with this strategy at up to 80% Loan To Value LTV.
To manage the interest rate exposure on this initial short-term funding the Group enters into interest rate swaps on the date an asset is purchased under which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between xed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount expected to be equivalent to the related long-term borrowings to be used to finance the asset on its renancing.
At 31 December 2007, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, substantially all of the Groups non-current borrowings were at a xed rate of interest.
The following table sets out the drawn down balances of the Groups financial liabilities that are interest bearing and the sensitivity of such liabilities to changes in interest rates: 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 Facility Interest terms m m Term loan under HMRC portfolio facility Fixed rate loan no interest rate risk 173.0 176.0 Term loan under Abbey portfolio facility Variable rate loan 100% effectively hedged no interest rate risk 454.6 455.0 Acquisition term loan Fixed rate loan no interest rate risk 170.9 170.9 Term loan under Beta portfolio facility Fixed rate loan no interest rate risk 208.6 208.6 Term loan under Gamma portfolio facility Fixed rate loan no interest rate risk 231.3 231.3 Revolving Delta acquisition facility Variable rate loan with associated interest rate swaps 257.6 36.5 Overdraft Variable interest rate 0.9 1,496.0 1,279.2 At the end of 2007 the Revolving Delta acquisition facility has swaps totalling 100% of the nominal value and therefore there is no exposure to uctuating interest rates.
Credit risk The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties.
It is the Group's policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verication procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Group's exposure to bad debt is not significant.
The maximum exposure is as disclosed in note 14.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and certain derivative instruments, the Group's exposure to credit risk arises from any default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
In the year ended 31 December 2007, 82% 2006: 86% of the Groups total turnover was derived from contractual payments made to the Group by Government Agencies i. e. HMRC and the Home Ofce, rated AAA by Standard&Poors and Abbey, rated A by Standard&Poors.
Except for these contracts, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and exibility through the use of its overdraft facility.
The Group seeks to limit borrowings maturing within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2007 the Group has a 400.0million 2006: 300.0million revolving acquisition facility to finance the purchase of properties under the Direct Property Investments portfolio which matures in April 2008.
At 31 December 2007 257.6million 2006: 36.4million was drawn under this facility.
The Group has negotiated terms to renance this debt as set out in note 17.
The Group has drawn, long-term secured facilities totalling 1,238.4million 2006: 1,241.6million.
The table below summarises the maturity prole of the Groups financial liabilities as at 31 December based upon contractual undiscounted payments: Less than 3 to 12 1 to 5 On demand 3 months months years 5 years Total m m m m m m Year ended 31 December 2007 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 257.6 454.6 783.8 1,496.0 Interest obligations 21.7 55.6 265.4 212.1 554.8 Swap gains 1.2 1.8 8.4 11.4 Finance lease liabilities 0.2 0.6 3.3 50.2 54.3 Trade and other payables 67.1 1.7 68.8 Year ended 31 December 2006 Interest bearing loans and borrowings 0.2 36.4 1,241.7 1,278.3 Overdrafts 0.9 0.9 Interest obligations 15.9 50.6 262.3 270.2 599.0 Swap losses 0.1 0.4 3.0 0.5 4.0 Finance lease liabilities 0.2 0.6 3.3 51.0 55.1 Trade and other payables 60.5 1.3 61.8 The above analysis is based upon contractual undiscounted payments.
Trade and other payables excludes accruals and deferred income and interest accruals.
Capital Management The Group considers its capital to include longand short-term borrowings and matching derivative financial instruments in addition to all share capital and premium arising from the issuance of its own equity instruments.
The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that the Groups property portfolio is appropriately supported by capital that is efficient and that seeks to reduce uctuations in interest payments due to changes in external interest rates.
The Group manages and makes adjustments to its capital structure through renancing or the issuance of shares in order to maximise the returns to shareholders and to enable growth.
No changes were made to these objectives, policies or processes during the years ending 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2007.
The Group monitors capital compared to this objective through the ratio of hedged debt to total debt and seeks to maintain this ratio as close to 100% as possible as follows: 2007 2006 m m Total debt held at xed interest rates 783.8 786.7 Total debt held with matched interest rate swaps 712.2 475.7 Total hedged debt 1,496.0 1,262.4 Total drawn external loan facilities 1,496.0 1,279.2 Ratio total debt to hedged debt 100.0% 98.7% Total external loan facilities are shown gross of nancing costs.

The Groups criteria for an interest rate swap are that the instrument must be related to an asset or a liability and that it must change the character of the interest rate by converting a oating rate to a xed rate.
Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value and shown on the Group balance sheet at the year-end.
The fair value for a swap is the mid-market value, estimated using a break cost quote from an experienced, independent broker, which is estimated by applying current yields to anticipated future cash ows.
The key assumptions used in the swap valuations are listed below: The valuations represent the Net Present Value of the cash ows from the valuation date until expiry of the instrument at the contracted rate and at the valuation rate: and The valuation rate is compiled from prevailing market futures rates and swap rates on the date of the valuation.
Financial instruments continued Hedging activities Cash ow hedges At 31 December 2007, the Group held four interest-rate swap contracts which have been designated as hedges of oating rate loans with the purpose of reducing the exposure to interest rate risk.
The interest rate contracts have been assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of 2.9million 2006: 23.7million is included in equity.
All movements arising on the revaluation of these swaps are recognised in the income statement.
Mapeley Limited Annual Report 2007 87 Notes to the audited consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 24.
Financial instruments continued Market Risk Interest rate swaps are held at fair value with the fair value being determined with reference to prevailing market futures rates and swap rates on the date of the valuation.
As a result the Group is exposed to market risk in respect of these financial instruments.
Changes in the valuation rates of other interest rate swaps would affect the Groups loss before tax and equity.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in valuation rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on the valuation of the interest rate swaps.

Funds from operations Funds from operations or FFO is a management measure used to demonstrate the underlying operating performance of real estate businesses such as the Company.
It provides investors with information regarding the Groups ability to service debt and make capital expenditure.
FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with IFRS, therefore it should not be considered an alternative to cash ow as a measure of liquidity, and is not necessarily indicative of cash funds available.
This calculation of FFO may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.
The Group defines FFO as Group EBITDA less net finance costs less the movement in the onerous lease provision less the movement in unbilled revenue plus the movement in net asset management receipts plus the charge in respect of employee shares plus realised revaluation gains.
More detailed denitions of these adjustments to EBITDA are given below: Net finance costs comprise finance costs less finance income as set out in the Group income statement, adjusted to exclude amortisation of loan finance fees, gains or losses on interest rate swaps, loan termination costs and the unwinding of discounts on provisions.
The Movement in the onerous lease provision This is the net release or charge to the Group income statement as a result of the change in the Group onerous lease provisions, excluding interest charged on the unwinding of the provision.
Although these amounts offset rental costs in the income statement, they do not represent cash movements and are therefore excluded from the computation of FFO.
The Movement in unbilled revenue is the year on year change in Group accrued revenue.
The amount represents the increase or decrease in life cycle revenue accrued by the Group so as to allocate revenue in the period in which work is performed.
This caption has been renamed from movement in work in progress see note 2.
Net asset management receipts These are the total cash receipts in the year less amounts amortised in the financial period.
The accounting treatment of asset management receipts is set out in the accounting policies.
Employee shares Under IFRS 2, costs are charged to the Group income statement when share based payments are made.
This is a non-cash expense and is therefore excluded from the measure.
Organic FFO is dened as the FFO contribution from property assets or services following the first anniversary of their acquisition or commencement of the contract, net of central overhead costs.
Acquisition FFO is dened as the FFO contribution from property assets or services in the first year of ownership in the case of property assets and contract commencement in the case of new services.
Realised profit on disposal for FFO is dened as the difference between the profit on disposal as per the income statement and the profit in disposal calculated upon the historical cost basis.

Gearing ratio Gearing is dened as Group net debt total debt less cash and short-term deposits as a proportion of total consolidated equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent.
Total debt is dened as actual current and non-current loan balances together with any overdrafts owed to lenders and excludes any finance costs or adjustments to apply the effective interest rate method.
