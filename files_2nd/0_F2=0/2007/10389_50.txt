The fair value of options is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 2007 2006 Share price p 130-193 98-161 Exercise price p 120-191 99-162 Expected volatility % 28-30 28-30 Expected life years 4-6 5-6 Risk-free rate % 4.17-5.12 4.17-5.12 Expected dividends % 1.43-2.29 1.43-2.12 Expected volatility was based upon the historical volatility over the expected life of the schemes.
The expected life is based upon historical data and has been adjusted based on managements best estimates for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds controlled by the scheme providers.
The total cost charged to income of 1.7m 2006: 1.1m represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the schemes.
As at 31 March 2007, contributions of 0.5m 2006: 0.1m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes Group defined benefit schemes The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes called the MITIE Group PLC Pension Scheme and the MITIE Group PLC Passport Pension Scheme.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the Income Statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 0 and 66 per cent of final salary on attainment of a retirement age of 65.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The schemes are funded schemes.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the Group schemes assets and the present value of their defined benefit obligations were carried out at 1 April 2005 by Mr David Higgs, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
Other defined benefit schemes Grouped together under Other schemes are schemes where the Group has allocated sections of two multi-employer schemes in which the Group is a participating employer and several schemes to which the Group makes contributions under Admitted Body status to our customers defined benefit schemes in respect of certain TUPE employees.
These valuations are updated by the actuaries at each balance sheet date.
The present values of the defined benefit obligations, the related current service cost, and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
For the Admitted Body Schemes principally the West Midlands Pension Fund, which are all part of the Local Government Pension Scheme, the Group will only participate for a finite period up to the end of the contracts.
The Group is required to pay regular contributions as decided by the relevant Scheme Actuaries and detailed in the schemes Schedule of Contributions.
In a number of cases contributions payable by the employer are capped and any excess recovered from the body that the employees transferred from.
In addition, in certain cases, at the end of the contract the Group will be required to pay any deficit as determined by the Scheme Actuary that is remaining for its notional section of the scheme.

The expected return on equities is the sum of dividend growth and capital growth net of investment expenses.
The return on gilts and bonds is the current market yield on long-term bonds.
The expected return on property has been set equal to that expected on equities less a margin.
The expected return on other assets is the rate earned by the scheme on cash.
