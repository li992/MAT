The group believes that these returns are maximised when the groups Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is minimised and that this is the case when the group broadly has the characteristics of a BBB rated entity.
The group therefore aims generally to maintain its net debt expressed as a multiple of cash generated from operations within a range corresponding to those of BBB rated entities.
The group has a range of return on capital targets in respect of potential acquisitions, depending upon their size.
Most proposals for bolt-on acquisitions must demonstrate a post-tax return of at least 12% on the capital investment within 3 years.
Medium-sized acquisitions are required to return a minimum of 10% within this timeframe and relatively rare, large, strategic acquisitions a minimum equal to the groups WACC.
The groups calculation of its post-tax WACC at 31 December 2007 was 8.2%.
The group monitors the financial performance of acquired businesses during the years following acquisition against the return targets.
In addition, the group monitors the Return on Net Assets RONA of all its businesses on a monthly basis.
The group regards RONA as a measure of operational performance and therefore calculates it as EBITA divided by net assets excluding goodwill, tax, dividends payable and retirement benefit obligations.
The group has no current intention to commence a share buy-back plan.
The group operates a programme to purchase its own shares on the market on a regular basis so as to provide a pool of shares from which to satisfy share awards to employees as the awards vest.
The group is not subject to externally-imposed capital requirements and there were no changes in the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Liquidity risk The group mitigates liquidity risk by ensuring there are sufficient undrawn committed facilities available to it.
Policy demands a minimum of 20% of such facilities to remain unutilised and in practice the group runs comfortably above this level.
The percentage of available, but undrawn committed facilities during the course of the year was as follows: 31 December 2006 22% 31 March 2007 47% 30 June 2007 41% 30 September 2007 39% 31 December 2007 38% To reduce re-financing risk, Group Treasury obtains finance with a range of maturities and hence minimises the impact of a single material source of finance terminating on a single date.
The groups committed facilities have the following maturity dates: June 2008 30m June 2012 1,087m March 2014 50m March 2017 100m March 2019 73m March 2022 53m 83 33 Financial risk continued Liquidity risk continued Re-financing risk is further reduced by Group Treasury opening negotiations to either replace or extend any major facility at least 18 months before its termination date.
Following the example of the inaugural US Private Placement of loan notes issued in March 2007, the group will continue to seek to diversify its sources of finance and reduce further the proportion of bank supplied finance.
Market risk Currency risk and forward foreign exchange contracts The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is limited since, wherever possible, each business operates and conducts its financing activities in local currency.
However, the group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial proportion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in equity to match translation adjustments on foreign currency equity investments as they qualify as net investment hedges.
The group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge a high proportion of the translation risk not hedged by way of loans.
The group hedges those foreign currencies in which more than 1% of the groups consolidated net operating assets are denominated, provided there is a sufficiently liquid and large enough foreign exchange market in which to hedge the currency.
Other currencies below the 1% threshold will also be considered where the cost of hedging is acceptable.
Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in equity.
The notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2007 was 373.2m 2006: 342.4m.
All these contracts had matured by 29 February 2008, at which point they were replaced with new forward foreign exchange contracts.
All the foreign exchange hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as net investment hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
At 31 December 2007, the groups US dollar, euro, Canadian dollar and Danish krone net assets were approximately 98%, 90%, 93% and 83% respectively hedged by foreign currency loans and foreign exchange forward contracts 2006: US dollar 90.6% and euro 94.7%.
The financial instruments used to hedge the foreign currency translation exposure had a fair value loss of 13.6m at 31 December 2007.
Assuming a 1% depreciation of GBP against each of the hedged currencies, the fair value loss on these instruments would increase by a further 3.9m.
This additional fair value loss would be posted to equity.
A simultaneous depreciation of GBP against all currencies is unlikely based on past market movements.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note 29 exposes the group to cash flow interest rate risk, which the group manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years.
At 31 December 2007 the nominal value of such contracts was 213.5m in respect of US dollar 2006: 196.7m and 183.6m in respect of euro 2006: 141.5m, their weighted average interest rate was 4.9% US dollar 2006: 4.9% and 3.8% euro 2006: 3.4%, and their weighted average period to maturity was three years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of issue in March 2007, the group was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
The core group borrowings are held in USD, euro and GBP.
Although the impact of rising interest rates is partly shielded by interest rate swaps which fix a portion of the exposure, some interest rate risk remains.
Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates across the yield curve in each of these currencies and keeping the 31 December 2007 debt position constant throughout 2008, an additional interest charge of 5.6m would be expected in the 2008 financial year.
Commodity risk and commodity swaps The groups principal commodity risk relates to the fluctuating level of diesel prices, particularly affecting its cash services businesses.
Commodity swaps are sometimes used to fix synthetically part of the exposure and reduce the associated cost volatility.
There were no commodity swaps in place at 31 December 2007.
