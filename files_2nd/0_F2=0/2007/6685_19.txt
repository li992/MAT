20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 66 Notes to the parent company financial statements 1 Parent company accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985 and were approved for issue on 6 September 2007.
They have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
No profit and loss account is presented by the company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the company has taken the exemptions under FRS1 to not present a cash flow statement.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation so as not to provide the information otherwise required by paragraphs 51 to 95 of the standard, as the groups consolidated financial statements, in which the company is included provide equivalent disclosures under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
Changes in accounting policy Property revaluation The company has decided to adopt the revaluation option in FRS15 in relation to the valuation of its land and buildings.
This has been accounted for as a change in accounting policy and the company has restated the results for the prior year to reflect this change in policy.
The company has made this change of accounting policy in accordance with paragraph 55 c of FRS18 Accounting policies as this new policy is more appropriate because it is in line with the policy adopted by the group as well as reflecting the underlying value to the business of property held in the balance sheet of the company.
The impact of this adjustment is set out in note 9, as a result of the change in the accounting policy the carrying value of fixed assets has increased by 73.5m at 2 July 2005 and a further 12.4m at 1 July 2006 with a corresponding increase in the revaluation reserve at that date.
Tangible fixed assets Plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
Land and buildings are recognised initially at cost and thereafter measured at market value less depreciation on buildings and impairment subsequent to the date of valuation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Valuations of land and buildings are performed by either the directors or by a qualified valuer, frequently enough to ensure that the market value of a revalued asset does not differ materially from its carrying amount.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of their expected useful lives and the lease terms.
Depreciation is charged to the profit and loss account based on cost or valuation, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Short leasehold land and buildings The life of the lease Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings over 10 to 100 years Plant and equipment over 3 to 15 years The carrying values of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Any revaluation surplus is credited to the revaluation reserve except where it reverses a decrease in the carrying value of the same asset previously recognised in the profit and loss account, in which case the increase is recognised in the profit and loss account.
A revaluation deficit is recognised in the profit and loss account except to the extent of any existing surplus in respect of that asset in the revaluation reserve.
An annual transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss reserve for the depreciation relating to the revaluation surplus.
Upon disposal any revaluation reserve relating to the particular asset being sold is transferred to retained earnings.
Investments Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Pension benefits The company is a member of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Scheme operated by The Go-Ahead Group plc for the majority of its employees.
This defined benefit scheme is a multi-employer scheme for which individual employer shares of the underlying assets and liabilities cannot be identified and accordingly the company accounts for them as defined contribution schemes.
For the defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other postretirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Share based payments The company has taken advantage of the transitional provision of FRS20 and has applied FRS20 only to these options granted after 7 November 2002.
The cost of options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted, determined by an external valuation using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled options, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of The Go-Ahead Group plc market conditions.
The cost of options is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period from grant to vesting date, being the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award, with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised, at each reporting date, reflects the extent to which the period to vesting has expired and the directors best estimate of the number of options that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
No cost is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
66 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2007 20435 P17 P76 21 9 07 02:29 Page 67 Deferred tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, no timing differences are recognised in respect of: property revaluation surpluses where there is no commitment to sell the asset: gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into replacement assets: deferred tax assets except to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the enacted rates at which it is estimated the tax will be payable.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
Uninsured liabilities The company limits its exposure to the cost of motor, employer and public liability claims through insurance policies issued by third parties.
These provide individual claim cover, subject to high excess limits and an annual aggregate stop loss for total claims within the excess limits.
An accrual is made within current liabilities for the estimated cost to the company to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
On the basis that the company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date, these uninsured liabilities are classified as current.
The estimation of the balance sheet uninsured claims accrual is made after taking appropriate professional advice and is based on an assessment of the expected settlement on known claims, together with an estimate of settlements that will be made in respect of incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date but that have not yet been reported to the company.
Treasury shares Re-acquired shares in the company, which remain uncancelled, are deducted from equity.
Consideration paid and the associated costs are also recognised in shareholders funds as a separate reserve for own shares.
Any gain or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the companys shares is transferred from the reserve for own shares to profit and loss.
Financial assets Financial assets are accounted for in accordance with FRS26.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, being the transaction price plus directly attributable transaction costs.
The company uses energy derivatives to hedge its risks associated with fuel price fluctuations.
Such derivatives are initially recognised at fair value by reference to market values for similar instruments, and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
When the cash flow hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, then at the time that asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of that non-financial asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or otherwise no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point it is taken to the profit and loss account or included in the initial carrying amount of the related non-financial asset as described above.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the profit and loss account.
Leasing commitments Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, and the amortisation of lease incentives and initial direct costs in securing leases, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds, being the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Following initial recognition the carrying amount is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortisation of liabilities and any gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or other derecognition of debt are recognised directly in the profit and loss account.

The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The last formal valuation of the Plan was performed at 5 April 2006 by a professionally qualified actuary.
The next formal valuation is due to be made as at 5 April 2009.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The company has paid contributions to its pension arrangements in line with the contribution schedules in force over the accounting year.
The contributions paid to the defined benefit scheme were 7% and 6% of pensionable salaries to the Upper and Lower tier sections respectively.
Employer contributions to The Go-Ahead Plan are affected by any surplus or deficit in the scheme.
However, as all the participating companies, including the parent company, pay the same net rate of contributions, the actuarial risks are shared and no participating company is able to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Accordingly, the company accounts for its participation in the plan as contributions are payable and provides the following information on the deficit for the scheme as a whole.

13 Share based payments Sharesave Scheme The group operates an HMRC approved savings-related share option scheme, known as The Go-Ahead Group plc Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 2003 the Sharesave Scheme.
The Sharesave Scheme is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the scheme.
Qualifying employees are invited to save between 5 and 75 per month up to a maximum of 250 per month across all schemes for a period of three years.
At the end of that period, employees can apply the amounts saved, together with a bonus, in acquiring shares in the company at a minimum price equal to 80% of their market price at the time of invitation.

The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The key assumptions input into the model used for the options granted in the year to 30 June 2007 were: 2007 2006 % per annum % per annum Future share price volatility 20.0 20.0 Future dividend yield 2.5 2.5 Future risk-free interest rate 5.4 5.4 Forfeiture rate 10.0 10.0 Option life 3 years 3 years The future share price volatility assumption is based on the daily share price movements over the three year period preceding the award date, rounded to the nearest 5%.
Share Incentive Plan The company participates in the group HMRC approved share incentive plan, known as the Go-Ahead Group plc Share Incentive Plan the SIP.
The SIP is open to all group employees including executive directors who have completed at least six months service with a group company at the date they are invited to participate in the plan.
The SIP permits the Go-Ahead Group plc to make four different types of awards to employees free shares, partnership shares, matching shares and dividend shares, although the group has, so far, made award of partnership shares only.
Under these awarded, the group invites qualifying employees to apply between 10 and 125 per month in acquiring shares in the group at the prevailing market price.
Under the terms of the scheme, certain tax advantages are available to the group and employees.
