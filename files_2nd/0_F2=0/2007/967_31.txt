Other information Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates Introduction The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this Annual Report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc Policy for the Reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
This policy requires that the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition the JORC Code be used as a minimum standard.
Some Anglo American plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out in accordance with the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves the SAMREC Code.
The SAMREC Code is similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC 2004 and SAMREC 2007 Codes.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC or SAMREC Codes, which include the Recognised Overseas Professional Organisation ROPO recognition agreements.
All Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking.
All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.
The names of the Competent Persons are lodged with the Anglo American plc Company Secretary and are available on request.
Anglo American Group companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of reviews aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates.
The reviews are conducted by suitably qualified Competent Persons from within a particular division, another division of the Group or from independent consultants.
The frequency and depth of the reviews is a function of the risks and or uncertainties associated with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource, the overall value thereof and time that has lapsed since an independent third party review has been conducted.
Those operations projects subject to independent third party reviews during the year are indicated in footnotes to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions.
These include long-range commodity price forecasts which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long term economic outlooks.
Ore Reserve estimates are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and relevant new information and therefore can vary from year to year.
Mineral Resource estimates also change and tend to be influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the understanding of the deposit and secondly by the conversion to Ore Reserves.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are stated as at 31 December 2007.
Production forecasts for November and December have been used to produce the estimates of the reported reserve figures.
Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional to those resources which have been modified to produce the Ore Reserves.
The figures in the tables have been rounded and, if used to derive totals and averages, could cause minor computational differences.
Ore Reserves in the context of this Annual Report have the same meaning as Mineral Reserves as defined by the SAMREC Code.
Metric units are used throughout the report.
In addition alternative units are also used for Anglo Platinum.
AngloGold Ashanti is not reported as the Groups shareholding has reduced to 16.6% at 31 December 2007, below the internal threshold for reporting.
Details of AngloGold Ashantis 2007 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources can be found on their website.
Highveld and Mondi reported previously as Paper & Packaging are not reported as these businesses have been respectively disposed of and demerged during 2007.
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the Earths crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
The location, quantity, grade, geological characteristics and continuity of a Mineral Resource are known, estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge.
Mineral Resources are sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into Inferred, Indicated and Measured categories.
An Inferred Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence.
It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological and or grade continuity.
It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be limited or of uncertain quality and reliability.
An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence.
It is based on exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are too widely or inappropriately spaced to confirm geological and or grade continuity but are spaced closely enough for continuity to be assumed.
A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which tonnage, densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade and mineral content can be estimated with a high level of confidence.
It is based on detailed and reliable exploration, sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
The locations are spaced closely enough to confirm geological and grade continuity.
An Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured and or Indicated Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined.
Appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out, and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
These assessments demonstrate at the time of reporting that extraction could reasonably be justified.
Ore Reserves are sub-divided in order of increasing confidence into Probable Ore Reserves and Proved Ore Reserves.
A Probable Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated, and in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource.
It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined.
A Proved Ore Reserve is the economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource.
136 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 Other information In South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act, Number 28 of 2002 MPRDA was implemented on 1 May 2004, and effectively transferred custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State.
Mining companies were given up to two years to apply for prospecting permit conversions and five years to apply for mining licence conversions for existing operations.
A Prospecting Right is a new order right that is valid for up to five years, with the possibility of a further extension of three years, that can be obtained either by the conversion of existing old order prospecting permits or through new applications.
An Exploration Right is identical to a Prospecting Right, but is commodity specific in respect of petroleum and gas and is valid for up to three years which can be renewed for a maximum of three periods not exceeding two years each.
A Mining Right is a new order right valid for up to 30 years obtained either by the conversion of an old order mining licence, or as a new order right pursuant to the exercise of the exclusive right of the holder of a new order Prospecting Right, or pursuant to an application for a new Mining Right.
A Production Right is identical to a Mining Right, but is commodity specific in respect of petroleum and gas.
In preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement for South African assets, Anglo American plc has adopted the following reporting principles in respect of Prospecting Rights and Mining Rights: Where applications for new order Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement: Where applications for the conversion of old order mining licences to new order Mining Rights have not yet been submitted and the required deadline typically April 2009 for submission has not passed, the relevant reserves and resources have been included in the statement: Where applications for new order Prospecting Rights have been initially refused by the regulatory authorities, but are the subject of ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities and where Anglo American plc has reasonable expectations that the Prospecting Rights will be granted in due course, the relevant resources have been included in the statement any associated comments appear in the footnotes.
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 | 137 Other information Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 Platinum The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Where relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements e. g. The South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2007.
Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies.
The Mineral Resources are additional to the Ore Reserves.
Merensky and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are reported over an economic and mineable cut appropriate to the specific reef.
The mineable cuts collectively form the basis of the consolidated reef figures.
Details of the individual operations appear in the Anglo Platinum Annual Report.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to Anglo Platinum Limited unless otherwise noted.
Anglo American plcs interest in Anglo Platinum is 76.53%.
2 Grade:4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 M erenskyReef: The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 1.3g t and 4.8g t. The variability is a function of various factors including the depth of the orebody, geological complexity and infrastructure.
4 MerenskyReef: The decrease in the reserve grade is mainly a function of changes occurring at BRPM and Amandelbult.
BRPM changes in the mining method and mine design resulted in a higher stope width and consequent drop in grade.
Amandelbult in-fill drilling revealed increased geological complexity resulting in a drop in the resource grade.
The drop in the resource grade plus a change in the modifying factors resulted in a decrease in the reserve grade.
5 U G2Reef: The reserve pay-limit varies across all operations between 1.3g t and 4.4g t. The variability is a function of various factors including the depth of the orebody, geological complexity and infrastructure.
6 U G2Reef: The increase in reserve tonnage is mainly due to conversion of resources to reserves as a result of Pre-Feasibility studies completed for Rustenburg Section Frank and Turffontein.
7 P latreef:The reserve cut-off is 1.7g t for fresh ore and 3.0g t for weathered oxidised ore. 8 P latreef:A programme of blast-hole drilling indicated higher than expected proportions of oxidised material below the economically recoverable grade.
Approximately half of the tonnage 15Mt was removed as waste and the remainder has been removed from the Ore Reserve due to the change in cut-off grade applied to the oxidised zone.
9 Platreefstockpiles: These are reported separately as Proved Ore Reserves and aggregated into the summation tabulations.
10 Alternativeunits:tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 11 Tailings:These are reported separately as Ore Reserves but are not aggregated in the total Ore Reserve figures.
Operating tailings dams for current mining operations cannot be geologically assessed and therefore are not reported as part of the Ore Reserves.
At Rustenburg and Union Section historical dams have been evaluated and the tailings are included in the Ore Reserves statement.
The following operations and projects were reviewed during 2007 by independent consultants: Amandelbult Section, Lebowa Platinum Mines, PPRust, Rustenburg Section, Union Section, Booysendal Project, Der Brochen Project, BRPM Styldrift, Twickenham Platinum.
2 Grade: 4E PGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 M erenskyandUG2Reefs: Due to the South African Department of Minerals and Energys DME refusal to grant certain Prospecting Right applications and an undertaking by Anglo Platinum Limited not to advance legal proceedings, pending negotiations with the DME and third parties, the following Mineral Resource estimates are not included: Merensky Reef: 161.3Mt @ 5.78g t 30.0Moz, UG2 Reef: 189.5Mt @ 6.00g t 36.5Moz : 94.6% of the above mentioned combined Merensky and UG2 Reef Mineral Resources are in the Inferred Resource category: The 66.5Moz reflects a loss of 8.5% of Anglo Platinums total Mineral Resources.
4 M erenskyReef:Depending on the reef characteristics a 2.5g t to 3.0g t cut-off has been used to identify Mineral Resources.
5 MerenskyReef: Measured and Indicated resource tonnages increased mainly due to in-fill drilling leading to increased confidence in the estimates at the Der Brochen and Booysendal projects.
At Union Section, updated economic assumptions showed that the area below 28 level is currently no longer economically viable and therefore reserve tonnes have been re-allocated to resources.
6 UG2Reef: A 1.8g t cut-off has been used to identify Mineral Resources.
7 UG2Reef: A decrease in the total Measured and Indicated Resource tonnages is mainly as a result of conversion of resources to reserves at Rustenburg Section due to the completion of Pre-Feasibility studies for Frank and Turffontein, and a re-evaluation at Der Brochen due to new information highlighting higher geological complexity.
8 Platreef: A 1.0g t cut-off has been used to identify Mineral Resources.
9 Platreef: In-fill drilling resulted in geological re-interpretation, increased confidence and a consequent increase of Measured Resources.
10 Alternativeunits: tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 11 T ailings: These are reported separately as Mineral Resources but are not aggregated in the total Mineral Resource figures.
Operating tailings dams for current mining operations cannot be geologically assessed and therefore are not reported as part of the Mineral Resources.
At Rustenburg and Union Section historical dams have been evaluated and the tailings are included in the Mineral Resource statement.
2 Grade: 4EPGE is the sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3EPGE is the sum of platinum, palladium and gold grades in grammes per tonne g t. 3 Alternativeunits:tonnage in million short tons Mton and grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t. 4 : Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
A cut-off of US$20.00 gross metal value per tonne was applied.
5 S hebasRidge: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 35% which will be affected once a bankable Feasibility Study has been completed.
A cut-off of US$10.50 per tonne total revenue contribution from the constituent metals was applied.
6 RiverValley: Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
A cut-off of 0.7g t platinum plus palladium was applied.
7 PedraBranca: Anglo Platinum envisages a 51% controlling share in the project.

1 LosBroncesSulphide, Flotation: Updated cut-off grade and final pit design considered in the Los Bronces Development Project and new economic assumptions.
2 ElSoldadoOxide, HeapLeach: As a result of exploration new Oxide Ore Reserves have been included in this statement.
3 MantosBlancosOxide, VatandHeapLeach: Gains in Ore Reserves related mainly to old workings recognised during 2007 and new economic parameters which define a lower cut-off grade.
4 Collahuasi:Unlike Xstrata Collahuasi joint venture partner, Anglo American reports Mineral Resources in excess of those that have been converted to Ore Reserves and only those Inferred Resources that are in the Life of Mine plan.
5 CollahuasiOxide, : Heap Leach ore includes secondary sulphide ore from Ujina Mine.
6 CollahuasiSulphide, Flotation: Gains in Ore Reserves related mainly to new economic parameters, which define a lower cut-off grade, and new Mineral Resources added in Rosario Oeste due to a brownfields exploration programme.
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operations were reviewed during 2007 by independent consultants: Los Bronces, Mantos Blancos, El Soldado, Mantoverde.
For the polymetallic deposits, the tonnage figures apply to each metal.
1 BlackMountain: On 18 January 2007, Exxaro exercised its option to acquire a 26% interest in Black Mountain.
The sale is contingent on the conversion of old order to new order mining rights.
It is expected that this will take place in 2008.
2 BlackMountainDeeps:A new 3D model has been built and the classification criteria changed along with new economic factors being applied.
Ore Reserves include 8,745kt of silver ore at 55g t as a by-product.
3 Lisheen:Decrease due to losses on the margins of the orebodies in Main East, Main West and oolite zones following mining and new underground drilling information.
The Ore Reserves of the following operations were reviewed during 2007 by independent consultants: Lisheen.
4 BlackMountainDeeps: Broken Hill and the Deeps Mineral Resources are combined for reporting purposes.
An updated 3D model based on additional information obtained from underground in-fill drilling was completed during 2007.
The improved understanding of the orebody led to the introduction of a scorecard classification methodology and Mineral Resources based on surface drilling only are classified as Inferred Resources.
Mineral Resources contain 8,175kt of silver ore at 40g t as a by-product.
5 B : The Swartberg mine was placed on care and maintenance from January 2007.
The Ore Reserves were removed from the mine plan and converted to Mineral Resources.
Mineral Resources contain 17,323kt of silver ore at 35g t as a by-product.
The Mineral Resources of the following operations were reviewed during 2007 by independent consultants: Lisheen.
1 BarroAlto: The mineral resource model was updated and the mining design optimised to incorporate the new resources into the Ore Reserves.
Ore from Barro Alto is currently being processed at the Codemin plant.
2 LomadeNquel: Increases are due to changes to the geological model incorporating new drilling information.
Refer to note 38 of the Financial statements for further information regarding the nickel exploration and exploitation concessions held.

1 NamakwaSands:On 18 January 2007, Exxaro exercised its option to acquire a 100% interest of Namakwa Sands.
Change due to production and resource model update during 2007.
1 Quellaveco: Based on a feasibility study completed in 2000.
2 Gamsberg: Based on a feasibility study completed in 2000 and reviewed in 2006 to account for prevailing economic and financial assumptions.
The Mine Plan includes an additional 54,200kt at 4.10% Zn of Inferred Mineral Resources.
3 Pebble: Copper Equivalent CuEq calculations use metal prices of $1.00 lb for copper, $400 oz for gold and $6.00 lb for molybdenum.
The CuEq used for the tabulated resources does not include estimates of metallurgical recoveries.
Should provisional metallurgical recoveries be included in the CuEq calculation, an indication of the impact on the resource estimates is shown in the footnotes.
It must be emphasised that metallurgical test work is ongoing at both Pebble East and Pebble West and that reliable estimates of recoveries will only be established during the current pre-feasibility study which is due for completion at end 2008.
By definition mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability.
Due to the uncertainty in the estimates of Inferred Resources, it should not be assumed that all of the Inferred Resources will necessarily upgrade to Indicated or Measured Resources.
4 PebbleEast: The resources are based on drilling to November 2007 and a block model created in December 2007.
A cut-off grade of 0.8% CuEq was used and is considered reasonable for a large-scale underground operation.
The resources occur in a reasonably coherent volume but a more detailed underground design was not undertaken to constrain the resources or to test for reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
At a cut-off of 1% CuEq the estimates of resources are 1,500Mt at 0.82% Cu, 0.49g t Au and 0.035% Mo 1.32% CuEq.
If the estimates of recovery are used in the CuEq calculation, the estimate of Inferred Resources above a cut-off of 0.8% CuEq drops to 2,100Mt at 0.75% Cu, 0.43g t Au and 0.035% Mo.
6 P ebbleWest: The resource block model used as the basis for reporting is unchanged from that used by Northern Dynasty Mines to previously publish resources.
The resources in the table are based on a cut-off grade of 0.4% CuEq.
Reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction for the Pebble West Measured and Indicated Resources is satisfied in that more than 96% of the resources fall within a pit generated using Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources.
At a cut-off of 0.5% CuEq the estimates of Measured plus Indicated Resources are 1,630Mt at 0.35% Cu, 0.39g t Au and 0.018% Mo 0.69% CuEq.
If the estimates of recovery are used in the CuEq calculation, the estimates of Measured plus Indicated Resources above a cut-off of 0.4% CuEq drops to 1,920Mt at 0.34% Cu, 0.37g t Au and 0.017% Mo.

The Mineral Resources are reported as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve figures, i. e. the Ore Reserves are included in the Mineral Resource figures.
The tonnage is quoted as metric tonnes and abbreviated as Mt for million tonnes.
150 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 Other information 1 SishenIronOreMine: New economic assumptions and revised Optimistic Pit shell applied.
2 : New economic assumptions and revised Optimistic Pit shell applied.
3 S : The process of converting Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves is time-consuming and as the geological model update was only completed late in 2007, the Ore Reserves reported are based on previous geological models.
Globally the Mineral Resource estimates between the two models are similar with local variations which could impact the Ore Reserve estimates when updated in 2008.
Updated economic assumptions and a change in the long term outlook on exploitation of these resources resulted in the underground option no longer being considered.

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 | 151 Other information Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates continued for the year ended 31 December 2007 Ferrous Metals continued Minas-Rio Project The Minas-Rio Project is located in the Minas Gerais state of Brazil and will include open pit mines and a beneficiation plant producing high grade pellet feed which will be transported, through a slurry pipeline, over 500 km to the Port of Au in the Rio fide Janeiro state.
The project will largely be based on the two main deposits of Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga while smaller deposits occur at Serro and Joo Monlevade.
Two ore types, Friable and Hard Itabirite, have been identified at Serra do Sapo and Itapanhoacanga.
Only the Friable Itabirite at Serra do Sapo is being considered for Phase 1 of the project.
The planned annual capacity of Phase 1 is 26.5 Mtpa of iron ore pellet feed wet tonnes, for start-up during 2010.
The estimates of Mineral Resources have been audited by an independent Qualified Person from SRK who has compiled a NI 43-101 compliant Technical Report for MMX.
The Mineral Resources are also JORC compliant.
The Qualified Person has consented to the inclusion of the resources in the table below, and associated footnotes, and agrees with the context and form in which they occur.

1 Minas-RioProject: All Mineral Resources are stated as wet tonnes and the moisture content is estimated at 7%.
2 : Due to the uncertainty in the estimates of Inferred Resources, it should not be assumed that all of the Inferred Resources will necessarily upgrade to Indicated or Measured Resources.
3 S erradoSapo: Drilling has taken place over less than 50% of the strike length of the deposit and further exploration is expected to yield between 800Mt and 1000Mt of additional Friable Itabirite resources.
It must be emphasised that this potential quantity is conceptual in nature, that there is insufficient exploration to define a Mineral Resource and that it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the determination of a Mineral Resource.

152 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 Other information Samancor The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with The SAMREC Code, 2007 and The JORC Code, 2004 as applicable.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
Mamatwan tonnages stated as Wet Metric Tonnes.
Wessels and GEMCO tonnages stated as Dry Metric Tonnes.
1 MamatwanOreReserves: The final slope angle of the boundary pillar and safety factors have been reviewed and the X zone included.
2 WesselsOreReserves: Positive changes in market conditions has allowed for the downward adjustment of the cut-off grade to 37.5% Mn as opposed to 43.6% Mn used in 2006.
The mean grade of the high grade product W1L was also adjusted to 47% Mn from a traditional mean grade of 48% Mn.
3 G EMCOOreReserves: Changes are primarily due to enhanced market conditions and the inclusion of J Deposit.
The Ore Reserves reported are stated with total tonnage but report the grade values only above the nominated cut-off of 40% Mn product grade.
The grade is reported using beneficiated grades, as beneficiated grades are used in mine scheduling, quality control and blending rather than in situ grades.
4 : Additional boreholes resulted in an enhanced geological model and along with changes to the classification criteria, have enabled upgrading of additional resources to Measured and Indicated Resources.
5 W : Changes are due to a revised structural interpretation and geological model along with the inclusion of all material above a revised cut-off of 37.5% Mn.
The downward adjustment of the cut-off from the previous 43.5% Mn is due to positive changes in market conditions.
6 G EMCOMineralResources: Additional drillholes and in-fill drilling has resulted in re-classification of ground increasing the Measured Resources significantly.

156 | Anglo American plc Annual Report 2007 Other information Reserves  -10% atreportinglevel : Increase in Coal Reserves by 16Mt 100% brought about by the acquisition of Peace River Coal Anglo Americans interest in Peace River Coal is 65.9%.
: Decrease in Coal Reserves by 3Mt -47% brought about principally by the transfer out of 2Mt of Coal Reserves at Bank 5 Colliery due to the closure of the mine for economic reasons.
: The increase in reserves of 53Mt 7% is due primarily to the conversion of Maccauvlei West Mine Lease Coal Resources to 103Mt of Coal Reserves at New Vaal 14%.
 In 2007 Anglo Coal created a black economic empowerment BEE company, Anglo Inyosi Coal, into which it is transferring certain of its South African assets.
A total of 27% of these transferred assets will be disposed of to BEE partners and the differences in the attributable ownership percentage between the 2006 and 2007 reporting periods reflect this change in ownership within Anglo Coal in the South African Domestic Power Generation Coal Reserves.
This change does not impact on the reportable reserves, but reduces the attributable Coal Reserves of Kriel Colliery to 73% a reduction of 42Mt.
 Venezuela: Although the Carbones del Guasare mining concession terminates in 2013, life of mine Coal Reserves extending beyond this date are included in the 2007 Reserve statement.
SouthAfrica: Where applications for Mining Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant Coal Reserves have been included in the statement.
Where applications for the conversion of old order mining licences to new order Mining Rights have not yet been submitted these have been included in the statement, as the deadline for submission is typically April 2009.
Resources  -10% atreportinglevel MineLeaseResources : Increase in Coal Resources by 3Mt 100% brought about by the acquisition of Peace River Coal.
: Decrease in Coal Resources by 24Mt -95% brought about by the transfer out of Mine Lease Coal Resources at Bank 5 Colliery due to the closure of the mine for economic reasons.
: The increase in Coal Resources of 28Mt 145% is due mainly to the acquisition of a 23.3% interest in Jellinbah Colliery.
Although Jellinbah was acquired in 2002, it was not previously reported since a JORC compliant resource and reserve statement was only completed during 2007.
: The increase in Coal Resources of 136Mt 34% is brought about principally by the transfer of Project Resources to Mine Lease Resources at Zondagsfontein Colliery 174Mt.
: The decrease in resources of 82Mt -31% is due primarily to the conversion of 100Mt of Maccauvlei West Mine Lease Resources to Reserves at New Vaal.
ProjectResources SouthAfrica: The net decrease of 134Mt -8% was brought about principally by the transfer of Zondagsfontein Project Resources to Zondagsfontein Colliery Mine Lease Resources.
AustraliaBrownCoal: Monash Energy brown coal resources increased by 3,840Mt 59% due to a revised resource evaluation model refinement during 2007.
A total of 27% of these transferred assets will be disposed of to BEE partners.
The differences in the attributable ownership percentage between the 2006 and 2007 reporting periods reflect this change in ownership within Anglo Coal in the South African Domestic Power Generation Mine Lease Coal Resources and in the South African Project Coal Resources.
This change does not impact on the reportable resources, but reduces the attributable Mine Lease Resources of Kriel and Zondagsfontein Collieries to 73% a reduction of 73Mt.
Likewise, the Project Resources of the South Rand, Elders, New Largo, Oogiesfontein and Zondagsfontein projects are reduced to 73% a reduction of 357Mt.
 Venezuela: Although the Carbones del Guasare mining concession terminates in 2013, Mine Lease Coal Resources that may be included in a mine plan beyond this date are included in the 2007 Resource statement.
SouthAfrica: Where applications for Mining Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant Mine Lease Coal Resources have been included in the statement.
Where applications for Prospecting Rights have been submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory authorities, the relevant Project Coal Resources have been included in the statement.
Where applications for Prospecting Rights have been initially refused by the regulatory authorities, most of these rights have now been granted and the remaining three refused applications are still the subject of ongoing legal review and Anglo Coal has reasonable expectations that the Prospecting Rights will be granted in due course, the relevant Project Coal Resources have been included in the statement.
As at 31 December 2007, a total of 40.1Mt of the reported Project Coal Resources were associated with two applications for new order Prospecting Rights that have been initially refused and are now the subject of ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities.
Consistent with the principles adopted in the reporting of Project Coal Resources in South Africa previously, Anglo Coal currently expects that the outcome of such review and discussions will be favourable.
An application for New Order Mining Rights was submitted for Zondagsfontein Colliery during 2007.
