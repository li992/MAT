Income represents dividends received inclusive of overseas withholding tax and gross interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2007.
Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited accounts of the investee business, and are the net assets of each business and the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax respectively.
