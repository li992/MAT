c Deferred income tax The deferred income tax assets included in the balance sheet is as follows: Group 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax assets: Decelerated capital allowances 936 884 Tax losses available for offset against future tax 199 755 Share-based payments 2,805 469 Open positions valuation at bid or offer - 379 Employees short-term compensated absences - 24 3,940 2,511 The tax losses available for offset against future tax relate to operating losses arising in overseas subsidiary companies, the recoverability of which is dependent on future operating profits in that entity.
A deferred tax asset is recognised where it is anticipated that future operating profits will exceed the losses that have arisen to date.
Where it is not anticipated that future operating profits will exceed the losses that have arisen to date a deferred tax asset is not recognised.
At the balance sheet date deferred tax assets of 153,418 2006 nil were not recognised because of uncertainty over the recoverability of tax losses against future operating profits.
Share-based payment awards have been charged to the income statement but are not allowable as a tax expense until the awards vest.
The excess of tax relief in future periods over the amount charged to the income statement is recognised as a credit directly to equity.
The open positions valuation at bid or offer and the employees short-term compensated absences both arose because of the Groups transition to IFRS in the year ended 31 May 2006.
IFRS was not adopted in the financial statements of the individual entities within the Group and a deferred tax asset arose as a result of differences in the recognition of taxable items of income and expenditure between the Group financial statements and those of the individual entities.
During the year ended 31 May 2007, all Group companies adopted IFRS in their financial statements and as a result the deferred tax asset relating to transitional adjustments reversed in the Group financial statements.
