FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 174 ASTRAZENECA ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F INFORMATION 2007 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 27 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED Taxation Where tax exposures can be quantified, an accrual is made based on best estimates and managements judgement.
Details of the movements in relation to material tax exposures are discussed below.
AstraZeneca faces a number of transfer pricing audits in jurisdictions around the world and, in some cases, is in dispute with the tax authorities.
The issues under discussion are often complex and can require many years to resolve.
Accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgements with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit, and actual results could vary from these estimates.
The international tax environment presents increasingly challenging dynamics for the resolution of transfer pricing disputes.
These disputes usually result in taxable profits being increased in one territory and correspondingly decreased in another.
Our balance sheet positions for these matters reflect appropriate corresponding relief in the territories affected.
Management considers that at present such corresponding relief will be available but given the challenges in the international tax environment will keep this aspect under careful review.
The total net accrual included in the Financial Statements to cover the worldwide exposure to transfer pricing audits is $1,322m, an increase of $327m due to a number of new audits, revisions of estimates relating to existing audits, offset by a number of negotiated settlements.
For transfer pricing audits where AstraZeneca and the tax authorities are in dispute, AstraZeneca estimates the potential for reasonably possible additional losses above and beyond the amount provided to be up to $400m: however, management believes that it is unlikely that these additional losses will arise.
Of the remaining tax exposures, AstraZeneca does not expect material additional losses.
It is not possible to estimate the timing of tax cash flows in relation to each outcome, however, it is anticipated that a number of significant disputes may be resolved over the next one to two years.
Included in the provision is an amount of interest of $234m.
Interest is accrued as a tax expense.
