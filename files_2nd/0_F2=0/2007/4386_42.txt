Accordingly, on CPRMs recommendation, the following profile was used which is consistent with their wider actuarial experience of actual member exercise rates but still aligned with the specific history for the Dana Scheme.
Profit Trigger 25% 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% No Trigger % Exercising 15 25 25 15 10 5 5 The staff turnover assumption is based on the Companys historic rate of staff turnover amongst all share option holders.
This was established from factual historic data at 8% pa. Mortality prior to expiry was assumed to be nil.
The fair value of the Phantom cash-settled options was established in exactly the same way, and until the liability is ultimately settled, it is required to be remeasured at each reporting date, with changes to fair value recognised in the income statement.
Deferred Share Payments A and B The extent, nature and general terms and conditions of these awards to Mr T P Cross are detailed in the Report of the Directors on page 41.
The shares granted under these arrangements are subject to a five year holding period restriction, or until the termination of the employment contract of Mr T P Cross.
The fair value of these awards are being amortised over a five year vesting period.
The carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options at 31 December 2007 is 2,775,000 2006: 3,217,000.
The expense recognised for the share based payments above in respect of employee services during the year to 31 December 2007 is 2,522,000 2006: 3,110,000.
The portion of that expense arising from equity-settled share based payment transactions is 981,000 2006: 192,000.
