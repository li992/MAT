ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following paragraphs summarise the more important accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accounts.
Basis of accounting The accounts of the company are prepared under the historical cost convention in compliance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards Financial Reporting Standards FRS, Statements of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP and Urgent Issues Task Force abstracts UITF and, except where otherwise stated in the notes to the accounts, with the Companies Act 1985.
Explanations of the departures from the requirements of the Act in respect of grants and contributions and the divisionalisation of subsidiary undertakings are given in the related policies below.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below remain most appropriate to the companys circumstances, have been consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and prudent estimates and judgements.
The financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis as the immediate holding company has agreed that that it will continue to provide financial support to this company to enable it to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
The financial statements contain information about Yorkshire Water Services Ltd as an individual company and do not contain consolidated financial information as the parent of a group.
The Company is exempt under S228A of the Companies Act 1985 from the requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements as it and its subsidiary undertakings are included by full consolidation in the consolidated financial statements of its parent, Kelda Group plc, a company registered in England and Wales.
Turnover Turnover comprises charges to customers for water, sewerage and other services excluding value added tax and is derived only from the United Kingdom.
Turnover is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer.
Turnover relates to charges due in the year, excluding any amounts paid in advance.
Turnover for measured water charges includes amounts billed plus as estimation of the amounts unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon daily average water consumption, which is calculated based upon historical billing information.
Pensions The companys employees participate in the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP, a group defined benefit scheme as described in note 22 of the financial statements.
The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the scheme as if they were defined contribution schemes.
The company has early adopted the amendment to FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
This has no impact on the profit and loss account or balance sheet but brings disclosures in line with those in the group accounts.
Share based payments The ultimate parent undertaking, Kelda Group plc, company operates a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to employees of the company.
The fair value of the options granted in exchange for employee services rendered is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account with a corresponding credit to equity.
The total amount which is expensed over the vesting period is determined by the fair value of the option at the date of grant.
The fair value of the option calculated is determined by use of mathematical modelling including the Black Scholes option pricing model.
18 Notes to the Accounts The company reassesses its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable at each balance sheet date.
Any adjustments to the original estimates are recognised in the profit and loss account and equity.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIPs have 2 separate vesting conditions, both of which are dependent on market-based conditions Kelda shareholder return against a comparator group and against the market.
The market-based conditions of the award are taken into account in valuing the award at the grant date.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the company revises its estimate of the number of employees who will receive awards.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
For both share options and LTIPs the corresponding entries to equity represent capital contributions from the parent company.
When the amounts are recharged by the parent, a corresponding entry to reserves is recorded.
The provisions of FRS20 have been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002 and not vested before 1 January 2005.
Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account in the financial year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on fixed assets relating to research and development projects is written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
Taxation The taxation charge in the profit and loss account is based on the profit for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non-taxable items using current rates and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, subject to the following: - provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets.
- deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that tax will arise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Investments Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are any indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business or an associate over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its economic useful life, which normally will not exceed 20 years.
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition 19 Notes to the Accounts and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on the transfer of the trade and net assets of The York Waterworks Ltd is being amortised over a 19 year period.
The net book amount of 11.3m is shown under intangible assets in the balance sheet at 31 March 2007.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets comprised the following:- Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sea outfalls.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets to increase capacity or enhance the network and to maintain the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service is treated as a fixed asset addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network based on an independently certified asset management plan.
Other tangible fixed assets Other tangible fixed assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Finance costs incurred in respect of the construction of other tangible fixed assets are not capitalised.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on other tangible fixed assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual major components, from the month following commissioning.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows:- Buildings 25 - 60 years Fixed plant 5 - 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 - 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leased assets Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised in tangible fixed assets and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in borrowings.
Depreciation is generally charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
If the operational life of an asset is longer than the lease term, and the agreement allows an extension to that term, the asset may be depreciated over its operational life.
The capital element of lease payments reduces the obligation to the lessor and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are operating leases and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straightline basis over the term of the lease.
Grants and contributions Grants and contributions in respect of tangible assets, other than infrastructure assets as described below, are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected economic useful lives of the related assets.
20 Notes to the Accounts Grants and contributions in respect of expenditure enhancing the infrastructure network are applied in reducing that expenditure.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
The presentation is adopted because infrastructure assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore such grants and contributions would remain as liabilities in perpetuity.
The directors consider that the company's presentation shows a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
The effect on the companys balance sheet of this departure is to decrease the net book value of tangible fixed assets by 327.5m 2005: 303.2m.
Grants and contributions received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
Stocks Stocks are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Foreign currencies Individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on both individual currency transactions settled during the year and unsettled monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Provisions Provision is made in accordance with FRS 12 for self insured claims, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported.
Financial instruments Trade debtors and creditors Trade debtors do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated recoverable amounts.
There is no intention to trade the debtors.
Trade creditors are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the company's exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings.
The amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis through adjustments to the interest expense of the corresponding liability.
Divisionalisation of subsidiary undertakings As the Instrument of Appointment of The York Waterworks Ltd was merged with that of Yorkshire Water Services Ltd on 1 April 2000, its trade and net assets were transferred to the company at their net book value, which was less than their fair value.
As a result of the transfer, the value of the companys investment in that subsidiary undertaking fell below the amount at which it was stated in the companys accounting records.
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the companys profit and loss account.
However, the directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Group, this would fail to give a true and fair view.
The difference should instead be reallocated to goodwill at the time of the asset transfer, so as to recognise in the companys individual balance sheet the effective cost to the company of those net assets and goodwill.
The effect on the companys balance sheet of this departure is to recognise goodwill of 11.3m 2006: 12.3m, net of amortisation of 6.6m 2006: 5.6m.
The Group accounts are not affected by this transfer.

The company expects to be able to continue to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
- changes in the medium and long-term interest rates used to discount deferred tax assets and liabilities will affect the amount of deferred tax charged in the profit and loss account.
The 2007 budget also introduced a number of factors that may also impact the tax charge in future periods: - a change in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% from 1 April 2008.
- a change in the rate of capital allowances.
The impact of the above changes cannot be reasonably assessed by the company.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES The banking arrangements of the company operate on a pooled basis with other group companies and the bank balances of each subsidiary can be offset against each other.
The company has guaranteed bonds at 6 7 8% due 2010 and 6.625% due 2031 issued by the parent company.
The liabilities under these guarantees amounted to 200m and 240m respectively at 31 March 2007.
The company has guaranteed bonds at 5.375% due 2023, 3.048% due 2033 index linked, 1.462% due 2051 index linked and 1.46% due 2056 index linked issued by the subsidiary company Yorkshire Water Services Finance Plc.
The liabilities under these guarantees amounted to 200m, 112m after inflation is added to the principal of 100m, 128m after inflation is added to the principal of 125m and 128m after inflation is added to the principal of 125m respectively at 31 March 2007.
PENSIONS The group sponsors a UK pension scheme called the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP.
The KGPP has a number of benefit categories providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and one category providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
Contributions over the year ended 31 March 2007 were paid by members at 3%, 4%, 4.5% or 6% of pensionable pay depending on benefit category.
The company contributed at 475% of members contributions during the accounting year in respect of the majority of members.
Part of this contribution for the current accounting year was paid in advance in March 2006.
The company also made a special contribution of 47m on 29 March 2007.
34 Notes to the Accounts The most recent actuarial valuation of the KGPP was carried out as at 31 March 2004 when the market value of assets was 500.0m.
Yorkshire Water Services Ltd is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the KGPP and therefore accounts for pension costs on a contribution basis.
The companys total pension charge for the year was 60.7m, which includes a special contribution of 47m disclosed as an exceptional operating charge see note 2.
Excluding the exceptional operating pension charge of 47m, the companys normal operating pension charge was 13.7m 2006: 13.9m.

The fair value of the share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes statistical model.
The inputs to the Black Scholes model are as follows: 2007 2006 Share price at date of grant 926p 735p Exercise price 741p 588p Expected volatility 25% 25% Expected life 3 and 5 years 3 and 5 years Risk free rate 5.08% 4.56% Expected dividends 31p 30p Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the groups share price over the previous 6 years.
Long term incentive plan LTIP Awards under the LTIP have 2 separate vesting conditions, both of which are dependent on market-based conditions.
The market-based conditions of the award are taken into account in valuing the award at the grant date by applying the probability that the LTIPs will vest to the current market price of the groups shares.
At each subsequent balance sheet date the group revises its estimate of the number of employees who will receive awards.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
37 Notes to the Accounts 70% of the full value of the LTIPs will vest based on the companys total shareholder return TSR performance over the performance period 3 years.
The groups share performance will be compared with reference to the 6 listed water companies.
At the end of the performance period the TSR of all 7 companies will be calculated, and the results ranked.
Full vesting will require top ranking and, if Kelda is ranked between median and top position, between 30% and 100% of the shares will vest depending on how close Keldas TSR is to the first and fourth companies.
For the remaining 30%, the groups TSR will be compared to the constituents of the FTSE 350 index.
No shares will vest unless Kelda is ranked at least median.
30% vest at median and 100% will vest if Kelda is in the top 20% of companies, with pro-rata vestings based on ranking position for intermediate performance.
