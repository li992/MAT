The Group has allocated its goodwill across approximately 20 cashgenerating units.
Other than the goodwill allocated to the US operations within the Land & Armaments business group acquired as part of the acquisition of United Defense Industries, Inc. in 2005 1,984m and Armor Holdings, Inc. in 2007 1,554m, none of the cash-generating units has allocated goodwill exceeding 10% of the Groups total goodwill balance.
The Groups approach to goodwill impairment testing is set out in the accounting policies on page 94.
All significant goodwill balances have been considered with regard to value in use calculations.
The key assumption underpinning the Integrated Business Plan projections for the US operations within the Land & Armaments business group is that US government defence spending will remain broadly stable in the foreseeable future.
The directors have not identified any reasonable possible changes in key assumptions for this business that would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
Beyond the assumptions that US and UK government defence spending remains stable there are no individually significant assumptions made in relation to the other cash-generating units where changes to key assumptions would cause the carrying value of recognised goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.
The result of the review of the carrying value of goodwill across the Group is an impairment charge of 148m 2006 32m.
The majority of the impairment charge relates to the Insyte business within Programmes & Support reflecting lower exports and Homeland Security activity.

The US$1bn 6.4% bond, repayable 2011 has been partially converted to a floating rate bond by utilising a series of interest rate swaps with different tenors: US$500m has been swapped until maturity of the bond in 2011 and US$250m was swapped until December 2007.
This has been overlayed by US$300m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps that fix the interest payments at a lower rate than the original coupon.
The effective interest rate during 2007 was 6.49% with an interest rate split on the bond at 31 December 2007 being US$800m fixed and US$200m floating.
The Class B and Class G certificates are repayable in 2011 and 2013 respectively with fixed US$ coupon rates of 7.156% and 6.664%, giving a weighted average interest rate of 6.879%.
At 31 December 2007, the gross outstanding principal due is US$1,138m.
Of this balance, US$348m has been converted to a sterling floating rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap which resulted in an effective interest rate during 2007 of 6.75% on this element.
The US$500m 7.5% bond, repayable 2027 was converted at issue to a sterling fixed rate bond by utilising a cross-currency swap and has an effective interest rate of 7.73%.

Retirement benefit obligations Pension plans BAE Systems plc operates pension plans for the Groups qualifying employees in the UK, US and other countries.
The principal plans in the UK and US are funded defined benefit plans and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans in other countries are unfunded or defined contribution plans.
Pension plan valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding and to calculate the IAS 19 deficit.
The disclosures below relate to post-retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and other countries which are accounted for as defined benefit plans in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations used for the IAS 19 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the deficit of the plans at 31 December each year.
Plan assets are shown at the bid value at 31 December each year.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
The latest valuations of the principal plans, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2007.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension plans.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the principal plans were: UK US 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 % % % % % % Inflation rate 3.3 3.0 2.8 3.0 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 4.0 3.8 5.8 5.8 5.8 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.3 3.3 2.9 3.0 2.6 2.8 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 3.3 3.0 2.8 n a n a n a Discount rate 5.8 5.2 4.8 6.5 5.9 5.8 Long-term healthcare cost increases n a n a n a 5.4 5.5 5.6 The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The bid value of plan assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of plan liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December are shown in the tables below.
For its UK pension arrangements the Group has, for the purpose of calculating its liabilities as at 31 December 2007, used PA 00 2006 PA 92 medium cohort tables based on year of birth as published by the Institute of Actuaries for both pensioner and non-pensioner members in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the actual mortality experience of plan members.
For its US pension arrangements the mortality tables used for pensioners and non-pensioners are RP 2000 projected to 2010.
The current life expectancies underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the main UK and US plans range from 18 to 22 years for current male pensioners at age 65 and 21 to 25 years for current female pensioners at age 65.
The Group has a number of healthcare arrangements in the US.
The long-term healthcare cost increases shown in the table above are based on the assumptions that the increases are 10% in 2007 reducing to 5% by 2015 for pre-retirement and 10% in 2007 reducing to 5% for post-retirement.
A summary of the movements in the retirement benefit obligations is shown below.

As these plans are multi-employer plans the Group has allocated an appropriate share of the IAS 19 pension deficit to the equity accounted investments and to Airbus SAS based upon a reasonable and consistent allocation method intended to reflect a reasonable approximation of their share of the deficit.
The Groups share of the IAS 19 pension deficit allocated to the equity accounted investments is included in the balance sheet within equity accounted investments.

This is consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over time.
Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated before expected return assumptions are determined for each asset class.
The overall expected return is established with proper consideration of diversification and rebalancing.
Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonableness and appropriateness.

The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases and associated future minimum sublease income are as follows: 2007 2006 Payments due: m m Not later than one year 125 121 Later than one year and not later than five years 460 393 Later than five years 731 731 1,316 1,245 Total of future minimum sublease income under non-cancellable subleases 249 212 Capital commitments Capital expenditure contracted for but not provided for in the accounts is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Property, plant and equipment 121 133 Intangible assets 6 5 127 138 Treasury contingent liabilities Treasury contingent liabilities are set out in note 32.
Other contingent liabilities The Group is subject to an ongoing investigation by the UK Serious Fraud Office the SFO in connection with marketing of the Groups products.
The Group is co-operating fully with the SFO.
At this stage management cannot determine whether or not it might lead to any proceedings being brought against the Group.
Accordingly, the potential for fines or other penalties cannot currently be assessed, although the directors continue to consider that the Group has not acted unlawfully in relation to any of the matters under investigation.
As the investigation is ongoing it is not possible to identify the timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
In addition, in June 2007, the US Department of Justice notified the Group that it had commenced a formal investigation relating to the Groups compliance with anti-corruption laws, including its business concerning the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Again, given the status of this matter it is not possible to provide any details of any possible future financial effects that might result from the investigation and any subsequent actions or events that might occur as a result of the investigation.
Equally it is not possible to provide any timescale in which these issues might be resolved.
The directors continue to consider that the Group has not acted unlawfully in relation to its dealings with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia or in relation to anti-corruption laws.
Should any financial effects arise as a result of these investigations the directors consider it unlikely that there is any likelihood of reimbursement for such costs from any sources other than certain rights to recover reimbursement of the legal costs under the Group's insurance policies.

Certain parts of the Companys Articles of Association cannot be amended without the consent of the Special Shareholder.
These articles include the requirement that no foreign person, or foreign persons acting in concert, can have more than a 15% voting interest in the Company, the requirement that the majority of the directors are British, the requirement that decisions of the directors at their meetings, in their committees or via resolution must be approved by a majority of British directors and the requirement that the Chief Executive and any executive chairman are British citizens.
The effect of these requirements can also be amended by regulations made by the directors and approved by the Special Shareholder.
The Special Shareholder may require the Company at any time to redeem the Special Share at par or to convert the Special Share into one ordinary voting share.
The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the Companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
Placing of shares On 11 May 2007, 174,418,605 new ordinary shares of 2.5p each were placed at a price of 430p, raising 750m before expenses.
Conversion of preference shares As at 1 January 2007, the Company also had in issue 259,962,909 7.75p net cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each.
During the year, the shares were converted into ordinary shares of 2.5p each on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for each preference share, as a result of which 124,532,630 ordinary shares of 2.5p were issued.
There were, therefore, no preference shares in issue as at 31 December 2007.
In accordance with IAS 32 the convertible preference shares were considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt element and an equity component which required separate accounting treatment.
Following conversion to ordinary shares the amounts previously recognised within equity note 27 and within loans and overdrafts note 20 have been extinguished.
Treasury shares In connection with the disposal of its interest in Airbus, the Company stated its intention to return up to 500m to ordinary shareholders by way of on-market purchases of ordinary shares using authorities granted at the 2006 AGM and to hold the repurchased shares initially in treasury.
The Company commenced this buyback programme on 26 October 2006 and, as at 31 December 2007, 61,945,000 2006 28,675,000 2.5p ordinary shares with an aggregate nominal value of 2m 2006 1m were held in treasury.

Acquisition of subsidiaries The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year, the most significant of which was of Armor Holdings, Inc. in the US.
The acquisitions took place throughout the year, but if they had occurred on 1 January 2007, combined sales of Group and equity accounted investments would have been 17.4bn, revenue 16.0bn and profit for the year from continuing operations 946m.
Armor Holdings, Inc. On 31 July 2007, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Armor Holdings, Inc. Armor, in the US, for a consideration of 1,696m, excluding transaction costs incurred by the acquiree 26m.
Goodwill arising on consolidation amounted to 1,554m.
Armor is a major manufacturer of tactical wheeled vehicles and a leading provider of vehicle and individual armour systems and survivability technologies for the military and for the law enforcement and commercial security markets.
1 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2007, Armor contributed EBITA of 77m and profit after tax of 18m to the Groups consolidated results.
Mobile International, a subsidiary of Armor, was acquired with a view to immediate resale.
Accordingly, it has been classified as held for sale in the acquisition balance sheet and as at 31 December 2007 note 19.
The acquisition of Armor complements the existing US business in the Land & Armaments business group creating synergy potential.
It allows for continued development of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected MRAP vehicles and Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles FMTV programmes, as well as advanced ceramics for body armour.
The opportunities presented by these circumstances do not translate to separately identifiable intangible assets, but represent much of the assessed value within the Land & Armaments business group supporting the recognised goodwill.
Certain of the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired are provisional.
These will be amended as necessary in light of subsequent knowledge or events to the extent that these reflect conditions as at the date of acquisition.

As a result of these acquisitions, an additional 9m of goodwill was generated in the year.
During 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of National Sensor Systems, LLC.
for 5m in cash and paid deferred consideration of 7m in respect of its acquisition, in May 2005, of OMC Group.

The fair values of financial instruments have been determined based on available market information at the balance sheet date, and the valuation methodologies listed below: the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by discounting the contracted forward values and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of both interest rate and cross-currency swaps are calculated by discounting expected future principal and interest cash flows and translating at the appropriate balance sheet rates: the fair value of loans and overdrafts has been estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate marketbased interest rates prevailing at 31 December.
Due to the variability of the valuation factors, the fair values presented at the balance sheet date may not be indicative of the amounts the Group would expect to realise in a current market environment.

Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent on the market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a non-current receivable and at 31 December 2007 totalled 109m 2006 115m.
Committed undrawn borrowing facilities At 31 December 2007 the Group had a committed Revolving Credit Facility RCF of 1.5bn, which expires in more than two years but less than five years 2006 1.5bn which expires in more than two years but less than five years.
The RCF was originally contracted for five years until 2010.
However, it has been extended by the agreement of two one-year extensions until 2012, although the available amount for the final year has been reduced from 1.5bn to 1.3bn.
The RCF remained undrawn throughout the year.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate fluctuations The objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and deposits.
This is achieved through varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon by utilising derivative instruments, mainly interest rate swaps.
The Groups current interest rate management policy is that a minimum of 25% 2006 25% and a maximum of 75% 2006 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had 75% 2006 72% of fixed rate debt and 25% 2006 28% of floating rate debt based on a gross debt of 2.5bn 2006 3.1bn.
The floating rate debt has been predominantly achieved by entering into interest rate swaps which swap the fixed rate US dollar interest payable on debt into either floating rate sterling or US dollars.
At the end of 2007, the Group had a total of $1.3bn 2006 $1.6bn of this type of swap outstanding with a weighted average duration of 3.2 years 2006 3.6 years.
In respect of the fixed rate debt the weighted average period in respect of which interest is fixed was seven years 2006 six years.
Given the level of short-term interest rates during the year, the average cost of the floating rate debt was 6.7%, with 6.3% on US dollars and 7.3% on sterling 2006 both 5.8%.
The cost of the fixed rate debt was 7.1% 2006 7.0%.
A change of 100 basis points in short-term rates applied to the average fixed floating mix and level of borrowings would vary the interest cost to the Group by 7m 2006 11m.
In respect of cash deposits, given the fluctuation in the Groups working capital requirements, cash is generally invested for short-term periods based at floating interest rates.
A change of 100 basis points in the average interest rates during the year applied to the average cash deposits would vary the interest receivable by 23m 2006 15m.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents The Group is exposed to credit risk on its cash and cash equivalents to the extent of non-performance by its counterparties in respect of financial instruments.
However, the Group has policies in place to ensure credit risk is limited by placing concentration limits.
BAE Systems has a credit limit system to manage actively its exposure to treasury counterparties.
The cash and cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2007 of 3,062m 2006 3,100m was invested with 26 2006 45 financial institutions.
The system assigns a maximum exposure based on the counterpartys size, FT composite rating and Credit Default Swap price.
These limits are regularly monitored and updated.
The Group has material receivables due from the UK, US and Saudi Arabian governments where credit risk is not considered to be an issue.
For the remaining trade receivables no one counterparty constitutes more than 3% of the balance 2006 4%.
The cash and cash equivalents of the Group are invested in non-speculative financial instruments which are usually highly liquid such as shortterm deposits.
The Group, therefore, believes it has negligible exposure to price risk.
Currency risk In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the Groups policy is to hedge all material firm transactional exposures.
Further explanation is set out in the Risk management and principal risks section of the Directors report on page 50.
