14 Geographic and segment information At 31 December 2007, the Company is organized on a worldwide basis into three business segments, namely the Processor Division PD, the Physical IP Division PIPD and the Systems Design Division SDD.
In 2004, the directors were of the opinion the Company only had one class of business, and then following the acquisition of Artisan in December 2004, the Company had two reportable segments in 2005 namely PD and PIPD.
This was based upon the Companys internal organisation and management structure and was the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and the rest of the board were provided with financial information.
Whilst revenues were reported into four main revenue streams namely licensing, royalties, development systems and services, the costs, operating results and balance sheets were only analyzed into the two segments.
In 2006, this structure and system of internal financial reporting to the CODM and board was changed resulting in a third division, namely SDD called DevSys in 2006, now SDD, becoming a separate reportable segment.
In previous years, the results of SDD were reported within PD, but for ease of comparability, have been separated out in the comparatives below.
PIPD consists of the business stream previously undertaken by Artisan.
PD primarily comprises the legacy ARM products and services.
Recent acquisitions have been allocated to the various divisions as follows: KEG and KSI in 2005 to SDD, Falanx in 2006 to PD and Soisic in 2006 to PIPD.
Goodwill on each acquisition has also been allocated into these divisions, except for Artisan whereby this has been allocated between PD and PIPD.
