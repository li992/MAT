5 Dividends The board expects that Diageo will pay an interim dividend in April and a final dividend in October of each year.
Approximately 40% of the total dividend in respect of any financial year is expected to be paid as an interim dividend and approximately 60% as a final dividend.
The payment of any future dividends, subject to shareholder approval, will depend upon Diageos earnings, financial condition and such other factors as the board deems relevant.
Under IFRS, proposed dividends are not considered to be a liability until they are approved by the board for the interim dividend and by the shareholders at the annual general meeting for the final dividend.
The information provided in the tables above and below represents the amounts payable in respect of the relevant financial year, and the final dividend amount included in these tables represents the dividend proposed by the directors but not approved by the shareholders and therefore is not reflected as a deduction from reserves at the balance sheet date.
The table below sets out the amounts of interim, final and total cash dividends paid by the company on each ordinary share.
The dividends are translated into US dollars per ADS each ADS representing four ordinary shares at the noon buying rate on each of the respective dividend payment dates.
In the table above, an exchange rate of 1 $2.01 has been assumed for this dividend, but the exact amount of the payment to US ADR holders will be determined by the rate of exchange on 22 October 2007.
