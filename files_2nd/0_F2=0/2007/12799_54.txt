2 2006 fair values relate to the acquisition of Spirit Group Holdings Limited on 5 January 2006.
In the current year, the fair value adjustments primarily relate to the revaluation of freehold and leasehold trading properties and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities on revalued properties.
Included in the 18.4m August 2006: 269.0m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include an assembled workforce and operating synergies.
The fair values that were disclosed in the prior year for the Spirit group were finalised at 5 January 2007.
The impact was to reduce the fair value of net assets acquired by 34.4m due to the recognition of additional deferred tax liabilities on properties following the finalisation of tax base costs.
The updated numbers have been shown in the table above.
