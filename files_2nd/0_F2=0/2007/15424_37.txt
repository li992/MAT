During the year, provisional fair values recognised in the prior year have been adjusted as the fair value process was completed.
Prior year balances have not been restated as the adjustments are not significant to the group.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions represents the value of assembled workforces and synergies available to the group.
All intangible assets acquired with the businesses have been recognised at their respective fair values separately from goodwill.
Each 2007 acquisition is considered to be a separate cash generating unit for the purpose of impairment reviews.
