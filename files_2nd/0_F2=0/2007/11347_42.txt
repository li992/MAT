90 NORTHUMBRIAN WATER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 06 07 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued The disclosures have been prepared using the same mortality assumptions as those used at the most recent formal valuation namely the standard PA92 tables, including an allowance for future improvements in mortality based on the year of birth of the membership.
These assumptions imply an assumed life expectancy for a member aged 60 at 31 March 2007 of 24.6 years 2006: 24.5 years for males and 27.6 years 2006: 27.5 years for females.
The effect of increasing the assumed life expectancies by one year would be to increase the value of liabilities by around 2.5%.
