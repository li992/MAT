Financial commitments and contingent liabilities 2007 2006 m m Contracts placed for capital expenditure not provided in the accounts 752 704 Operating lease payments payable within one year of the balance sheet date were in respect of leases expiring: Within one year 18 17 Between one and five years 120 103 After five years 381 394 Total payable within one year 519 514 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of leases of land and buildings.
At 31 March 2007, other than disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the company business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The company has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The company has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O2 UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001.
O2 plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum likely exposure is US$82 million 39 million as at 31 March 2007, although this could increase by a further US$486 million 248 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O2 UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company.
There have been criminal proceedings in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
On 20 July 2005, the former BT employee was found not culpable of the fraud charge brought by the Rome Public Prosecutor.
All the other defendants were also acquitted.
The Public Prosecutor is in the process of appealing the courts decision.
If the appeal is successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.
Following the European Commissions formal investigation into the way the UK government set BTs property rates and those paid by Kingston Communications, and whether the government complied with European Community treaty roles on state aid, the Commission concluded that no state aid had been granted.
The Commissions decision has now been appealed but the company continues to believe that any allegation of state aid is groundless and that the appeal will not succeed.
Retirement benets Background The company offers retirement benefit schemes to its employees.
The companys main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme, the BT Retirement Plan BTRP.

The total cost relating to the BTPS was 593 million 2006: 550 million, of which 585 million 2006: 544 million was borne by the company.
An element of the total charge relating to the BTPS is recharged to fellow subsidiary undertakings who are participating employers in the pension scheme.
The company retains the full liability of the BTPS.
Dened contribution schemes The profit and loss charge in respect of dened contribution schemes represents the contribution payable by the company based on a xed percentage of employees pay.
The pension cost for the year in respect of the companys main dened contribution scheme was 28 million 2006: 19 million and 3 million 2006: 2 million of contributions were outstanding at 31 March 2007.
Dened benefit schemes BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the trust deed of the BTPS, there are nine trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the chairman of the trustee directors.
Four trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the trustee directors will normally hold senior positions with the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2007, the UK equities included 14 million 2006: 15 million ordinary shares of the ultimate parent company, BT Group plc, with a market value of 43 million 2006: 33 million.

Derivatives continued Fair value of financial instruments The following table discloses the carrying amounts and fair values of all of the companys financial instruments which are not carried at an amount which approximates to its fair value on the balance sheet at 31 March 2007 and 2006.
The carrying amounts are included in the company balance sheet under the indicated headings.
The fair value of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation or sale.
In particular, the fair values of listed investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the companys bonds, debentures, notes, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The fair value of the companys outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts where the estimated amounts, calculated using discounted cash ow models, that the company would receive or pay in order to terminate such contracts in an arms length transaction taking into account market rates of interest and foreign exchange of the balance sheet date.

Audit Services Information relating to fees for audit services paid or payable to the companys auditor,  LLP, is included in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements of BT plc.
Post balance sheet events In April 2007, we announced a new structure that will deliver faster, more resilient and cost effective services to customers wherever they are.
With effect from 1 July 2007, BT Design will be responsible for the design and development of the platforms, systems and processes, which will support our services: BT Operate will be responsible for their deployment and operation.
Around 20,000 employees from design, operations, IT and networks will move into these new units.
We estimate that the reorganisation and transformation activities will result in restructuring costs of around 450 million which is expected to generate a payback within two to three years.
These activities will include developing new processes and systems, re-skilling and leaver costs which will be accommodated within existing policies and by voluntary means.
We expect the majority of these costs to be incurred in the 2008 financial year.
