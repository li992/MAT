GOODWILL m Cost: At 1 April 2005 64.4 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 34.2 At 1 April 2006 98.6 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries note 37 35.7 At 31 March 2007 134.3 Carrying amount: At 31 March 2006 98.6 At 31 March 2007 134.3 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash-generating unit CGU expected to benefit from that business combination.
All of the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the waste management segment which is considered to be a single CGU, as it is an integrated business.
Goodwill is reviewed annually or when other events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable.
The recoverable amount of the waste management segment is determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in those calculations relate to discount rates, cash flows, price increases and for landfill, the compaction rate.
Cash flow projections are based on approved budgets and plans for the next five years and beyond this period on long-term growth rates for the waste sector based on GDP.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.4% which reflects the overall business risks associated with the waste management segment activities.
