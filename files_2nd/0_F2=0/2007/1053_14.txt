2 EBITDA refers to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation and is defined in Note 5 a i vii to the financial statements.
EBITDA for 2006 and 2007 is reconciled to operating profit from subsidiaries and joint ventures in the Financial Review on page 26.
3 Earnings per share and dividends per share have been restated for the effects of the 4-for-1 bonus issue on 19 June 2006.
4 During 2003, Antofagasta plc demerged its 33.6% investment in Quinenco S. A.
As a result of the demerger, ordinary shareholders in Antofagasta received a special dividend on one share in Andsberg Limited for each share held in Antofagasta.
Andsberg is an unlisted Jerseyregistered company which has as its principal asset the investment in Quienco.
The Andsberg shares were redeemable for a limited period at 22.2 cents per share US$111 per share prior to the restatement for the 2006 bonus issue and this value has been used to derive the value of the total dividend per share of 29.2 cents restated for 2003.
5 The order of presentation of items of the summary UK GAAP cash flow statements for 2003 has been amended to facilitate comparison with the summary IFRS cash flow statements for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.
6 Short-term cash investments maturing within three months of acquisition previously disclosed under UK GAAP as current asset investments are classified under IFRS as cash equivalents.
Due to these differences in classification, the net increase in cash and cash equivalents under IFRS does not correspond to the net cash outflow in the year under UK GAAP.
For the summary UK GAAP cash flow statement for 2003, net cashflow in the year before movement in term deposits has been computed to provide a more comparable but not equivalent measure to net increase in cash and cash equivalents under IFRS.
7 Borrowings under IFRS include amounts due under finance leases and preference shares.
8 Loans under UK GAAP include amounts due under finance leases.
