Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments a Group financial and treasury risk management policies: The Group is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group monitors and manages these risks as an integral part of the Groups overall risk management programme, which recognises the unpredictability of the markets in which it operates and seeks to reduce their potentially adverse effects on the Groups results, where economically and commercially possible.
i Foreign exchange risk management: The Group sells its products in over 120 countries and has manufacturing operations in eight countries.
As a result, the Group faces transactional currency exposure when the Groups operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.
Foreign exchange transaction exposures are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries within the Groups policies and guidelines.
The central treasury function enters into foreign exchange hedging transactions on behalf of subsidiaries where this is beneficial to the Group.
The Group has significant capital employed in overseas operations.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group has a policy to hedge this risk, where appropriate, to limit the effect of foreign exchange rate movements.
Accordingly the Group has loans in the same currencies as the capital employed in the Groups main overseas operations.
From time to time, the Group uses cross currency swap instruments to also convert the currency of the Groups borrowings to such functional currencies.
ii Commodity risk management: The Group is subject to market risk in respect of commodities mainly base metals since the Groups ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which it operates.
In some instances the Group may not be able to pass increased costs onto its customers.
The Group enters into arrangements to facilitate an adequate supply of materials, as well as to lock into pre-determinable pricing levels.
These supply contracts are typically for a period of six to 36 months.
Some of the Groups purchase contracts fix the price of items bought, while other contracts allow for price variations based on the price of certain metals such as nickel, copper and aluminium.
To reduce exposures to fluctuations in the price of these metals the Group may fix the price with its suppliers, or in some instances enter into external contracts for difference with major financial institutions that have the effect of fixing the overall price paid.
The Groups policy is to apply hedge accounting see below where it is both permissible under IAS39, practical to do so and its application reduces earnings volatility.
However, in certain instances transactions that may be effective hedges in economic terms may not always qualify for hedge accounting under IAS39.
iii Interest rate risk management: The Group finances its operation through a mix of retained profits and borrowings.
To reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups borrowings, the Groups policy is to have fixed rate debt equal to at least 50% of its borrowings.
Accordingly, the Group may contract with major financial institutions for interest rate swap agreements, where the Group agrees to exchange the difference between a fixed interest rate and a variable interest rate, as applied to a notional principal amount.
iv Liquidity risk management: The Groups policy is to hold cash and cash equivalents and maintain undrawn credit facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations as well as any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
v Credit risk management: The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial assets, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Groups policy of selecting counterparties with high credit ratings.
The exposure to credit loss of liquid assets is equivalent to the carrying value on the balance sheet.
The maximum credit exposure of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to the Groups trade and other receivables are limited by the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
The Group therefore believes that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of normal provision for doubtful receivables.
In the normal course of business, the Group has entered into arrangements in respect of performance bonds, letters of credit and other guarantee arrangements.
The Group treats these arrangements as executory contracts until such time as the Group is required to perform under the prescribed arrangements.
However, these arrangements still subject the Group to potential credit risk.
The maximum credit risk at 29 September 2007 on recognised financial assets is 176.2m 2006: 193.1m.
Notes to the consolidated financial statements | Enodis plc | 95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued b Hedge accounting: As described above, the Groups risk management policies include hedging foreign exchange risks, interest rate risks and commodity price risk using a range of hedging instruments.
Where possible the Group applies hedge accounting, as summarised below: i Net investment hedges: From time to time the Group uses cross currency swap instruments to align Sterling borrowings to the underlying net investment held in foreign currencies.
To the extent that these hedges are effective, changes in the fair value of these derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges are included within equity reserves until earnings are affected by the hedged item.
Ineffective portions of such hedges are recognised immediately in profit and loss.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, or when it is no longer probable that the investments will remain.
When hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective hedge, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value, with subsequent changes in fair value recognised in current period earnings.
Gains and losses related to discontinued hedges that were previously included in equity reserves will remain in equity reserves until the disposal of the underlying investment.
As at 29 September 2007 the Group had no cross currency swap instruments outstanding 2006: nil.
ii Cash flow hedges: The Groups interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and certain commodity contracts for difference are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
Upon the designation of these derivatives as cash flow hedges, any effective gains and losses arising are deferred in equity reserves.
Any ineffective portions are recognised in profit and loss immediately.
The effective gains and losses deferred in equity are taken to the income statement at the same time as the hedged item impacts profit and loss.
The following table summarises the fair value of the Groups outstanding derivatives: Financial asset liability 2007 2006 m m Interest rate swaps 0.4 Commodity contracts for difference 0.2 0.1 Foreign exchange forward contracts 0.2 0.4 0.5 The Groups commodity contracts for difference have maturity dates of less than one year.
c Financial instrument profiles and summary of interest rates: The Groups financial assets are either available on demand or have maturity dates due within one year except for the Groups investments in Rabbi Trusts, which are held to meet the underlying pension obligations, the bulk of which are non-current in nature.

Where interest rate swaps are taken out, the payment dates of such swaps are matched to the interest payment dates of the Groups revolving credit facility.
The Groups interest rate swaps are also denominated in the same currency as the related borrowings.
As at 29 September 2007, the Group had gross borrowings of 145.5m, of which 85.1m was fixed.
83.4m was fixed under the Private Placement, which matures in September 2014 and September 2017.
The remaining 1.7m relates to other minor fixed rate borrowing.
In total, fixed rate borrowings represented 58% of the Groups total borrowings, 42% 60.4m remains floating rate or non-interest bearing.
A hypothetical 100-basis point increase in the interest rates associated with the Groups floating rate borrowings during 2007 would have increased the Groups interest expense by approximately 0.8m.
The floating rate cash and cash equivalents comprise certain bank accounts that earn interest.
The non-interest bearing cash and cash equivalents relate to uncleared receipts and cash in current accounts.
The non-interest bearing investments comprise Rabbi Trust investments that are held in unit trusts.
