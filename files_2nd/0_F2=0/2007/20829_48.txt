The Amlin Group is the employer in respect of two sections of the scheme, the Amlin section, as in previous years, and now also the J E Mumford section as a result of the transfer during February 2007.
The summary of liabilities at 31 December 2007 includes liabilities relating to the J E Mumford section.
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyds market.
As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, employers closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only around five 2006: five employers with active members in the Fund.
A large proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund.
The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current active employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole.
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustee has split the Fund into a number of notional sections.
This is a notional split and has no legal force.
Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employers active members and one combined section for non-employed members of all current and former employers.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustee altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities.
A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer contribute to the Fund Orphan Section.
Amlin is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Sections liabilities.
Since this alteration Amlin can now more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund.
However, as the asset allocation is notional and at the discretion of the Trustee, it is not possible for Amlin to be certain of its overall surplus or deficit at any time.
Indeed, as other employers have bought themselves out of the scheme in recent years, Amlin has been notionally allocated an increased share of the scheme.
For this reason the scheme continues to be classified as a multi-employer scheme for the purposes of International Accounting Standard No 19 IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
The Group is required to recognise the net present value of any contribution schedule that has been agreed with the Trustee.
Therefore, 0.2 million 2006: 0.2 million was charged to the Group result relating to the unwinding of the discount on the future contractual payments.
80 Amlin plc Annual Report 2007 Performance 27 Retirement benefit obligations continued The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary.
Contributions are made at the funding rates recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period.
Amounts borne under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other Group companies.
However, actuarial amounts quoted below are for the Groups notional share of the scheme.
The last completed formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2004 and was carried out by Mr P Lofthouse, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, and used the projected unit credit actuarial method.
For the purposes of providing disclosures in accordance with IAS19, the Group has requested the actuary update the 2004 valuation to 31 December 2006 and 2007 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 2007 2006 % pa % pa Price inflation 3.4 3.1 Rate of increase in pay Rate of increase in pensions payment LPI maximum 5% pa 3.4 3.1 LPI minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa 3.6 3.25 LPI maximum 3% pa 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 3.4 3.1 Discount rate 5.7 5.1 During 2005 the Group reviewed its remaining defined benefit arrangements and made a number of changes to the Amlin sections future benefit structure, which were implemented during 2006.
In particular in order to remove much of the risk associated with salary inflation, the Amlin section was changed to allow members to continue accruing additional years service under the schemes, but these accruals would be generally based on March 2006 pensionable salaries.
Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes.
Therefore the salary inflation assumption used for the ongoing valuation is now nil%.
The mortality assumptions used in the latest valuation included the following life expectancies: 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 Life expectancy years at age 60 for a member currently: Male Female Male Female Aged 60 25.2 28.2 25.0 28.1 Aged 45 26.6 29.4 26.1 29.1 The analysis of the Funds assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date are as follows: Asset mix 31 December 2007 Asset mix 31 December 2006 Long term rate of return 31 December 31 December Amlin Orphans Amlin Orphans Sections Section Sections Section 2007 2006 Equities 32% 32% 45% 20% 7.6% 7.5% Bonds 68% 68% 55% 80% 5.4% 4.9% The long term rates of return are estimated by the Directors based upon current expectations of future investment performance.
The updated assessment at 31 December 2007 showed that the assets notionally relating to the Amlin section of the Fund were 152 million 2006 : 146 million.
The fair value of the assets in the scheme as a whole at 31 December 2007 was 318 million 2006: 315 million, being 23 million greater than 2006: 11 million the amount required to fund members accrued liabilities on the assumptions adopted, resulting in a surplus of 8% 2006: 4%.
The table below shows the impact on the defined benefit obligation that a change in certain key assumptions would have.
Defined benefit obligation impact Assumption change m Increase decrease in discount rate by 0.25% 12 12 Increase decrease in inflation rate by 0.25% 6 6 Increase in floor mortality improvements for males of 1.5% and females of 1.0% per annum 6 The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund for Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Group companies are analysed in the table below.

This agreement was based on the formal valuation at 31 March 2004 and not the updated valuation at 31 December 2004.
The first payment was made in December 2004 and five subsequent annual payments were agreed commencing on 31 March 2005.
In 2004 Amlin agreed to pay contributions to the notional orphans section to rectify a share of the funding shortfall revealed in the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004, when the Group and Syndicates share of the shortfall was estimated to be 11.4 million and 12.8 million respectively.
The first payment of 3.5 million was made on 31 December 2004.
Three subsequent annual payments of 3.5 million were agreed commencing on 31 March 2005.
