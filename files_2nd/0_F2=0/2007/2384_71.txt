This information is prepared in compliance with the requirements of FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
69 Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities.
Future net cash ows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized.
These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of year-end crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates.
Furthermore, both reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change.
BP cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.
b Production costs, which include production taxes, and development costs relating to future production of proved reserves are based on year-end cost levels and assume continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future decommissioning costs are included.
c Taxation is computed using appropriate year-end statutory corporate income tax rates.
d Future net cash flows from oil and natural gas production are discounted at 10% regardless of the group assessment of the risk associated with its producing activities.
e Minority interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC amounted to $2,300 million at 31 December 2007 $1,300 million at 31 December 2006 and $2,700 million at 31 December 2005. f Total change in the standardized measure during the year includes the effect of exchange rate movements.

Operational and statistical information The following tables present operational and statistical information related to production, drilling, productive wells and acreage.
b Crude oil includes natural gas liquids and condensate.
c Natural gas production excludes gas consumed in operations.
Productive oil and gas wells and acreage The following tables show the number of gross and net productive oil and natural gas wells and total gross and net developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas acreage in which the group and its equity-accounted entities had interests as of 31 December 2007.
A gross well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of net wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres.
Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production.
Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a eld, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves: while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.
b Includes approximately 2,489 gross 1,591 net multiple completion wells.
If one of the multiple completions in a well is an oil completion, the well is classified as an oil well.

Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.
A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.
Suspended development wells and long-term suspended exploratory wells are also included in the table.
