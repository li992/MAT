VAT in Russia is legally recoverable but for companies in the exploration phase recovery is uncertain.
As a result, whilst the Group was in the exploration phase, the Directors felt it was prudent to reflect this uncertainty and provided against the net VAT recoverable in 2004 and 2005.
In 2007, the Group received the final cash repayments of $1.2 million 2006: $4.3 million relating to VAT recoverable in respect of 2004 and 2005.
The Group also began to produce oil, which improved its ability to recover VAT.
As a result, the Group has credited an amount equal to the cash repayments received previously provided against back to the income statement.
