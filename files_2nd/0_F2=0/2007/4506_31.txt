In accordance with IFRS accounting requirements this dividend has not been accrued in these consolidated financial statements.
On 5 August 2005, the Company paid a special dividend of 38.0p per share amounting to 68.3m the Special Dividend.
The Companys distributable profits reported in its annual accounts for the year ended 26 March 2005 were 50.2m.
Under the Companies Act 1985 the Act, distributions by the Company must not exceed the amount of the distributable profits that are reported in the Companys last annual accounts unless interim accounts demonstrate that there are sufficient distributable profits.
Therefore the Company took appropriate steps to ensure that it had more than sufficient distributable profits to pay the Special Dividend and prepared interim accounts to demonstrate this.
It recently came to the Directors attention that these interim accounts were not approved and filed with Companies House as required.
However, as the Company had sufficient distributable profits, the Directors believe that this technical breach of the Act has not prejudiced either shareholders or creditors of the Company.
As a result the Company has a potential claim to recover the Special Dividend paid in August 2005 from shareholders who received it.
The Company does not intend to make such a claim and the Board has remedied this situation by resolving on 27 November 2006 to pay a new interim dividend of 68.3m with the same record date as the Special Dividend.
The Companys obligation to pay the new interim dividend is satisfied by the Company waiving its rights to recover the Special Dividend paid in August 2005.
Any profits required to pay the new interim dividend as appropriated from profits shown in the Companys accounts for the year ended 25 March 2006.
No cash will be required to be paid either to or by any shareholder.
The effect of this is to ensure that no shareholder is either better or worse off than would have been the case if the Special Dividend had met all of the technical requirements of the Act.
For the sake of good order a resolution seeking shareholder ratification and approval of the steps taken by the Board to remedy the position will be proposed at the Companys next Annual General Meeting.
HM Revenue and Customs has confirmed that it will continue to treat the Special Dividend paid on 5 August 2005 as a distribution for UK tax purposes made at the time at which the Special Dividend was paid and that the steps taken to remedy the position will have no tax implications for the shareholders.
