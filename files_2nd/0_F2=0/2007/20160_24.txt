Structural currency exposures are reduced by matching assets denominated in foreign currency with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group makes some use of derivative financial instruments to effect foreign exchange management.
The exposure to the Euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and all other currencies combined, is shown in the table below.
The assets are funded with a mixture of shareholders funds and borrowings according to the risk characteristics of the assets.
The interest rate exposure is minimised by matching the type and maturity of the borrowings to those of the corresponding assets.
Some derivative instruments are used to achieve this objective.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is shown in the table below by the earlier of the contractual repricing or maturity date.

Foreign currency interest-bearing loans and borrowings are also used for this purpose.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.

In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are included in the income statement.
