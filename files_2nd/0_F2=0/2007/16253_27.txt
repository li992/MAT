Basis of preparation The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
They have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Companys annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007, except for the adoption of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and UITF 44 FRS 20 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The adoption of FRS 29 did not have an impact on the Companys financial statements due to the exemption provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 which states that disclosure of financial instruments is not required in parent company financial statements.
The adoption of UITF 44 has resulted in a prior year adjustment to show the equity-settled share based payments charge of 13.4m as an increase in the Companys investment in its subsidiaries with a corresponding increase to reserves.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
Significant accounting policies Investments Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost or nominal value of shares issued where merger relief is taken, less any provision for impairment.
Where the recoverable amount of the investment is less than the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency transactions arising from operating activities are translated from local currency into pounds sterling at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the period end exchange rate.
Foreign currency gains or losses are credited or charged to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Financial instruments Financial instruments in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions provided in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 which states that disclosure of financial instruments is not required in parent company financial statements.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share based payments Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share based compensation is accounted for as equitysettled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Share based payments, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, in the financial statements of the parent United Business Media plc, the Company has recognised an addition to fixed asset investments of the aggregate amount of these contributions of 6.9m 2006: 7.0m with a credit to equity for the same amount.
This represents a change in accounting policy and therefore the comparative figures have been adjusted to reflect additions to fixed asset investments of 13.4m, being the equity-settled share based payments charge for the accounting periods since FRS 20 became effective.
Cash flow statement The Company has utilised the exemptions provided under FRS 1 Revised and has not presented a cash flow statement.
A consolidated cash flow statement has been presented in the Group financial statements of United Business Media plc.
Related party transactions The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions in paragraph 3 of FRS 8 which states that disclosure of related party transactions is not required in parent company financial statements when those statements are presented together with its consolidated financial statements.
Profit for the year As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year.
United Business Media plc reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of 73.4m 2006: 81.3m.
The auditors remuneration for audit services to the Company was 10,000 2006: 10,000.
Fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP and its associates for non-audit services to the Company are not disclosed in the individual accounts of United Business Media plc because Group financial statements are prepared which are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.
Details of executive and non-executive directors emoluments and their interest in share and options of the Company are shown within the directors remuneration report in the sections Directors pension provision, Directors remuneration, Directors interests in shares and Directors interests in share options.
