com Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements 45 Notes to the Financial Statements forming part of the financial information 1 Corporate information The consolidated financial statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC for the period ended 31 December 2007 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 25 February 2008.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 60 to 64.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes: Note 3 & 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment Note 14 accruals for legal cases Note 18 share-based payments Basis of consolidation These consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Foreign currency The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign operation Icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue Internet business The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the consumer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Intermediary business Commissions are recognised on completed transactions in the period that a transaction completes.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
46 Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements www.
com Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and ttings 5 years Ofce equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identied as having nite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a nite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with nite lives is recognised in the Income Statement in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are dened as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, tradenames and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer provider lists, customer provider contracts and relationships, and noncontractual customer provider relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer provider relationships and customer provider lists have been identied separately.
Relationships with high-prole customers providers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and trafc on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer provider lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Income Statement.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the greater of their net realisable value and value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Income Statement when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in SIC 32.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Income Statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Cash Flow Statement.
Employee benets Dened contribution plans Obligations for contributions to dened contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Income Statement as incurred.
com Annual Report 2007 Financial Statements 47 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions The share option programme allows certain Group employees to acquire shares of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC: these awards are granted by Moneysupermarket.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using the BlackScholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Short-term benets Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Income Statement as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Net nancing costs Net nancing costs comprise interest payable and interest receivable, and are recognised in the Income Statement as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the period as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with nite lives which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
This liability will decrease in line with the amortisation of the related intangible assets, with the deferred tax credit recognised in the Income Statement in accordance with IAS 12.
At the period end, this liability was revalued at the enacted corporation tax rate of 28%, this being the rate at which the liability will unwind.
Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital and retained earnings and reserves where applicable.
The Group has no debt as at 31 December 2007 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements: management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.

com Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Application of recently issued amended IFRSs A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2007, and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements: IFRS 8 Operating Segments introduces the management approach to segment reporting.
IFRS 8, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements, will require the disclosure of segment information based on the internal reports regularly reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker in order to assess each segments performance and to allocate resources to them.
Currently the Group presents segment information in respect of internet and intermediary segments.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions requires a share-based payment arrangement in which an entity receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments to be accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payments transaction, regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained.
IFRIC 11 will become mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, with retrospective application required.
It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements provides guidance on certain recognition and measurement issues that arise in accounting for public-to-private service concessions arrangements.
IFRIC 12, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, is not expected to have any effect on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes addresses the accounting by entities that operate, or otherwise participate in, customer loyalty programmes for their customers.
It relates to customer loyalty programmes under which the customer can redeem credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
IFRIC 13, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2009 financial statements, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction claries when refunds or reductions in future contributions in relation to dened benefit assets should be regarded as available and provides guidance on the impact of minimum funding requirements on such assets.
IFRIC 14, which becomes mandatory for the Groups 2008 financial statements, with retrospective application required, is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires presentation of all non-owner changes in equity either in a single statement of comprehensive equity, or in an income statement plus a statement of comprehensive equity.
The amended standard, which will become effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 with earlier adoption permitted, will require a change in the presentation of the Groups financial statements.
Amendment to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to an acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of the asset, removing the option to recognise the costs as an expense.
The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Its effect on the consolidated financial statements can only be assessed when the standard is applied.
Amendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements requires changes to the accounting for a noncontrolling interest in and the loss of control of a subsidiary.
The amendments, which are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009, and apply retrospectively, except in certain circumstances, are not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations extends the scope of IFRS 3 to include business combinations involving only mutual entities, and to business combinations achieved by contract alone.
The revised standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The carrying amount of any assets and liabilities that arose under business combinations prior to the application of IFRS 3 2008 are not adjusted, and therefore the revised standard is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Exposure Draft for Proposed Amendment to IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments will provide clarity that an entity that receives goods or services from a supplier would apply IFRS 2, even if the entity has no obligation to make the required share-based cash payments related to such goods or services.
The amendment is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated financial statements, although the share based payment charge may increase when the Simon Nixon Scheme is completed.

com Notes to the Financial Statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued During the period, the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualied and experienced independent third party to value the internet segments intangible assets.
This valuation has been used as the carrying value for these assets.
The intermediary segment was determined to have no intangible assets and, having generated a loss for the period of 114,000, to have little or no value.
Accordingly, all the value of the Group was assigned to the internet segment which is considered to be one cash generating unit.
The Group believes the most appropriate method by which to assess impairment of the internet segment is the quoted market price of the Group.
At the balance sheet date, the market capitalisation of the Group exceeded the carrying value of the Groups assets by 70%.
The Group has also undertaken an impairment review to assess the units value in use.
This calculation has been based on the results for 2007, the Group budget for 2008 and a discount rate of 10% has been applied.

The Group invests its cash in a range of cash deposit accounts with UK Banks.
Interest earned therefore closely follows movements in Bank of England base rates.

At the balance sheet date, 49,854,000 was invested with Bank of Scotland, this being the most invested with any one bank.
