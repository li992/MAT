Fair value is determined by reference to market based evidence, which is the amounts for which the assets could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arms length transaction as at the valuation date.
The market value of these investment properties amounted to 773,095,000 which is also the fair value.
The property valuer is independent and external to the Group.
The property valuer takes account of deleterious materials included in the construction of the investment properties in arriving at its estimate of open market valuation when the Investment Managers advise of the presence of such materials.
The Group has entered into leases on its property portfolio as lessor See note 17 for further information.
No one property accounts for more than 15 per cent of the gross assets of the Group.
All leasehold properties have more than 60 years remaining on the lease term.
There are no restrictions on the realisability of the Group's investment properties or on the remittance of income or proceeds of disposal.
However, the Groups investments comprise UK commercial property, which may be difficult to realise.
Property and property related assets are inherently difficult to value due to the individual nature of such property.
As a result, valuations are subject to substantial uncertainty.
There is no assurance that the estimates resulting from the valuation process will reflect the actual sales price even where the actual sales occur shortly after the valuation date.
The Group is under no contractual obligations to purchase, construct or develop any investment property.
The majority of the leases are on a full repairing basis and as such the Group is not liable for costs in respect of repairs, maintenance or enhancements to its investment properties.
Included within the total market value of the property portfolio, are units in the Jersey Property Unit Trust which holds the property at Kensington High Street, London.
99.5 per cent of the units in this Unit Trust are held by UKCPT Limited Partnership and 0.5 per cent is held by UK Commercial Property Holdings Limited.
