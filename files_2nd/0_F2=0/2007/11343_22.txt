Goodwill has arisen on Group acquisitions and represents future economic benefits arising from assets that cannot be identified individually and recognised separately and therefore is measured as a residual.
Goodwill includes items such as the value of employees, development costs where the company does not have the information available to identify this separately, technical knowledge and the synergies expected from integrating the businesses into the Group.
During the year ended 30 April 2006, the Group purchased the ordinary shares of Human and Legal Group Limited for a total consideration, settled in cash including debt and cash acquired of 2,145,000.
The total adjustments made to the recognised value of assets and liabilities of the company acquired in order to present the net assets of that company at fair values in accordance with Group accounting principles were 653,000.
This principally related to adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill and other assets and adjustments to accounting policies to bring in line with those of the Group.
Disclosure of the revenue and net profit of acquisitions for the year as though the acquisition date for all acquisitions effected in the year had been the beginning of that year is considered to be impractical.
