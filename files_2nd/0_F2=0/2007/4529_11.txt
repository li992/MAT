DIRECTORS RESPONSIBILITIES Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profits or loss of the Group for that period.
The directors are required to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The directors confirm that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the EU.
They also confirm the Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards.
The directors confirm that suitable accounting policies have been used and applied consistently except where required to comply with the new accounting policies.
They also confirm that reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates have been made in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 1 September 2007 and that applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control, for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
