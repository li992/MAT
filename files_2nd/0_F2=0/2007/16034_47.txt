For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel and represents managements assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 would have increased decreased by 5m 2006: increased decreased by 4m : net equity would have decreased increased by 2m 2006: decreased increased by 4m mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate debt instruments and the decrease in the nominal value of interest rate derivatives.
