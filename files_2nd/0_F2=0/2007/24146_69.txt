Capital a Overview The Groups Life & Pensions business manages its capital on both economic capital and regulatory bases: The economic capital model helps in setting our own financial risk appetite and in actively managing financial risk.
The economic capital model compares total available FPLP capital resources, calculated on a realistic basis, with the risk capital required to cover unexpected losses.
The Group complies with all regulatory capital requirements: these include the Insurance Groups Directive IGD and individual company regulatory requirements.
The Life & Pensions capital statement, drawn up in accordance with FRS 27, illustrates the financial strength of the Life & Pensions business and is set out in section b.
Total available capital resources are calculated on a realistic basis for the FPLP With-Profits Fund and on a regulatory basis for all other funds.
IGD looks at capital from a Group shareholder perspective and is a prudent measure in that surplus capital not immediately available to shareholders, such as surplus capital in the long-term funds, is excluded from the calculation.
A reconciliation of IFRS Equity attributable to equityholders of the parent, capital resources per the Capital Statement and Life & Pensions Capital on an IGD basis is set out below.

Capital continued iv Basis of calculating capital requirements for Life & Pensions business Each Life & Pensions company has to hold sufficient capital to meet its regulatory capital requirements.
For the FPLP With-Profits Fund, the capital requirement is the risk capital margin RCM which amounts to 246m 2006: 220m.
This is calculated on a defined set of adverse scenarios prescribed by the FSA the market risk scenarios tested are what would happen if property prices fall by 12.5%, equity prices fall by 20%, corporate bonds spreads increase by 6.45%, fixed interest yields rise 0.80% and persistency increases by 32.5%.
The RCM is based on the asset mix at the year-end and takes into account hedging strategies and certain other actions management would take in the event of particular adverse market conditions.
Under the realistic capital methodology, the capital requirement is the higher of the twin peaks test of the realistic peak and the regulatory peak.
In the FPLP With-Profits Fund, the realistic peak applied in both 2007 and 2006.
This has resulted in a With-Profits Insurance Capital Component WPICC of 1,226m 2006: 961m required to bring the regulatory peak of 1,563m 2006: 1,475m in line with the realistic peak of nil 2006: nil as adjusted for the value of future transfers to shareholders to be deducted from the WPICC: this has resulted in a surplus in the FPLP With-Profits Fund, on a regulatory basis, of 337m 2006: 514m.

For the FPLA closed With-Profits Fund, the capital requirement has been calculated on a regulatory basis in accordance with FSA regulations at 20m 2006: 21m.
For UK non-participating funds, the relevant capital requirement is the capital resources requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
For overseas business, local regulatory capital requirements are determined and these amount to 40m 2006: 33m.
This is analysed as 10m 2006: 9m for FPI and 30m 2006: 24m for Lombard.
