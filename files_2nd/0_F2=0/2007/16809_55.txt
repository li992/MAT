Banks loans include a ZAR8 billion loan held by Vodafone Holdings SA Pty Limited VHSA, which directly and indirectly owns the Groups 50% interest in Vodacom Group Pty Limited.
VHSA has pledged its 100% equity shareholding in Vodafone Investments SA VISA as security for its loan obligations.
The terms and conditions of the pledge mean that should VHSA not meet all of its loan payment and performance obligations, the lenders may sell the equity shareholding in its subsidiary VISA at market value to recover their losses, with any remaining sales proceeds being returned to VHSA.
Vodafone International Holdings BV and VISA have also guaranteed this loan with recourse only to the VHSA and Vodafone Telecommunications Investment SA VTISA shares they have respectively pledged.
The terms and conditions of the security arrangement mean the lenders may be able to sell these respective shares in preference to the VISA shares held by VHSA.
An arrangement has been put in place, where the Vodacom Group Pty Limited shares held by VHSA and VTISA are held in an escrow account to ensure the shares cannot be sold to satisfy the pledge made by both companies.
The maximum collateral provided is ZAR8.6 billion, being the carrying value of the bank loan as at 31 March 2007.
