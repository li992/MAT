13 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those: held in the Employee Share Ownership Trust, the Employee Benefit Trust see note 30, and treasury shares all of which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares from the start of the accounting period.
The Company has only one category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: those share options and awards granted to directors and employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: Weighted Weighted average average number of number of Earnings ordinary Earnings ordinary 2007 shares 2006 shares m 2007 m 2006 For basic earnings per share 413.5 300,673,519 396.4 296,155,856 Options and awards 1,539,446 1,762,783 For diluted earnings per share 413.5 302,212,965 396.4 297,918,639 Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 65 14 Intangible assets Goodwill Brand Know how Total Group m m m m Cost At 1 January 2006 182.0 182.0 On acquisition of subsidiary 226.8 60.0 1.9 288.7 At 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2007 408.8 60.0 1.9 470.7 Accumulated impairment losses amortisation At 1 January 2006 Impairment losses for the year Amortisation charge for the year 0.3 0.3 At 1 January 2007 0.3 0.3 Impairment losses for the year utilisation of strategic land holdings 2.4 2.4 Amortisation charge for the year 0.2 0.2 At 31 December 2007 2.4 0.5 2.9 Carrying amount At 31 December 2007 406.4 60.0 1.4 467.8 At 31 December 2006 408.8 60.0 1.6 470.4 Goodwill brought forward of 182.0m arose on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs and is retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts, subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
50m of this amount 2006: 50m represents the brand value of Charles Church, acquired with Beazer Group plc in 2001.
Acquired brand values are calculated based on discounted cash flows and are tested annually for impairment.
The remainder of goodwill is allocated to acquired strategic land holdings and is tested annually for impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the intangibles are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for value in use calculations are those regarding discount and growth rates.
Growth rates incorporate volume, selling price and direct cost changes.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts, derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management, and extrapolated for four years to form the basis of the Groups five year business plan.
The growth rates therein vary between nil and 2%.
After this period, the growth rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are no more than 2% and do not exceed the long term average growth rates for the industry.
Management used pre-tax discount factors between 7.5% and 9.5% over the forecast period.
The goodwill allocated to acquired strategic land holdings is further tested by reference to the proportion of legally completed plots in the period compared to the total plots which are expected to receive satisfactory planning permission in the remaining strategic land holdings, taking account of historic experience and market conditions.
The effect of testing goodwill for impairment in the manner set out is that the goodwill will be completely impaired once the final plot, that management expects to receive a satisfactory planning permission, is sold.

Excepting finance leases all borrowings are unsecured.
The carrying value of borrowings equates to the face value of borrowings with the exception of finance leases.
The repayment terms of borrowings are as follows: Nominal Year of 2007 2006 Currency interest rate maturity m m Bank overdrafts GBP Base 1% 2008 50.9 3.0 Syndicated loan GBP LIBOR 0.35%-0.55% 2010 75.0 UK senior loan notes GBP 5.09%-7.58% 2008-2021 77.6 103.8 US senior loan notes USD 5.10%-8.28% 2008-2016 442.7 450.7 EU senior loan notes EUR 3.77% 2011 3.7 3.4 Other loan notes GBP LIBOR 0.5% 2011 5.3 17.8 Finance lease obligations GBP 7.00%-9.00% 2008-2011 3.5 3.2 Face value of borrowings 658.7 581.9 Future finance charges on finance leases 0.3 0.3 Carrying value of borrowings 658.4 581.6 Hedges have been taken out against all foreign currency denominated borrowings to hedge all principal payments to Sterling and to hedge foreign currency forward interest payments into Sterling payments at either fixed rates or rates linked to UK LIBOR.
These hedges therefore form both a hedge of foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk.
Additional data on the maturity of financial liabilities and effective interest rates after consideration of these hedges is found in note 21.

21 Financial risk management The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Liquidity risk Credit risk This note presents basic information regarding the Groups exposure to these risks and the Groups objectives, strategy and processes for measuring and managing exposure to these.
Unless otherwise stated references to Group should be considered to apply to the Company as well.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for risk management of the Group.
The Board has established the Risk Committee which has the delegated task of overseeing the Boards responsibility with respect to risk and internal control.
The Risk Committee reports to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Risk Committee is supported in this task by the Group Risk management function.
The Group Risk function performs an annual assessment of the risks faced by the Group.
This assessment is used to drive a risk focused programme of work aimed to improve business processes and increase internal control effectiveness.
Further discussion of the role of the Risk Committee and Group Risk function may be found within the Corporate Governance report on page 49.
Market risk Market risk represents the potential for changes in foreign exchange prices and interest rates to affect the Groups profit and the value of its financial instruments.
It also incorporates the effect of the overall UK housing market on the Group.
The Groups objective in market risk management is to minimize its exposures to fluctuations within such variables whilst optimising returns.
The Group has entered into a number of hedge derivative arrangements to limit its exposure to these risks, particularly exchange risk.
The Group enters into such transactions only as part of periodic wider refinancing undertakings to take advantage of the mature private placement markets in other countries notably the USA and only with the approval of the Board of Directors.
The Group applies hedge accounting to these arrangements in order to minimise profit and loss volatility.
Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 72 21 Financial risk management continued Currency risk The Groups currency risk principally resides in senior loan notes issued in US Dollars and Euros to institutional investors.
The Group has entered into hedge arrangements for all such loan notes swapping them into Sterling on issue.
These hedges match the contractual maturity of all principal payments and also match foreign currency contractual interest payment maturities, swapping these to either fixed Sterling payments designated cash flow hedges or Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR designated fair value hedges.
In this manner the Groups foreign currency senior loan notes cash flows are effectively hedged to mirror those of either a fixed or floating rate Sterling denominated loan.
The Group also has investments in a number of Portuguese jointly controlled entities.
These interests are not hedged.
These investments are considered to be long term in nature.
The Group has no other significant currency exposures.
The following exchange rates applied during the year: 2007 2006 Average Year end Average Year end rate spot rate rate spot rate US Dollar 2.002 2.004 1.840 1.959 Euro 1.462 1.362 1.467 1.484 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk may be summarised as follows: 2007 2006 USD Euro USD Euro $m bm $m am Investments 3.7 2.2 Senior loan notes 838.4 5.0 882.6 5.0 Forward exchange contracts 838.4 5.0 882.6 5.0 Net exposure 3.7 2.2 Sensitivity analysis The hedging arrangements in place over borrowings are such that the Groups profit will be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation in exchange rate at the reporting date 2006: nil.
Interest rate risk The Group holds a mixture of both fixed and floating interest borrowings to control its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group has no formal target for a ratio of fixed:floating funding.
The responsibility for setting the level of fixed rate debt lies with the Board of Directors and is continually reviewed in the light of economic data provided by a variety of sources.
Fixed rate borrowings are achieved by issuance of fixed rate GBP denominated senior loan notes and by interest rate swaps entered into as part of the hedging arrangements put in place for foreign currency denominated senior loan notes detailed under currency risk above.
A number of derivative instruments were acquired with Westbury Plc in 2006.
These instruments were not designated as hedges.
All such instruments were cancelled in 2006.
The interest expense associated with these instruments is nil 2006: 0.2m.
It is generally accepted that UK house prices are influenced by the prevailing interest rate, insofar as this in turn dictates the availability and cost of borrowings for house purchasers.
The economic link between these two factors cannot be absolutely determined nor reliably modelled however, and therefore this has been excluded from this sensitivity analysis.
Sensitivity analysis The Groups hedging arrangements are such that the Groups profit would be unaffected by any reasonably expected variation of the interest rate at the balance sheet date 2006: nil.
Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 73 21 Financial risk management continued Market risk The Group is fundamentally affected by the level of UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as employment levels, interest rates, supply of land with planning and consumer confidence.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to mitigate such risks on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor its geographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance its investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups strategy to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid funds to meet all its potential liabilities as they fall due, including anticipated shareholder distributions.
This is true not only of normal market conditions but also of negative projections against expected outcomes, so as to avoid any risk of incurring contractual penalties or damaging the Groups reputation, which would in turn reduce the Groups ability to borrow at optimal rates.
The nature of the land market in which the Group operates is such that it may, from time to time, require short notice access to significant funds to enable it to take advantage of large scale purchasing opportunities as and when they arise.
For this purpose the Group generally maintains significant available credit lines.
The Group has entered into a number of deferred payment guarantees and performance bonds in the normal course of operations.
The liabilities to which these guarantees relate are recognised and accounted for in accordance with our standard accounting policies.
Liquidity forecasts are produced on a daily basis, to ensure that utilisation of current facilities is optimised: a monthly basis, to ensure that covenant compliance targets and medium-term liquidity is maintained: and a long-term projection basis, for the purpose of identifying long term strategic funding requirements.
The Directors also continually assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group.
They consider the security of capital funding against the potentially higher rates of return offered by debt financing in order to set an efficient but stable balance appropriate to the size of the Group.
The Group operates short-term uncommitted overdraft facilities of over 160m to meet day-to-day liquidity requirements.
These facilities are cancellable on request from the bank, however the Group generally maintains low levels of borrowing on these, in favour of more cost efficient facilities.
These overdraft facilities are provided by six leading clearing banks to minimise exposure to any one lender.
The Group has a syndicated revolving credit facility committed to November 2010, at a competitive rate linked to LIBOR.
Undrawn facilities at the reporting date amount to 725.0m 2006: 800.0m.
These facilities are considered adequate to meet all the Groups cash flow requirements for the foreseeable future, excepting the potential impact of extreme circumstances that may not be reasonably anticipated terrorism, natural disasters etc.
Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 74 21 Financial risk management continued The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments not discounted.
In the vast majority of cases the full cash receipt for each sale occurs on legal completion, which is also the point of revenue recognition under the Groups accounting policies.
In certain specific circumstances the Group has entered into shared equity arrangements with individuals or investors not applicable to the Company.
In such cases the long-term debt is secured upon the property concerned the Group does not recognise collateral rights as a separate asset, nor does it have rights to trade such collateral.
Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 76 21 Financial risk management continued The maximum total credit risk is as follows: 2007 2006 Group m m Loans and receivables 95.3 95.2 Cash and cash equivalents 2.1 18.9 97.4 114.1 Company Loans and receivables including intercompany balances 246.9 562.6 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 246.9 563.1 The maximum credit exposure of the Group to overseas parties is 0.5m 2006: 0.9m Company nil 2006: nil.
The Groups credit risk is widely distributed.
The maximum credit risk should any single party fail to perform is 4.6m 2006: 4.6m Company 114.7m 2006: 310.9m being a subsidiary debtor.
This Group debtor is secured upon property.
The Directors consider these financial assets to be of high quality and the credit risk is assessed as low.
Fair value The fair value of financial assets and liabilities is as follows: 2007 2006 Fair Carrying Fair Carrying value value value value Group m m m m Trade and other receivables 95.3 95.3 95.2 95.2 Cash and cash equivalents 2.1 2.1 18.9 18.9 Bank overdrafts 50.9 50.9 3.0 3.0 Syndicated loan 75.0 75.0 UK senior loan notes 81.3 77.6 107.8 103.8 US senior loan notes 450.9 442.7 466.9 450.7 EU senior loan notes 3.7 3.7 3.4 3.4 Other loan notes 5.3 5.3 17.8 17.8 Finance lease obligations 3.2 3.2 2.9 2.9 Trade and other payables 469.3 469.3 426.6 426.6 Land payables 319.5 319.5 319.8 319.8 Forward currency swaps 68.0 68.0 101.5 101.5 1,429.7 1,417.8 1,335.6 1,315.4 Unrecognised loss 11.9 20.2 Persimmon Plc Notes to the financial statements 77 21 Financial risk management continued 2007 2006 Fair Carrying Fair Carrying value value value value Company m m m m Trade and other receivables 246.9 246.9 562.6 562.6 Cash and cash equivalents 0.5 0.5 Bank overdrafts 67.4 67.4 76.6 76.6 Syndicated loan 75.0 75.0 UK senior loan notes 57.7 54.6 58.4 55.8 US senior loan notes 223.6 223.6 236.0 226.0 EU senior loan notes 3.7 3.7 3.4 3.4 Other loan notes 5.3 5.3 6.6 6.6 Finance lease obligations 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Trade and other payables 2,787.5 2,787.5 2,560.3 2,560.3 Forward currency swaps 18.6 18.6 34.3 34.3 2,992.9 2,989.8 2,413.5 2,400.9 Unrecognised loss 3.1 12.6 Income and expense in relation to financial instruments is disclosed in note 8.

Where no such price is readily available then fair value is determined by discounting net forward cash flows for the residual period of the contract by a risk free rate.
Hedge accounting As outlined under currency risk above the Group operates two forms of hedging.
Certain US senior loan notes, along with all EU senior loan notes, are hedged using fair value hedges.
These hedge instruments effectively swap fixed US Dollar Euro interest payments for floating Sterling payments linked to UK LIBOR.
They also provide a forward swap for all capital repayments.
Thus these instruments effectively hedge foreign exchange risk.
Other US senior loan notes are hedged via cash flow hedges.
These hedge instruments effectively swap fixed US Dollar Euro interest payments for fixed Sterling payments.
Thus these instruments effectively hedge both foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The periods when the forecast cash flows relating to cash flow hedges will occur, and when they will affect profit are as follows: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Less than 1 year 8.1 6.7 2.7 1-2 years 1.0 9.9 2.8 2-5 years 17.4 48.4 17.9 Over 5 years 36.5 10.9 Carrying value 26.5 101.5 34.3 There was no hedge ineffectiveness during the period.
