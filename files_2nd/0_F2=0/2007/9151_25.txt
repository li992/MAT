62 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Estimated impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.
See note 12 for further information.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each territory.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts which were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period to which such determination is made.
See notes 9 and 27 for further information.
Post employment benefits The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds.
The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
See note 28 for further information.
Restructuring provision The Group provided 205.3m in the prior year relating to the closure and downsizing of stores in B&Q UK and the termination of the B&Q UK financial services arrangement as detailed in note 5.
During the year the Group utilised 28.8m of this provision against the related costs.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and sub-letting the surplus space released from those stores to be downsized, as detailed in note 29.

The differences are explained below: millions 2007 2006 Profit before tax 450.5 231.8 Profit multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2006: 30% 135.2 69.5 Effects of: Share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures 5.1 3.4 Expenses not taxable deductible for tax purposes 8.8 30.3 Losses not recognised 0.2 10.7 Foreign tax rate differences 2.1 6.8 Adjustments in respect of prior years attributable to change in tax rates 11.5 21.1 112.1 92.8 In addition to the amounts charged to the income statement, tax of 30.1m 2006: 20.1 m was charged credited directly to equity see notes 27 and 31.
A tax credit of 7.3m has been recognised in the income statement relating to exceptional items, of which 4.6m is credited against the current year tax charge in relation to the 49.5m net exceptional income, with the remaining 2.7m in respect of prior periods, relating to tax previously provided on exceptional items.
Kingfisher paid 137.5m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
Proceedings for the recovery of this tax have been initiated and although this may take several years to be resolved, Kingfisher believes that the risk of ultimately being liable for this amount is low.
No asset has been recognised in these accounts as the recovery of this amount is not sufficiently certain at this time.
In certain circumstances, it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals in the year to 31 January 2004 could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be significant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year.
Adjusted earnings per share figures are also presented.
These exclude the effects of exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, to allow comparison of underlying trading performance on a consistent basis.

Fair value is taken to be the open market value at the date of valuation.
All property acquired from 1 February 2004 is carried at cost.
Included in land and buildings is leasehold land in the UK, China, Poland and Russia.
This leasehold land is in effect a prepayment for the use of land and is accordingly being amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
72 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 14 Property, plant and equipment continued The cost and accumulated depreciation of leasehold land included in land and buildings at 3 February 2007 was 253.8m and 44.6m 2006: 260.9m and 39.0m respectively.
If the Group had continued to revalue properties after transition to IFRS, the value of the properties as at 3 February 2007 would have been 3,136.5m 2006: 2,984.9m.
The values are based on valuations performed by external qualified valuers.
The key assumption used in calculating this is the estimated yields.
The average income yields used were 5.5% in the UK, 6.7% in France and Italy, 6.8% in Poland and 7.7% in China.

The directors consider that the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables approximate to their fair values.
In addition, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated and therefore no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.

Both bank loans and overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Non-current bank loans include a 50m term loan maturing in February 2009, which bears an interest rate based on LIBOR fixed for periods up to six months.
The remaining bank loans are arranged at fixed rates of interest which have an average maturity of three years and an effective interest rate of 4.1% 2006: 5.0%.
The fixed rate loans expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.

The US Private Placement contains a covenant requiring that, as at the end of each semi-annual and annual financial reporting period, the ratio of operating profit to net finance costs, as defined in the contract, should not be less than 3.00 to 1.00 for the preceding 12 month period.
76 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 22 Borrowings continued Finance lease commitments The Group leases certain of its buildings and fixtures and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term maturity for buildings is nine years and for fixtures and equipment is two years.
Building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows: 2007 2006 Present Minimum Present Minimum value of payments value of payments millions payments payments Within one year 8.7 14.1 3.7 9.0 After one year but not more than five years 21.6 38.4 23.9 49.2 After five years 39.3 62.7 44.3 71.3 Total minimum lease payments 69.6 115.2 71.9 129.5 Less amounts representing finance charges 45.6 57.6 Present value of minimum lease payments 69.6 71.9 The interest rate inherent in the finance leases is fixed at the contract date for all of the lease term and therefore exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The effective interest rate on the Groups finance leases is 8.7% 2006: 8.7%.
Fair value of borrowings The directors consider that the carrying amounts of current bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases approximate to their fair values.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair value of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The carrying amounts and fair values of the non-current borrowings are as follows: 2007 2006 Carrying Fair values Carrying Fair values millions amounts amounts Bank loans 64.2 64.2 63.5 64.2 Medium Term Notes and other fixed term debt 1,306.6 1,327.1 1,123.8 1,134.6 Obligations under finance leases 60.9 67.7 68.2 83.3 1,431.7 1,459.0 1,255.5 1,282.1 23 Borrowing facilities At 3 February 2007 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available: millions 2007 2006 Expiring within one year Expiring after one year but not more than two years Expiring after two years 500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0 The Group has access to a 500m committed revolving credit facility, maturing in August 2011, provided by a number of banks.
This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes of the Group including working capital requirements.
In March 2006, the Group obtained a further 300m committed bank facility, which provided short-term funding, but this was subsequently repaid and cancelled with the proceeds of the $466.5m US Private Placement in May 2006.
Since the year end, the Group has entered into new committed revolving credit facilities, totalling 275m, with a number of banks, and a 25m bank committed term loan facility.
These new facilities mature in March 2010 and are available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes of the Group.

The directors consider that the carrying amounts of trade and other payables approximate to their fair values.
25 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk arising from financing, the purchase of inventories in foreign currencies and net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
In addition the Group uses inflation derivatives to hedge the risk associated with certain property lease contracts.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by discounting the future cash flows arising from the instrument using market rates.
At the balance sheet date the fair values were: 2007 2006 millions Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Current Cash flow hedges 0.6 4.7 2.6 0.5 Net investment hedges 4.6 Non-designated hedges 4.5 0.3 0.1 3.8 9.7 5.0 2.7 4.3 Non-current Net investment hedges 14.2 4.7 1.8 Fair value hedges 14.7 35.8 27.2 3.8 Non-designated hedges 9.8 28.9 45.6 31.9 5.6 Total derivative financial instruments 38.6 50.6 34.6 9.9 Cash flow hedges Foreign currency cash flow risk arises from the purchase of inventories in foreign currencies.
This risk is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts to match committed, and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months.
At 3 February 2007 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 157.8m 2006: 128.0m.
The associated fair value gains and losses will be transferred to inventories when the purchases occur over the next 12 months.
Losses of 3.1m 2006: 0.5m have been transferred to inventories for contracts which matured during the year see note 31.
Net investment hedges The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge part of the currency exposure arising from its overseas investments.
At 3 February 2007 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 295.3m 2006: 308.5m.
Fair value hedges The Group is exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk.
Interest rate swaps have been transacted which convert fixed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme to a floating rate liability.
During the year the Group issued a $466.5m US Private Placement which has been swapped to a floating Sterling liability.
At 3 February 2007 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 1,233.9m 2006: 1,020.2m.
78 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 07 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Derivative financial instruments continued The Group is exposed to inflation risk in certain property lease contracts.
During the year an inflation swap was transacted to limit the impact of inflation on some of these contracts.
This derivative, which limits the annual inflation uplift on the underlying lease payments at 3% each year until April 2021, has been hedge accounted as a fair value hedge of unrecognised future commitments.
At 3 February 2007 the Sterling notional amount of such contracts was 10.5m.
Non-designated hedges The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge of fluctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 3 February 2007 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 424.2m 2006: 412.4m.
These have not been hedge accounted, since the fair value movements of the derivatives in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet positions.
These include a forward foreign exchange contract hedging part of the funding of the Groups overseas operations, a cross-currency swap converting a euro-denominated debt into a Sterling liability and short-term FX swap contracts.
The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives which are required to be accounted for separately if they do not meet certain criteria.
The Group does not have embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract.
26 Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities The maturity, interest rate and currency profiles of financial assets and liabilities are presented below.
The maturity profile is based on the timing of cash flows.
The interest rate and currency profiles are presented after taking into account the effects of hedging instruments.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 24.8m 2006: 4.5m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 130.6m 2006: 74.6m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China and South Korea of 55.2m 2006: 53.2m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 17.8m 2006: 13.2m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Earnings which could be remitted, on which there would be tax to pay, total 127.3m 2006: 125.2m.
On 22 March 2007 the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28% from April 2008.
Based on a 28% UK corporation tax rate the deferred tax liability would reduce by less than 10m.
No adjustment has been made for this change.
28 Post employment benefits The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
The most significant are the funded, final salary defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees: however various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are operated in France, Poland, Italy, China and South Korea.
In France and Poland, they are retirement indemnity in nature: and in South Korea and Italy, termination indemnity in nature.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes, at rates specified in the individual plans rules, are as follows: millions 2007 2006 Defined contribution schemes note 8 2.6 3.7 Defined benefit schemes Balance sheet obligations: millions 2007 2006 Defined benefit liabilities 54.6 239.6 The amount of the defined benefit obligation at 3 February 2007 which relates to funded defined benefit schemes is 46.7m 2006: 232.0m.

The principal actuarial assumptions and expected rates of return used were as follows: 2007 2006 Annual % rate UK Other UK Other Discount rate 5.3 4.6 to 5.5 4.7 4.0 to 6.0 Salary escalation 4.5 3.5 to 6.7 4.3 2.0 to 6.7 Rate of pension increases 2.9 n a 2.7 n a Price inflation 2.9 2.0 to 2.5 2.7 2.0 to 2.5 2007 2006 % rate of return UK Other UK Other Equities 7.8 7.6 Bonds 4.9 4.5 4.2 Property 6.3 5.9 Other 3.9 4.0 3.7 4.0 Overall expected rate of return 6.5 4.0 6.1 4.0 The overall expected rate of return is effectively a weighted average of the individual asset categories and their inherent expected rates of return.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 30.0m, and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 1.0m.
The assumptions for pensioner longevity are based on an analysis of pensioner death trends under the scheme over the period from 1998 to 2004, together with allowances for future improvements to death rates for all members.
The specific tables used are the same as those used in the 2004 funding valuation, namely PMA92C2010 for male pensioners, PFA92C2010 2 year age rating for female pensioners.
Further allowances for improving longevity are included for members yet to retire.
At 3 February 2007 the Group has further strengthened the assumption for future improvements to mortality rates implying an increase in the assumed life expectancies.
This has the impact of increasing the defined benefit obligation by 4% compared with that using the previous mortality rate projections.
These revised assumptions are equivalent to assuming the average age at death for a pensioner currently aged 60 is 85.1 for a male and 86.3 for a female.
They are also equivalent to assuming an average age at death for a member aged 60 in 15 years time is 86.2 for a male and 87.5 for a female.
These assumptions will be reviewed following the next funding valuation due no later than as at 31 March 2007.

The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
This excludes idle properties related to the B&Q UK restructuring programme which are included in the B&Q restructuring provision.
The B&Q restructuring provision represents the estimated cost of the B&Q UK store and head office restructuring programme.
This provision has been discounted to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the specific liabilities.
The provision is expected to be utilised over the next two to three years.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and sub-letting the surplus space released from those stores to be downsized.
