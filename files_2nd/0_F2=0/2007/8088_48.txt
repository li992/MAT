The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances after offset for Balance Sheet purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liability 293,151 244,320 Deferred tax asset 31,835 19,900 261,316 224,420 At 31 December 2007, the Group has unused tax losses of 11,486,000 2006: nil available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 3,216,000 2006: nil, has been recognised in respect of these losses.
At the Balance Sheet date, the aggregate amount of post acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 394,211,000 2006: 226,500,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.
