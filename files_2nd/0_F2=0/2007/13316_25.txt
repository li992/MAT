SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The company has share option schemes for approximately 500 senior executives worldwide.
The exercise price for share options is the mid-market closing price immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share options are equity settled.
Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are three levels of qualication under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of ination.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of ination.
Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a dened group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in a group of support services companies.
Deferred share schemes: shares have been offered to executive directors and divisional managing directors to compensate for loss of bonuses or share options in their previous employment on joining the group during 2005.
Deferred shares are awarded to members based upon being in continued employment at the time of meeting the various grant dates in the future.
As at 31 December 2007, 4.5m shares have been granted in respect of the deferred share scheme and 532,174 shares have been issued to members during the financial year then ended.
Refer to the remuneration report on pages 59 to 64 for details of the chief executives and chief financial ofcers share awards.
Movements in the number of share options outstanding and their related weighted average exercise prices are as follows: Weighted average Number exercise of share price options p per share 000 Outstanding at 1 January 2006 206.230 38,844 Granted Exercised 156.493 593 Expired 215.406 6,336 Outstanding at 31 December 2006 205.333 31,915 Granted Exercised 155.448 398 Expired 217.602 6,692 Outstanding at 31 December 2007 202.825 24,825 Out of the 24.8m outstanding options, 6,786,045 options were exercisable at a weighted average price of 266.285p per share.

For 75% of the TSR portion of an award, performance is measured by comparing the companys relative TSR performance to that of constituents of the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies.
For the remaining 25% of the TSR portion of an award, the companys TSR performance is measured against the constituents of an international group of support services companies.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The fair value of the above awards is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived using an option pricing tool which is a closed-form solution operating on similar principles to a Monte Carlo simulation.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 148.25p for 6 March 2007 grants and 163p for 30 March 2007 grants, an expected share price volatility of 22%, an expected life of three years i. e. commensurate with the vesting period and an expected correlation of 23% and 23% for the respective comparator groups.
The share price volatility and the correlation assumptions are based on statistical analysis of historical daily share prices.
As participants are entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period, the expected dividend yield and the assumed risk-free rate of return have no impact on the fair value of the awards.
The total net charge for the year relating to equity-settled share-based payment plans was 2.2m 2006: nil.

In addition to the synergies above, the goodwill which arose from the premium paid for Technivap represents the potential benets and synergies available to the group in introducing the services provided by the business to the groups existing customers in other geographic markets in which it operates.
A proportion of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Presto-X and Campbell Bros represents premiums paid by the group to expand its presence in the US and Australian pest control markets, allowing the group to benefit from further potential synergies available through more acquisitions and integration of smaller pest control businesses in these markets.
The goodwill attributable to the Lancaster acquisition represents the premium paid to establish a presence in a geographic segment of the UK market and to benefit from further integration synergies available to the group.
Further goodwill is attributable to the workforce in all of the acquired businesses.
