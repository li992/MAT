Share repurchase transactions in respect of 55,719,000 shares carried out between 19 May 2006 and 21 February 2007 took place at a time when ARM Holdings plc Company only had no distributable reserves and accordingly such shares have not been properly acquired in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, and are not available for re-issue or cancellation.
ARM Holdings plc made an application to the Court during 2007 to cancel these shares pursuant to a special resolution passed at the 2007 AGM.
At 31 December 2007, a total of 65.2 million shares 2006: no shares were held as Treasury stock: no shares 2006: 49.5 million shares were held for cancellation: and 1.2 million shares 2006: 1.2 million shares were held within the ESOP.
At 31 December 2007, own shares held have a nominal value of 0.05 pence 2006: 0.05 pence and in total represent 4.9% 2006: 3.6% of called-up share capital.
22 Acquisitions There were no acquisitions during 2007.
Falanx Microsystems AS On 30 May 2006, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Falanx Microsystems AS Falanx, a graphics IP company incorporated in Norway for total consideration of 13.4 million, comprising 13.3 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
This purchase has been accounted for as an acquisition.
Falanx develops graphics accelerator IP and software for semiconductor system-on-chip SoC vendors that deliver high-quality multimedia images without compromising performance, power consumption or system cost.
The acquisition ts the ARM strategy of enabling users to create SoCs seamlessly in their design process.
The Mali Graphics Processor Unit GPU is a combination of hardware and software that enables industry-leading 3D graphics and video on mobile phones, portable media players, set-top boxes, handheld gaming devices and automotive systems, providing the Group with full control over the development of its future 3D graphics solutions.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Falanx and synergistic benets that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Falanx acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill in the financial statements.
At 31 December 2006, the accounting for the Falanx acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
At 31 December 2007, final adjustments to these provisional values were recognised as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
These adjustments were recognised as if they had occurred at the date of acquisition.

As a result, goodwill increased by 17,000 during the year.
Consideration satisfied by: 000 Cash consideration paid 13,280 Expenses 130 13,410 The outow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of Falanx is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid 13,280 Expenses paid 130 Cash acquired 24 Net cash outow 13,386 The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Falanx can be analysed as follows: 000 Computer software 2 Developed technology 4,267 Customer relationships 990 Total 5,259 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identiable intangible assets are described below: Developed technology Developed technology of 4.3 million comprises internally-developed software and hardware technologies.
Falanx employs a number of unique pieces of software that have been internally developed, allowing them to be highly bespoke and continually adapted.
Internally developed hardware technologies comprise the Mali family of graphics processors which are controlled by Falanx through numerous patents.
At the date of acquisition, both internally-developed software and hardware technologies were complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to ongoing maintenance of the technologies and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the internally-developed software the replacement cost approach was used with a post-tax discount rate of 14.9%.
To estimate the fair value of the internally-developed hardware, a discounted cash ow method, specically the income approach, was used with a post-tax discount rate of 15.4%.
Developed technologies are being amortised over an estimated useful life of three to five years.
Customer relationships The customer base of 1.0 million represented the fair value of existing customer contracts.
To estimate their fair value, a discounted cash ow method, specically the income approach, was used with reference to the terms of the contracts and managements estimates of the level of revenue which will be generated from the customer relationships.
A post-tax discount rate of 14.9% was used for the valuation.
Customer relationships are being amortised over an estimated useful life of three years.
84 ARM Holdings plc 22 Acquisitions continued Soisic SA acquisition On 30 October 2006, the Group purchased the entire share capital of Soisic SA Soisic, a silicon-on-insulator SOI IP company incorporated in France for total consideration of 5.8 million, comprising 3.1 million cash consideration, 2.4 million contingent consideration and 0.3 million of related acquisition expenses.
With this acquisition, the Group is making an investment in new technologies related to physical IP to enhance its leadership position in providing customers access to the higher performance and lower power offered by SOI process technologies.
Soisic develops a similar set of products to the Physical IP Division, specically standard cells, static random access memory SRAM compilers and input output I O cells, however, based on SOI design rules and process models.
Integrating this capability with ARMs widely-used physical IP opens the possibility for SoC designers to access SOI technology, which currently is used only in full custom designs, such as high-performance microprocessors.
The Group is investing in this area to be at the forefront of the design technologies needed to exploit the potential advantages of SOI as its usage grows in mobile, home and enterprise SoC and ASIC applications.
For the reasons given above, combined with the ability to hire the entire workforce of Soisic and synergistic benets that may arise, the Group paid a premium on the Soisic acquisition, giving rise to goodwill.
At 31 December 2006, the accounting for the Soisic acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
At 31 December 2007, a final adjustment was made to these provisional values as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired.
This adjustment related to pre-acquisition losses from which the Group expects to derive future tax benets and was recognised as if it had occurred at the date of acquisition.

The contingent consideration will be determined based on Soisics future revenue in the first 1.5 years post-acquisition.
The outow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisition of Soisic is calculated as follows: 000 Cash consideration paid excluding net debt of 22,000 1,821 Expenses paid 300 Bank overdraft acquired 53 Net cash outow 2,174 ARM Holdings plc 85 Notes to the financial statements IFRS continued 22 Acquisitions continued The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Soisic can be analysed as follows: 000 Developed technology 4,283 Total 4,283 The methods and significant assumptions involved in valuing these identiable intangible assets are described below: Developed technology Developed technology of 4.3 million represents primarily SOI wafers from 16nm up to 65nm.
At the date of acquisition the technology was complete and had reached technological feasibility.
Any costs incurred in the future will relate to the ongoing maintenance of the technology and will be expensed as incurred.
To estimate the fair value of the technology, a discounted cash ow method, specically the excess profit method, was used with a post-tax discount rate of 30%.
Developed technology is being amortised over an estimated useful life of five years.
PowerEscape Inc. On 21 June 2006, the Group purchased certain assets of PowerEscape Inc. a private company incorporated in the US, for total consideration of 0.6 million, comprising 0.5 million cash consideration and 0.1 million of related acquisition expenses.
The PowerEscape team, which has been integrated into the Groups Systems Design Division, will focus on adding innovative proling and analysis features to the Groups portfolio of market-leading development tools.
No goodwill has been recognised on this acquisition.
At 31 December 2006, the accounting for the PowerEscape acquisition was determined on a provisional basis because the fair values assigned to the acquirees identiable assets and liabilities were only provisional.
At 31 December 2007, no adjustments to these provisional values were recognised as a result of completing work on the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired and so these provisional values became the final fair values for the assets and liabilities acquired.
