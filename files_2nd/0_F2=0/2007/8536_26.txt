The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 1.
These financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
In addition the following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are mandatory for the year ending 30 September 2007, and these have been adopted but have had no impact on the 2007 Group financial statements: Amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Shares Transactions The following new interpretations have been issued which are not applicable to the Group since they are only effective for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2007.
These are also not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements: IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements IFIRC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction Basis of accounting ITE Group plc is a UK listed Company and, together with its subsidiary operations, is hereafter referred to as the Group.
The Company is required to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Reporting Standards IFRS as endorsed by the European Union.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses.
These estimates and associated assumptions are based on past experience and other factors considered applicable at the time and are used to make judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that cannot be readily determined from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
These estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Changes to estimates and assumptions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are made.
The statements are presented in pounds Sterling and have been prepared under IFRS using the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of ITE Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings controlled by the Company drawn up to 30 September each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
ITE Group plc 46 Annual Report 2007 Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for resale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit, pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill on acquisition of a foreign entity is treated as an asset of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as sterling denominated assets.
Intangible assets Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists are measured initially at purchase cost.
Computer software, trademarks, brands and customer lists have a definite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost over their estimated useful life.
The estimated useful lives are typically between three and five years.
Impairment of assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets are impaired.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
ITE Group plc 47 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment is recognised immediately as an expense.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Leasehold improvements term of lease Fixture and fittings 10 years Plant and equipment 4 years Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets, or where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying value amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has a significant influence but not control or joint control.
In the Group accounts the results and assets and liabilities of associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment.
The consolidated income statement includes the Groups share of associates profits less losses.
The share of profits of associates included in the income statement is the net profit after interest, tax and minority interests of the associate.
Losses of associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill within the Groups investment in associates.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Venue advances Where the Group has advanced funds to venue owners that can be repaid by either off-setting against future venue hire or by cash repayment, the fair value is recognised based on the discounted value of future cash receipts.
The loan balance is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Advances that are prepayments of future venue hire and do not permit the repayment of the principal in cash are recognised at cost as prepayments in venue advances and prepayments.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
ITE Group plc 48 Annual Report 2007 Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
The Group adopted IAS 39 and IAS 32 with effect from 1 October 2005 and consequently restated the balance sheet at that date in accordance with the requirements of these standards.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are measured at initial recognition at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Where bank overdrafts are deemed to be integral to the Groups cash management activities, they are presented within net cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
Overdrafts that are considered to be financing in nature are presented as financing activities in the cash flow statement.
Hedging instruments The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to hedge these exposures.
Derivative instruments are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as effective fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement, along with any changes in fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk.
Any ineffective portion is also recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the period.
The Groups use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups financial policies.
Further details on these policies can be found in the Business review on pages 23 to 24.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the ordinary course of business net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue and profit is recognised over the course of an event.
Billings and cash received in advance, and directly attributable costs relating to future events are deferred.
The amounts so deferred are included in the balance sheet as deferred event income and prepaid event costs respectively.
Losses anticipated at the balance sheet date are provided in full.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Barter transactions Where barter transactions occur between advertising and exhibition space and the revenue can be measured reliably, revenues and costs are recognised in the income statement.
ITE Group plc 49 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Operating profit Operating profit is stated after the share of results of associates and profit or loss on disposal of Group undertakings and before investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that does not affect the tax profit or the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying value of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or their contractual rate where applicable.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the rate prevailing at the date the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains or losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Details of the Groups accounting polices for forward contracts and options are included in the policy on derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transaction are used.
Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Under the exemption permitted from IAS 21 the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations prior to 1 October 2004 have been treated as zero.
Consequently, any gain or loss on disposal will exclude translation differences that arose prior to 1 October 2004.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
ITE Group plc 50 Annual Report 2007 Employee Share Trust The financial statements include the assets and liabilities of the Employee Share Trust ESOT.
Shares in the Company held by the ESOT have been valued at cost and are held in equity.
The costs of administration of the ESOT are written off to profit or loss as incurred.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, any net consideration received is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
Share-based payments The Group has applied IFRS 2 share-based payment.
IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured using a Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations based on managements best estimate.
Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Benefits received as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the following judgements and assumptions have been made by management and have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements or have the most risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year: Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill and intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of cash-generating units to which goodwill or intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimation of future cash flows expected from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets at 30 September 2007 is 34.4 million and 4.3 million respectively.
Intangible assets The valuation of intangible assets requires management to estimate the net present value of the additional future cash flows arising from customer relationships and trademarks to determine the value of those intangible assets.
This involves estimating the period over which the customer relationships and trademarks affect future cash flows.
Share-based payments The Group makes share-based payments to certain employees.
These payments are measured at their estimated fair value at the date of grant, calculated using an appropriate option pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
The key assumptions used in calculating the fair value of the options are the discount rate, the Groups share price volatility, dividend yield, risk free rate of return, and expected option lives.
Management regularly performs a true-up of the estimate of the number of shares that are expected to vest: this is dependent on the anticipated number of leavers.
Taxation Being a multinational Group with tax affairs in many geographic locations inherently leads to a tax structure which makes the degree of estimation and judgement more challenging.
The resolution of issues is not always within the control of the Group and is often dependent on the efficiency of legal processes.
Such issues can take several years to resolve.
The Group however takes a considered view of unresolved issues, however the inherent uncertainty regarding these items means that the eventual resolution could differ significantly from the accounting estimates and therefore impact the Groups results and future cash flows.

10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 UK & Western Europe 10,763 10,740 Central Asia & Caucasus 6,080 6,080 Russia 15,125 15,122 Eastern & Southern Europe 2,456 2,464 34,424 34,406 ITE Group plc 55 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 10 Goodwill acquired through business combinations continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the cash generating units.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based upon the most recent financial plans approved by the Board and extrapolates the planned cash flows.
Assumed growth rates of between 2% and 9% are applied for the first three years beyond the detailed plans, which rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for our business in the relevant markets, and a rate of between 2% and 3% is applied thereafter.
The discount rates applied to the cash generating units are between 10% and 13%.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from trade receivables of 0.2 million.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of other receivables approximates their fair value.
The trade receivables are held in different currencies with 1.9 million in Sterling, 2.1 million in US Dollars, 21.3 million in Euros and 1.5 million in other currencies.
The cash at bank and in hand comprises cash held by the Group and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying value of these assets approximates their fair value.
The cash balance is represented by 33.9 million of Sterling, 3.6 million of Euros, 1.3 million of US Dollars and 1.2 million of Roubles.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term deposit with floating interest rates.
As a result of the capital reduction in August 2005, 3.8 million is held in a trust account, which will be released as certain creditors are paid in full.

The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and venue advances.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are generally banks with credit ratings of A or above assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
16 Bank overdraft The bank overdrafts are all repayable on demand.
Of the total borrowing, 11.3 million 2006: 8.8 million is denominated in Euros, 2.0 million 2006: 1.9 million is denominated in US Dollars.
The borrowings are arranged at floating interest rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Euro and US Dollar borrowings are taken out to act as a partial hedge against the UK trade receivables in those currencies.
The overdraft has been secured by a guarantee between ITE Group plc, ITE Exhibitions & Conferences Limited, International Trade and Exhibitions JV Limited, ITE Overseas Limited, ITE Enterprises Limited, ITE Moda Limited and ITE Moda Footwear Limited and a charge over the account of International Trade and Exhibitions JV Limited.
The average interest rate on the bank overdrafts approximates 4.3% per annum 2006: 3.6% and is determined by reference to base rate plus 0.5%.
The Directors estimate the carrying value of the overdrafts approximates their fair value.
At 30 September 2007 the Group had 6.7 million 2006: 9.3 million of gross undrawn committed borrowing facilities.

The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 1,671 2,145 Deferred tax assets 1,690 2,022 19 123 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1.3 million 2006: 1.3 million available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses in either year due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 3.1 million 2006: 5.1 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
20 Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group is party to foreign currency forward-plus contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are denominated in Euros which represents the Groups primary billing currency.
Under the forward-plus contract, the Group has a right but not an obligation, to sell Euros for Sterling at a specified strike rate at specified dates.
However, if the spot rate is at or below the specified barrier rate on any business day during the barrier period the right to sell Euros becomes an obligation, at the specified strike rate.
As at 30 September 2007 the notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward-plus contracts that the Group has committed to are as follows: 2007 2006 e000 u000 Foreign currency forward-plus contracts 41,000 15,000 ITE Group plc 60 Annual Report 2007 The commitment of u41 million includes a u12 million obligation whereby if the barrier rate is breached, a 1.5 multiple applies to the obligation to sell Euros.
Therefore, the potential commitment if the exchange rate is below the barrier rate for the whole term of the instrument is u47 million.
This instrument has not been designated as a hedging instrument and, as such, any changes in its fair value are being recorded in the income statement.
These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the next 18 months and are renewed on a revolving basis as required, subject to not committing the Group to less than 6 months or more than 18 months in the future.
At 30 September 2007, the fair value of these derivatives is estimated to be a liability of approximately 0.6 million 2006: asset of 0.3 million.
These amounts are based on market valuations.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges amounting to 50,000 2006: 0.3 million has been deferred in equity.
Changes in the fair value of currency derivatives of 0.6 million 2006: 0.1 million arising where they are no longer designated as effective hedges have been recorded in the income statement.
The Group has taken out foreign currency overdrafts in Euros and US Dollars to act as a natural hedge against certain currency trade receivable balances.
These borrowings have not been designated as hedging instruments by management.
All foreign exchange movements on these borrowings and trade receivables are recognised directly in the income statement.
