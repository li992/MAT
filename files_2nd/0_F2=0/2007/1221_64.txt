12 Share-based compensation The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company and awards of shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
The exercise of options or vesting of share awards will be satisfied either out of newly issued share capital, or from shares held by the Company as treasury stock or within the ESOP.
Treasury stock is purchased from the market and the quantum and timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the directors, and based on the share price and short-term cash requirements of the Company.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK tax authorities, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for the Companys French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
From 2006, the Company has begun issuing Restricted Stock Units RSUs to employees instead of options as approved at the 2006 AGM.
RSUs are actual share awards on vesting rather than options to buy shares at a xed exercise price.
The main RSU awards to employees in all jurisdictions other than France vest similarly to the unapproved scheme above, namely 25% on each anniversary over four years.
RSU awards to the Companys French employees vest 50% after two years, and then a further 25% after three and four years.
Whilst the Company reserves the right to award options to employees going forward, the majority of awards to employees will be in RSUs.
Additionally from 2006, the Company introduced the Deferred Annual Bonus plan DAB.
Under the DAB, which is for directors and selected senior management within the Company, participants are required to defer 50% of any related annual bonus into shares on a compulsory basis.
These shares will be deferred for three years, and then a further matching award will be made depending on the achievement of an EPS performance condition over that time.
The Company also operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, also for directors and selected senior management, whereby share awards are made and vest depending on the Companys TSR performance compared to two comparator groups over the three-year performance period.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
The schemes assumed were the 1993 Plan, the 1997 Plan, the 2000 Plan, the 2003 Plan, the Director Plan, the Executive Plan and the ND00 Plan.
