These are principally attributable to exchange differences on the Groups non-sterling denominated currency borrowings, held in companies whose functional currency is sterling.
Of the exchange gains, 24 million arose on net external US dollar borrowings, 10 million on net external euro borrowings and 1 million on other currencies.
These foreign currency borrowings are held as an economic hedge by reference to the Groups underlying cash generation by currency.
However, they are not accounted for as net investment hedges under IAS 39 and consequently exchange differences arising on these borrowings are recorded in the income statement.

Earnings loss per share for continuing operations is also calculated by reference to earnings before exceptional items, exceptional finance costs and foreign exchange gains and losses with an underlying tax charge of 29 million 2006: 26 million, since the directors consider that this gives a useful additional indication of underlying performance.
The diluted earnings loss per share has been calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share without reference to adjustments in respect of certain share options which are considered to be anti-dilutive.
There have been no transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date of completion of these financial statements.

An analysis of the carrying amount of goodwill by primary business segment is set out below.
Certain business segments comprise a number of CGUs.
2007 2006 m m Process Systems 58 65 Eurotherm 105 111 APV 47 Rail Group 11 Controls 38 38 Continuing operations 206 222 84 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 Annual impairment test The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections over a five year period.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are: revenue volumes: revenue prices: operating costs: growth rate assumptions for years four and five of the cash flow projections: growth in perpetuity applied to calculate the terminal value: and discount rate.
Expected revenue volumes, revenue prices and operating costs are based on past experience and expected future developments in markets and operations and are the same assumptions used in the most recent financial annual operating plans approved by management.
These projections cover the first three years of the cash flow projections.
Cash flows for years four and five are projected at a growth rate appropriate for the relevant CGU.
These growth rates take into consideration forecast GDP growth rates for the countries of operation, expected market growth rates for those regions and the levels of growth achieved historically by the CGU and forecast in the periods covered by the annual operating plan.
Lower growth rates are applied in perpetuity to calculate the terminal value for each CGU.
These rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The discount rate applied to each CGU is a pre-tax rate based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect managements estimate of the specific risk profile associated with the cash flow projections for the CGU.
These discount rates and growth rates by CGU are as follows: Discount Growth Discount Growth rate rate rate rate 2007 2007 2006 2006 % %%% Process Systems IPS Sales, Operations, Customer Services and IPS Products 13.70 3.6 15.61 3.5 IPS Solutions and Services 13.70 3.0 15.61 3.1 Wonderware 13.70 3.1 15.61 3.2 Eurotherm 14.95 2.8 16.18 3.0 APV 15.97 3.1 16.95 2.7 Rail Group 15.79 2.7 16.71 2.6 Controls Appliance and Climate Controls 11.54 2.0 12.69 3.1 IMServ 12.55 1.5 13.69 1.9 Invensys Building Systems n a n a 12.69 3.1 In perpetuity.
In all cases the recoverable amounts of these CGUs were in excess of their carrying values and no impairment arose in the year 2006: nil.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With respect to the assessment of value in use of all CGUs management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of those CGUs to exceed its recoverable amount.

A deferred tax asset has not been recognised on temporary differences of 525 million with a tax value of 173 million 2006: 463 million with a tax value of 167 million in respect of pension and other retirement benefit obligations.
The Group has unrecognised capital losses of 2,144 million 2006: 2,267 million that are only available for offset against future capital gains.
Included in capital losses are losses of 1,384 million 2006: 1,765 million that will expire within four years.
Other capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 830 million 2006: 850 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets consist of investments in listed ordinary shares and therefore have no fixed maturity date or coupon rate.
Financial assets at fair value through the income statement The investments included above represent investments in unlisted euro denominated securities that offer the Group the opportunity for return through fair value gains.
The securities have final maturity dates between 2010 and 2020, with options for early redemption at set intervals linked to the level of the Nikkei Index.
Market values have been determined by external security dealers using pricing models, based on various financial factors including bond prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and the Nikkei Index prices.

These loans and borrowings are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain Group companies assets.
1 million 2006: 5 million of such loans is classified as current liabilities.
The available facilities at 31 March 2007 are 396 million 2006: 410 million of which 252 million 2006: 277 million is drawn other than as a cash advance.
The bonding facilities are only able to be drawn as cash to finance or refinance cash collateral.
The borrowers have the right to prepay these facilities on five days notice, subject to conditions in other borrowing agreements.
Prepayment is at par with payments being applied first to the two Term loans.
However, lenders have the right to decline prepayments of part but not the whole of the Term loans.

The Groups principal borrowing facilities are subject to several financial covenants.
The Group is subject to incurrence covenants which prohibit it from taking certain actions if the incurrence test is failed.
It is also subject to maintenance covenants which are tested on a regular basis.
Failure of the maintenance covenants would allow the lenders under the relevant agreement to call for immediate repayment of loans made to the Group.
Senior Notes due March 2011 These Notes carry only incurrence covenants which, if failed, restrict the ability of the Group to incur indebtedness beyond certain limits, pay dividends or make similar payments.
Senior Credit Facilities maturing 15 December 2010 to 15 January 2011 These facilities carry maintenance covenants that include a maximum ratio of debt to earnings, a minimum level of interest cover and a maximum level of capital expenditure.
The covenants measure these as a number and must show performance better than a defined scale, which changes over the period of the facilities.
To date the Group has shown ratios better than those required by the relevant agreements.

Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 91 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 22 Financial risk management and financial instruments The Groups treasury policy seeks to ensure that: adequate financial resources are available for the development of the Groups businesses, ensuring also long-term security in support of our products for the benefit of customers.
This includes the provision of funding for capital expenditure, working capital and the bonding requirements of our contract businesses: and financial risk of currency, interest rate and counterparty exposure is minimised as far as possible, as set out in the following sections, and that no speculative transactions are undertaken.
Group Treasury operates as a service centre from locations in the UK, US and Singapore within clearly defined guidelines.
Policy in respect of the major areas of treasury management is set out below: Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to set the proportion of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt taking into account factors such as the interest rate, the business cycle and the Groups level of financial leverage.
The Group uses fixed-rate borrowings, interest rate swaps, forward-rate agreements and currency swaps to manage its interest rate exposure.
As at 31 March 2007, 431 million of borrowings including 96 million of interest rate swaps maturing during 2007 were in fixed-rate form, representing 260% of net debt and 89% of gross debt 2006: 911 million, representing 120% of net debt and 75% of gross debt.
Currency risk Translation exposure In common with other companies operating with many international subsidiaries, a currency risk arises on the translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into sterling.
This risk is not hedged but, as discussed below, future currency cash flows are considered in determining the mix of net debt.
Similarly a currency risk arises on the translation of the balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries into sterling.
The Group targets a level of net debt by currency according to the level of cash generation by currency and with reference to gross debt, pension liabilities and finance costs.
Transaction exposure Currency transaction exposure arises where actual revenue and purchases are made by the Groups businesses in a currency other than their own functional currency.
The incidence of this risk varies across the different businesses of the Group although the majority of revenues and purchases will usually be in the businesses local markets and in their respective functional currencies.
Where this is not the case, the Groups businesses are required to hedge their known exposures.
The Group is also subject to risk in bids where an exchange rate assumed in making such a bid to a customer can lead to a change in margin should a bid be successful and lead to a contract.
The risk is hedged if significant.
The Group predominantly uses forward currency contracts and currency options to manage transaction exposure.
Price risk The Groups exposure to changing market prices on the value of financial instruments has an impact on the carrying value of financial assets that are classified as available-for-sale and on financial assets at fair value through the income statement.
On 31 March 2007, the total carrying value of these financial assets was 7 million 2006: 17 million.
Counterparty risk The Group monitors the counterparties with whom it deposits cash and transacts other financial instruments so as to control exposure to any territory or institution.
Surplus funds are placed for short periods with highly-rated institutions in money market deposits.
Derivatives Derivatives are used to manage the interest rate and currency risks described above and further detail is provided below: i Classification and fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table sets out the classification, carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates translated at year end exchange rates.
Receivables and payables have been included to the extent they are classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32.
Provisions have been included where there is a contractual obligation to settle in cash.
92 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 The fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 March was: Book Fair Book Fair value value value value 2007 2007 2006 2006 m m m m Financial assets Investments accounted for using the equity method 1 1 Available-for-sale investments 11 4 4 Financial assets at fair value through the income statement 66 13 13 Trade and other receivables 519 519 556 556 Cash and cash equivalents 307 307 450 450 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate swaps 11 3 3 Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 11 1 1 Financial liabilities Short-term bank and other loans 10 10 Long-term bank and other loans 472 509 1,189 1,277 Finance leases 1 1 8 8 Provisions 43 43 50 50 Trade and other payables 559 559 586 586 Derivative financial instruments: Foreign exchange swaps and forwards 1 1 2 2 The directors consider that the carrying amount of these financial assets and liabilities approximates to their fair value.
The Group has, in the ordinary course of business, provided indemnities to banks in respect of performance guarantees issued to customers.
The fair value of such indemnities is not material as the likelihood of any liability arising from them is considered remote.
In a very limited number of cases, the Group has guaranteed certain borrowings by third parties.
At 31 March 2007, the maximum credit risk to the Group arising from these guarantees was 4 million 2006: 8 million, being the total amount of such borrowings outstanding at that date.
Financial assets with a carrying value of up to 148 million 2006: 412 million are subject to charges relating to such loans.
ii Interest rate profiles of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profiles of the Groups cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term borrowings are set out in Notes 20 and 21 respectively.
The Groups interest rate swaps are set out below.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Group are non-interest bearing and a statement has been made to that effect in the relevant balance sheet notes.
iii Maturity analysis of interest bearing financial assets and liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups short and long-term borrowings is set out in Note 21 and of the Groups cash and short-term deposits is set out in Note 20. iv Derivative financial instruments A summary of derivative financial instruments is as follows: Fair Fair value value 2007 2006 m m Derivative assets 2 4 Derivative liabilities 1 2 1 2 The Group uses derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, currency transaction exposure and currency translation exposure.

3 million 2006: 1 million was transferred to the income statement during the year to 31 March 2007 in respect of hedged interest cash flows.
Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge transaction exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to hedge currency exposure arising from sales and purchases made by the Groups businesses in currencies other than their own functional currency.
The turnover i. e. notional principal of such derivatives which typically have a term of less than one year, excluding swaps, in the year to 31 March 2007 was 255 million 2006: 133 million and their fair value at 31 March was: Fair Fair value value 2007 2006 m m Derivative assets 1 Derivative liabilities 1 All of these instruments are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.

Foreign exchange swaps and forwards used to hedge translation exposure The Group uses foreign exchange swaps and forwards to match the currency profile of its net debt to that of its net assets, revenue and earnings.
The fair value of such derivatives which typically have a term of less than one year is set out below: Fair Fair value value 2007 2006 m m Derivative assets 1 Derivative liabilities 2 1 The currency assets and liabilities created by such derivatives at 31 March were: Assets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 m m m m m m Sterling 65 65 1 1 Euro 2 2 8 8 United States dollar 51 51 62 62 Australian dollar 7 7 Japanese yen 2 2 11 11 Other 14 14 68 68 67 67 78 79 1 Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are taken directly to the income statement.

Such costs are generally incurred over the product life cycle.
Restructuring provisions cover committed costs, the majority of which are expected to be incurred within one year of the balance sheet date.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount can be determined reliably.
This generally coincides with a commitment to a formal plan or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
Other provisions principally relate to onerous lease rentals in respect of vacant property, other onerous contracts and legal claims.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise largely within the next five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of provisions equates to their fair value.
Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 95 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 25 Pensions and post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution schemes The Group operates many defined contribution schemes.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution schemes represented contributions payable in the year and amounted to 8 million 2006: 9 million.
At 31 March 2007, there were 1 million 2006: 1 million of outstanding contributions included in payables.
ii Defined benefit schemes general The Group operates many funded and unfunded defined benefit pension and post-retirement schemes.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the independent actuary of the relevant scheme.
There are two main funded defined benefit schemes in the UK and US, together with other smaller schemes in the rest of the world.
The principal Group scheme covering the majority of UK employees is the Invensys Pension Scheme.
The Invensys Pension Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
These assets are managed by trustees, who are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
Since 1988 the Trustee Board has been comprised of 11 directors drawn from company and member nominees.
Due in part to the changing membership profile the Trustee Board will in future be made up of nine directors, four will be nominated by the Company and five by the members.
The Company is responsible for appointing the Chairman from the Board.
The last full actuarial valuation of the Scheme for funding purposes was carried out with a valuation date of 30 September 2005 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method for valuing the liabilities.
The assumptions that had the most effect on the results of this valuation for funding purposes are those relating to the discount rate on scheme liabilities and mortality assumptions.
There are numerous schemes operated by overseas subsidiaries.
Of these the largest US scheme is assessed annually by an actuary, and the other overseas defined benefit schemes are normally assessed periodically by independent actuaries in accordance with local practice.
The Group also operates a number of non-pension post-retirement benefit plans, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired former employees of the Groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The last full valuations of all schemes on an IAS 19 basis have been updated to 31 March 2007. iii Defined benefit schemes major assumptions The major assumptions made when valuing the assets and liabilities of funded and unfunded schemes under IAS 19 are as follows: For March 2007 the major financial assumptions are: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.45 4.00 3.91 1.44 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.50 2.41 0.94 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.35 5.95 5.30 5.95 5.36 Inflation rate 3.20 2.50 2.74 2.10 For March 2006 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.63 2.47 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.35 1.91 1.68 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.95 6.05 5.11 6.05 4.76 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.26 2.16 For March 2005 the major financial assumptions were: Funded schemes Unfunded schemes Invensys Invensys Pension Pension US Scheme UK Plan US Other healthcare Other %%%%% Major assumptions Rates of increase in salaries 4.15 4.00 3.10 2.33 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 3.15 1.86 1.46 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.40 5.75 5.11 5.75 4.78 Inflation rate 2.90 2.50 2.01 1.91 The assumptions used for medical trend rates for beneficiaries of the US healthcare scheme were 9.0% per annum, declining to an ultimate rate of 5.0% in 2007 2006: 9.0% declining to 5.0%: 2005: 10.0% declining to 5.0%.
The inflationary pension increases granted in the year were 3.20% 2006: 2.90%: 2005: 2.90%.
96 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 The demographic assumptions which were consistently applied for the main schemes are as follows: Invensys Pension Scheme UK Standard actuarial mortality tables PA92 were adopted using year of birth and medium cohort projections.
Probability of death at each age was multiplied by 126%.
By way of illustration the impact of the application of these mortality tables on the expected longevity of pensioners is shown below: Years Retiring today at age 65: Male 20.2 Female 22.9 Retiring in 20 years at age 65: Male 21.4 Female 24.1 Invensys Pension Plan US The mortality table adopted was the RP 2000 Table for combined employee annuitants, projected to 2007 using projection scale AA.

This is an accrued benefits valuation method that discounts the best estimate of future cash flows and makes allowance for projected earnings.
If the UK scheme were to be wound up, the relevant employers would be responsible, under section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995 to fund the UK scheme up to the levels of the cost of buying out the benefits for all scheme members with an insurer.
This cost would be considerably more than the value placed on the ongoing liabilities for accounting purposes.
The deficit in the UK scheme calculated on a winding up basis was approximately 1.8 billion as at 30 September 2005.
Following the repatriation of the surplus within the Australia Superannuation Fund, 28 million of assets and liabilities now accrue to defined contribution scheme members and have therefore been reclassified.
A summary of the overall net actuarial loss of 56 million and its components is provided within Note iv on page 97.

In respect of the UK scheme, Government and Corporate Bond indices have been used to set the expected rate of return on bonds, and a risk premium has been applied to determine the expected long-term rate of return on equity investments.
Similar processes are applied to other schemes.
The Trustee of the UK scheme adopted a new statement of investment principles which resulted in a change in the investment strategy of the scheme during the year.
Under the new principles, the Trustees will target a long-term rate or return on investments as a whole, at 1% per annum over Government stock of appropriate duration to the schemes liabilities.
This investment strategy would give an overall expected rate of return of 5.50% per annum at the balance sheet date based on market conditions at this date.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRSs and taken directly to equity of 606 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 April 2004.

In addition, the Company will continue to make supplemental contributions to the scheme of 20 million per annum in the year ending 31 March 2008, followed by contributions of 36 million per annum increasing by 1 million per annum thereafter until 31 March 2015.
Where the proceeds from the sale of a business exceed 1 million, at least 8% of the proceeds net of tax and costs will be paid as additional contributions to the UK scheme.
The funding plan is subject to revision after the next triennial valuation which is expected to have a reference date of 31 March 2008.
Under the US plan, the Companys agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation provided for additional contributions of 4% of net proceeds from future disposals.
Benefits to be paid by the UK pension scheme are expected to be as per the graph below: 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2008 2014 2020 2026 2032 2038 2044 2050 Year 26 Trade and other payables 2007 2006 m m Non-current Other payables 16 13 16 13 Current Trade payables 333 295 Accruals and deferred income 157 164 Interest payable 5 22 Other payables 120 119 615 600 Terms and conditions of the above financial liabilities are as follows: Trade payables are non-interest bearing and are on average normally settled on 60-day terms.
Interest payable on the Groups major borrowing facilities is settled quarterly throughout the financial year.
Other payables include sales taxes, social security and payroll taxes, payroll creditors, customer advances not related to construction contracts, payments received from customers in advance of work performed on construction contracts and commissions payable.
The majority of non-current other payables will mature in more than one year but in less than two years: there is a small proportion that will mature in over five years.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of both current and non-current trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

Subsequent to the Rights issue, the Companys ordinary shares have been consolidated on the basis of one new ordinary share of 10p each for every 10 existing ordinary shares of 1p each on 7 August 2006.
On that date, the total number of shares in issue therefore reduced from 7,962,222,990 ordinary shares of 1p each to 796,222,299 ordinary shares of 10p each.
Shares reserved for issue under share options and awards As a consequence of the Rights issue, with effect from 15 June 2006 all options granted under the various share option schemes operated by the Company and awards granted under the Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP have, in accordance with the rules of the respective schemes and as approved by the HM Revenue and Customs where appropriate, been adjusted as follows: a the number of shares in respect of which options have been granted have been adjusted by the application of a multiplication factor of 1.07058 and the exercise price has been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 0.93406: and b the number of shares in each LTIP award has been adjusted by a multiplication factor of 1.07058.
Subsequently, as a consequence of the Share consolidation, with effect from 7 August 2006, the number of shares comprised in each option and award were divided by 10 and the exercise option prices were multiplied by 10.
All figures presented in the section below for the number of share options and awards, and the amounts for exercise prices and average prices have been restated to take into account the effects of the Rights issue and Share consolidation as noted above.
During the year the Company issued 16,414 ordinary shares of 10p each pursuant to the exercise of options under the Invensys Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
The awards are subject to a three year performance period from the date of grant after which 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirement will be released at that time with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Outstanding awards under the LTIP at 31 March 2007, which, subject to satisfaction of the performance requirement and any appropriate holding period, will be released at various dates between 2008 and 2011, were 19,644,641 2006: 21,596,351.

Capital redemption reserve This reserve arose when the Company repurchased its own shares for cancellation as part of a return of capital programme and is nondistributable.
Subsequently, in the year ended 31 March 2005, 3,499,780,822 deferred shares of 24p each were cancelled, in accordance with their terms of issue.
This cancellation resulted in a transfer of 840 million from share capital to the capital redemption reserve.
Capital reserve Previously the Group merger reserve, this reserve was created on the merger of BTR plc and Siebe plc in February 1999 and is non-distributable.
Cash flow hedge reserve This reserve records, for each hedged item in an effective cash flow hedge, the cumulative change in fair value of the expected future cash flow on the hedged item from the inception of the hedge relationship.

The Company operates various share schemes under which options and awards have been granted and are outstanding as detailed below: Plans for senior employees Executive share options Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Share Option Scheme Grant details An executive share option scheme under which options have been granted to directors and senior executives at no cost.
Options are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the grant date at a price equal to the average middle market quoted price of the Companys shares over the five dealing days which precede the date of grant.
Options are satisfied by the issue of new shares or in the case of awards granted as share appreciation rights, in cash.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: a for grants made prior to 25 July 2001, earnings per share EPS performance of RPI 12% over a three year period to be applied each year until the earlier of when the condition is met or the measurement period the last financial year of which is the year preceding that in which the option will lapse: b for grants made between 25 July 2001 and 16 June 2002 EPS of RPI 12% in the three years after grant or EPS of RPI 16% in the four years after grant or EPS of RPI 20% in the five years after grant, failing which the option will lapse: and c for grants made on 17 June 2002 and after, total shareholder return TSR performance against a peer group of the FTSE100 over a performance period of three, four or five years commencing on the date of grant.
40% will be exercisable if the median position is achieved, rising to 100% if upper quartile position is achieved.
Between these two points the option will vest on a straight-line basis.
If the performance condition is not met in full at the first measurement then it will be retested against the fixed base in years four and five.
If the median position is not achieved by the end of the fifth year the option will lapse.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the option will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although options may be exercisable for a certain period of time in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
Scheme use The Company does not propose to operate the Scheme, except in the case of recruitment situations, where it may be considered appropriate.
Hence no options were granted during the years ended 31 March 2007 or 31 March 2006.

106 Invensys plc Annual report accounts 2007 Long-term incentives Invensys 1998 Senior Executive Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Grant details A long-term incentive plan under which awards are granted to directors and senior executives at no or nominal cost.
Depending on the country in which the participant is resident the award would be delivered using one of the following mechanisms: a a nominal price option award which is a right to acquire shares for a nominal payment unless the Company determines otherwise : b a conditional share award: or c a cash award granted in respect of a notional number of shares.
Awards are normally subject to a three year performance period, commencing on the date of award, followed by a retention period.
For awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 the retention period was two years: for awards made on or after 22 July 2005, 50% of any shares vesting on satisfaction of the performance requirements will be released at the end of the performance period with the other 50% being deferred for one year.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: TSR test TSR ranked against a peer group, selected at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee with no retesting opportunities.
TSR must rank at the median position when the peer group is ranked in descending order of TSR in order for 25% of the shares subject to the award to be available subject to the retention period, rising to 100% of the shares if the upper decile position is achieved.
Between these positions, the number of shares will be calculated on a straight-line basis.
If at least the median position is not achieved the whole award will lapse.
The peer groups selected for the relevant awards are as follows: awards granted prior to 22 July 2005: the companies that comprised the FTSE Mid 250 Index on the date of grant: and awards granted on or after 22 July 2005: ABB, Eaton, Emerson, GE, Honeywell, Johnson Controls, Rockwell, Schlumberger, Schneider, Siemens, Smiths Group and Yokogawa.
Overall performance test The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied that: a for awards granted prior to 22 July 2005 there has been a sustained delivery over the performance period, regarding the trading performance of continuing operations, disposal proceeds and reduction in Group indebtedness: b for awards granted on or after 22 July 2005 that two underpins have been met: 1 achievement of stretching internal free cash flow targets: and 2 efficient management of legacy liability items: and c for awards granted on or after 1 June 2006 that two underpin tests have been met: 1 relating to the successful completion of the 2006 Refinancing and in addition that there has been a sustained improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company: and 2 efficient management of legacy liability items.
Service requirements: the general rule is that the award will lapse if the participant leaves employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee after the completion of the first two years of the performance period.
Scheme use Given that no further awards can be granted under the LTIP after July 2008 it has been decided that a new share-based long-term incentive plan, to be known as the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan 2007 LTIP should be established.
Implementation of the LTIP is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Grants made during the years ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 are detailed below: LTIP awards LTIP awards granted in the granted in the year ended year ended 31 March 2007 31 March 2006 Total number of awards granted 6,202,739 16,490,152 Weighted average fair value 101.14p 52.21p Exercise price n a n a Expected volatility n a n a Weighted average expected award life 3.5 years 3.5 years Expected dividend yield 0.00% 0.00% Risk free interest rate n a n a Details of relevant LTIP awards outstanding during the year are as follows: Number Number of awards of awards 2007 2006 Outstanding at the beginning of the year 23,220,809 8,057,352 Granted during the year 6,202,739 16,490,152 Forfeited during the year 4,044,343 854,580 Vested during the year Lapsed during the year 3,794,913 472,115 Outstanding at the end of the year 21,584,292 23,220,809 The LTIP awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 2.3 years 2006: 3.0 years.

The TBOP operates in addition to the existing Executive Bonus Plan EBP.
Any bonuses earned under the TBOP the Overlay Bonus are payable in shares with 50% of the shares awarded being released following the first anniversary of those shares being awarded and the other 50% being released following the second anniversary.

Scheme use The first grant under the TBOP was made on 1 June 2006.
It was originally anticipated that the TBOP would be operated up to and including the financial year 2007 08.
However, as a result of the changes being made to the annual incentive arrangements for 2007 08 onwards as detailed in the Remuneration report, the TBOP will cease to be operated one year early.
It is anticipated that the awards for the financial year 2006 07 will be granted in June 2007.

It is based on a savings plan and is offered to eligible full and part-time employees.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: there are no performance conditions, other than that a participant is required to complete the savings contract in order to exercise their options.
Scheme use The use of the Scheme and potential future launches are reviewed on a regular basis.

Measurement of fair value The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to calculate the fair value of options granted during the year.
An adjusted market value method of valuation, based on market value at grant date, adjusted for expected forfeitures and market-based performance conditions has been used to calculate the fair value of all other awards i. e. LTIP and RSP awards.
Expected volatility was based on both historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous ten years and on the implied volatility of traded options of the Groups shares.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
