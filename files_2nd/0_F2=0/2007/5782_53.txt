Share-based payments Equity settled share option plans Included within wages and salaries in note 6 is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 909,889 2006: 615,014 all of which relate to equity settled share-based payments.
Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the remuneration report.
As described in note 27, the Group issued ordinary share capital by way of a rights issue at a discount to the market.
Consequently a bonus element was applied to the number of share options outstanding as at the date of the rights issue and the exercise price of those options were reduced so that the fair value of the grant to the option holder was not affected.
Below is a summary of the schemes in place during the year: a Executive share option scheme The Group operates an executive share option scheme under which awards of share options are made to selected individuals directors and senior managers based on the achievement of an EPS growth target established at the date of grant.
The EPS growth is calculated for a continuous three year period during the normal exercise period.
When the EPS growth is met the options vest and can be exercised within ten years of the grant date.
b Performance share plan Under the 2003 and 2004 awards, selected individuals directors and senior managers receive an award of shares based on the growth in the Total Shareholder Return TSR for the Group over a three year performance period when compared to growth in TSR of FTSE mid 250 companies, provided that the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the underlying financial performance of the Group has improved on a sustainable basis over the period.
To the extent that any options vest, they will ordinarily remain exercisable up to three years and three months from the date of grant and are settled in equity once exercised.
Under the 2005 and 2006 awards, which were restricted to executive directors, an award may be made, provided a non-market-based performance condition of specified EPS growth is achieved over a three year performance period.
c Sharesave scheme Under the schemes, which are open to all employees of eligible Group companies, employees are granted share options at a discount to the open market value at the date of grant.
The employees enter into a savings plan for a three year period after which they have a choice of exercising their option or withdrawing saved funds.
No conditions other than continued employment are attached to the grant.
