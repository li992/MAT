9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and treasury stock which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company had two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares during the year: those being share options granted to employees and directors where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and the awards made under the Companys Restricted Stock Unit RSU, Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP schemes.
For 2007 and 2006 no shares that were allocated for awards under the LTIP were included in the diluted EPS calculation as the performance criteria could not be measured until the conclusion of the performance period.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are shown on the face of the income statement.
