FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 81 9 Pension liability 2007 2006 $ million $ million UK funded pension scheme 2.6 3.4 UK unfunded pension scheme 1.1 1.0 Total liability in balance sheet 3.7 4.4 The company operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution basis, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 Employee Benefits valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2005 using the Attained Age Method and a market-related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 6.5 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.8 per cent pa and pensions increases: 2.8 per cent pa.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 9.9 million and, on the specific method and assumptions adopted, the assets covered 93 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
During 2007, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 19 per cent of pensionable salaries together with 336,000 paid in monthly instalments.
Aside from any further lump sum contribution, the employer expects to contribute 427,000 to the Scheme in 2008.
The following figures have been prepared in compliance with FRS 17 Employee Benefits incorporating the amendment announced in December 2006 by an independent actuary on the basis of membership data current as at 31 December 2007 but taking account of pension increases effected on 1 January 2008.
