qxp 18 3 08 18:35 Page 81 The Directors believe that their estimates, which are based upon the current state of the UK property market, are appropriate.
However, it is possible that it may take longer to dispose of leases than they anticipate.
As a result the provisions may be understated, but in the opinion of the Directors this is unlikely to be material.
Insurance provisions The Group has been substantially self-insured since 2001.
The nature of insurance claims is that they frequently take many years to fully crystalise, therefore the Directors have to estimate the value of provisions to hold in the balance sheet in respect of historic claims.
Under the guidance of the Groups insurance advisors, the value of incurred claims is estimated using the Generalised Cape Cod Method.
The provision is determined by deducting the value of claims settled to date from the estimated level of claims incurred.
Whilst the Generalised Cape Cod Method is an insurance industry standard methodology, it relies on historic trends to determine the level of expected claims.
To the extent that the estimates are inaccurate the Group may be underprovided, but in the opinion of the Directors any under-provision is unlikely to be material.

The sale proceeds net of costs were 31.5m and the carrying value of the properties was 15.2m.
