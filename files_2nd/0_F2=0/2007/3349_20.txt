Notes to the consolidated financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Charter plc have been prepared on the basis of accounting policies set out below in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as endorsed by the European Union and implemented in the UK as well as those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Use of adjusted measures To help provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance adjusted earnings per share excludes: amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles and goodwill: items which are both material and non-recurring exceptional items : and foreign currency exchange differences on the retranslation of intercompany loans, which are determined by reference to movements in exchange rates.
These amounts are likely to be volatile and are unrelated to underlying performance.
The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented, unless otherwise stated, in respect of the Company, its subsidiaries and associated undertakings.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates, judgements and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements.
On an ongoing basis, estimates are evaluated using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods that are considered reasonable in the particular circumstances to ensure compliance with IFRS.
Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.
Should circumstances change, such that different assumptions, estimates and judgements are considered to be more appropriate, this may give rise to material adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year particularly in respect of the key estimates, judgements and assumptions outlined below.
Construction contracts Revenue and profit on construction contracts are usually recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract calculated by reference to estimates of contract revenue and expected costs including provisions for warranty and product liability.
At 31 December 2007, amounts receivable payable under construction contracts were 55.7 million 2006: 38.4 million and 82.2 million 2006: 53.6 million respectively.
Contract retentions held by customers at 31 December 2007, in respect of construction contracts amounted to 29.3 million 2006: 22.1 million.
Warranty and product liability provisions at 31 December 2007, of 21.3 million 2006: 14.6 million mainly relate to construction contracts.
Employee benefits Provisions for defined benefit post employment obligations are calculated by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions and estimates used are based on independent actuarial advice and include the discount rate and estimates of life expectancy.
At 31 December 2007, the net retirement benefit obligation was 76.6 million 2006: 108.8 million.
Goodwill impairment testing Capitalised goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
Should the carrying value of the goodwill exceed its recoverable amount an impairment loss is recognised.
The recoverable amounts are calculated based on the estimated value in use of cash-generating units.
These calculations require estimates of cash flows and discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, adjusted for specific risks associated with particular cash-generating units.
At 31 December 2007, the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill was 60.1 million 2006: 39.3 million.
Provisions Provision is made for liabilities that are uncertain in timing or amount of settlement.
These include provisions for legal and environmental claims.
Calculations of these provisions are based on cash flows relating to these costs estimated by management supported by the use of external consultants, discounted at an appropriate rate where the impact of discounting is material.
At 31 December 2007, these provisions amounted to 29.7 million 2006: 29.7 million.
Tax estimates The Groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in effect.
The determination of appropriate provisions for current and deferred income taxation requires the Group to take into account anticipated decisions of tax authorities and estimate the Groups ability to utilise tax benefits through future earnings and tax planning.
These estimates and assumptions may differ from future events.
At 31 December 2007, income tax liabilities provided were 27.3 million 2006: 22.0 million and net deferred income tax assets recognised amounted to 12.7 million 2006: 10.0 million.
Changes to accounting policies Employee benefits recognition of actuarial gains and losses and classification of income statement charge All actuarial gains and losses are now recognised immediately directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Previously actuarial gains and losses below a certain threshold were not recognised and those above this threshold were recognised in the income statement prospectively over the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in the plan.
A statement of recognised income and expense is now presented as a primary statement instead of a statement of changes in equity.
The classification of the income statement charge has been changed such that the expected return on schemes assets and interest on schemes liabilities are now included within the net financing credit.
Previously these items were included in arriving at operating profit.
These changes have been implemented with effect from 1 January 2007 and the 2006 comparatives have been restated to reflect these changes.
The Directors consider these changes align the Group more closely with general UK accounting practice under IFRS.
58 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Changes to accounting policies continued Employee benefits recognition of actuarial gains and losses and classification of income statement charge continued Details of the restatement are set out in the following table: 2006 As As Amount of reported restated restatement m m m Operating profit 143.2 144.6 1.4 Net financing charge 4.4 4.4 Profit for the year 127.7 129.1 1.4 Retirement benefit assets 6.4 21.7 15.3 Retirement benefit obligations 115.0 130.5 15.5 Deferred income tax assets 34.0 34.6 0.6 Deferred income tax liabilities 19.6 24.6 5.0 Exchange translation losses taken to group equity 13.2 12.0 1.2 Actuarial gains on retirement benefit obligations 23.2 23.2 Tax on actuarial gains on retirement benefit obligations 2.4 2.4 Opening equity shareholders funds 135.1 107.1 28.0 Closing equity shareholders funds 250.7 246.1 4.6 pence pence pence Earnings per share basic 73.5 74.4 0.9 Earnings per share adjusted 67.2 68.1 0.9 Diluted earnings per share basic 73.0 73.9 0.9 Diluted earnings per share adjusted 66.8 67.6 0.8 Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Groups financial statements The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, but they are not relevant or have an insignificant impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRS 4, Insurance contracts: IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of embedded derivatives: and IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them: IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing costs effective from 1 January 2009.
The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
The Group will apply IAS 23 Amendment from 1 January 2009 but it is currently not expected to have a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 8, Operating segments effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The Group will apply IFRS 8 from 1 January 2009.
The expected impact is being assessed, but it appears likely that the number of reportable segments, as well as the manner in which the segments are reported, will change in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction effective from 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Charter plc Annual Report 2007 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Groups operations The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations: IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements effective from 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 12 applies to contractual arrangements whereby a private sector operator participates in the development, financing, operation and maintenance of infrastructure for public sector services.
IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Groups operations because none of the Groups companies provide for public sector services.
IFRIC 13, Customer loyalty programmes effective from 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 13 clarifies that where goods or services are sold together with a customer loyalty incentive for example, loyalty points or free products, the arrangement is a multiple-element arrangement and the consideration receivable from the customer is allocated between the components of the arrangement in using fair values.
IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Groups operations because none of the Groups companies operate any loyalty programmes.
ii Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity.
A shareholding of more than one-half of the voting rights will normally be the basis of such control.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus the costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired, including all separately identifiable intangible assets, is goodwill which has been recorded as an intangible asset since 1 January 1998 see viii a Goodwill below.
Where additional shareholdings in associate entities are acquired any fair value adjustments related to the shareholdings prior to the increase in shareholding are taken directly to equity.
Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, normally on the basis of a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses, net of interest and tax, is recognised in the income statement and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Accounting policies of associates have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intercompany balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intercompany transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
The Group has taken advantage of the business combinations exemption in IFRS 1 and has not restated business combinations that took place before 1 January 2004. iii Segmental reporting The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products that are subject to risks and returns that are different from other business segments.
Segmental assets comprise total assets excluding income tax assets.
Segmental liabilities comprise total liabilities excluding income tax liabilities and borrowings other than bank overdrafts.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Revenue by geographic segment is allocated based on the country in which the customer is located.
Assets and capital expenditure by geographic segment are allocated based on where the assets are located.
iv Foreign currencies Items included in the financial statements for each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency and presentation currency of Charter plc.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency of Group entities using the exchange rate at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement except where deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges.
The results and net assets of all Group companies that have non-sterling functional currency are included in the consolidated financial statements as follows: a Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date: b Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant period: and c All resulting exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to shareholders equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences arising since 1 January 2004 are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
v Financial assets The classification of financial assets depends on the purpose for which the assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition and re-evaluates their designation at each reporting date.
Assets are classified as: loans and receivables: held to maturity investments: available-for-sale financial assets: or financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement.
Available-for-sale financial assets include non-derivatives not classified in any of the other categories.
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification.
On initial recognition loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets where changes in fair value are charged or credited to the income statement are subsequently measured at fair value.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available-for-sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available-for-sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are included in the income statement.
60 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 1 Accounting policies continued v Financial assets continued Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial assets classified as loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
They are classified as current if they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date.
vi Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency swaps, that are used as hedges in the financing and financial risk management of the Group are categorised as hedges.
Derivative financial instruments categorised as hedges are initially measured at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured at their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement together with any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
For cash flow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity, with any ineffective portion recognised in the income statement.
When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in shareholders equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in shareholders equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.
For net investment hedges gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the income statement.
vii Property, plant and equipment The Groups policy is to carry property, plant and equipment at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except that certain properties were revalued on transition to IFRS at 1 January 2004.
These revaluations are treated as deemed cost as at 1 January 2004 as allowed by IFRS 1.
In accordance with the benchmark treatment under IFRS, borrowing costs associated with expenditure on property, plant and equipment are not capitalised.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognised.
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation on other assets is calculated using the straight line method spreading the difference between cost and residual value over the estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 30-50 years Plant, machinery and equipment 8-14 years Vehicles 5 years IT equipment 3-5 years The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
A review of useful lives of plant, machinery and equipment was performed during 2006.
This resulted in a reduction of the depreciation charge of 1.6 million for 2006, which is expected to recur over the remaining life of the plant, machinery and equipment.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount see ix Impairment of assets below.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised in the income statement.
viii Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary or associate acquired.
Goodwill, represented by the carrying value at 1 January 2004 under the Groups previous accounting policy together with additional amounts arising since that date is no longer amortised and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is included in intangible assets in relation to subsidiaries and in investments in associates in relation to associates.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the classification and accounting treatment of business combinations has not been restated on transition to IFRS, as permitted by IFRS 1.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising in the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised as an intangible asset in relation to subsidiaries and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, a period not exceeding twenty years or included as part of the carrying value of associates.
Goodwill acquired in business combinations and carried in the balance sheet is allocated to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
b Research and development Research expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible assets, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life of the asset created, usually between three and ten years.
c Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the licence, usually between three and five years.
Internal expenditure associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred, except such costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group that are likely to generate benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, in which case such costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software product, usually less than three years.
Charter plc Annual Report 2007 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued viii Intangible assets continued d Intangibles arising on acquisitions In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on acquisitions the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives, usually between three and ten years.
ix Impairment of assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
x Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined using the first-in first-out FIFO basis or the average cost basis.
Cost includes expenditure which is incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less all disposal costs to be incurred.
xi Assets held for sale Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable within one year from the date of classification.
Assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell and cease to be depreciated from the date of classification.
xii Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Trade receivables are discounted when the time value of money is considered material.
Amounts due after more than twelve months from the balance sheet date are classified in the balance sheet as non-current.
xiii Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
xiv Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
xv Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Where borrowings are used to hedge the Groups interest in the net assets of foreign operations, the portion of the gain or loss on the borrowings that are determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in shareholders equity.
Gains and losses accumulated in shareholders equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
xvi Taxation Taxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred income taxation.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity including actuarial gains and losses on retirement benefit obligations see xvii Employee benefits below and share-based payments see xviii Share-based payments below, in which case it is recognised in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income taxation liabilities are provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated balance sheet.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income taxation is not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the resulting temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future or where the remittance would not give rise to incremental tax liabilities or is otherwise not taxable.
xvii Employee benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar post retirement benefits principally healthcare under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
In respect of defined benefit pension plans, where the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement is defined by the plan, the liability recorded in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined obligation at that date less the fair value of the plan assets, together with an adjustment for any unrecognised past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in full in the period in which they occur directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Taxation attributable to actuarial gains and losses is taken to equity.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period, in which case the past service costs are spread over that period.
62 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 1 Accounting policies continued xvii Employee benefits continued For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to operating profit in the income statement comprises the current service cost, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
Interest on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is included within the financing credit in the income statement.
For defined contribution plans, where the Group pays a fixed contribution into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions irrespective of whether or not the fund has sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to service in the current and prior periods, the contributions are recognised as an expense when they are due.
For other defined benefit post employment obligations, principally post employment medical arrangements in the US, a similar accounting methodology to that for defined benefit pension plans is used.
Where the actuarial valuation of a scheme demonstrates that the scheme is in surplus, the recognised asset is limited to the extent that the Group can benefit in future, for example, by refunds or a reduction in contributions.
Movements in the amount of any irrecoverable surplus are recognised directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xviii Share-based payments The Group operates both equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the participation in the plan is recognised as an expense in the income statement.
In the case of equity-settled plans the fair value of the employee service is based on the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
This expense is spread over the vesting period of the instrument.
The corresponding entry is credited to equity.
Taxation attributable to the excess of the fair value over the charge to the income statement is taken to equity.
The liability for social security costs arising in relation to the awards is re-measured at each reporting date based on the share price as at the reporting date and the elapsed portion of the relevant vesting periods to the extent it is considered probable that a liability will arise.
Cash-settled plans are measured on a similar basis except that the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date, with changes recognised in the income statement.
For cash-settled plans the corresponding entry is included as a liability.
xix Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
xx Provisions for other liabilities Provisions for disposal and restructuring costs, warranty and product liability, and legal and environmental liability are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If all these conditions are not met then no provision is recognised.
Incurred but not reported IBNR amounts are included in provisions.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
If the effect of discounting is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected value of future cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
xxi Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services and the value of work executed during the year in respect of construction contracts.
Revenue, which is recorded net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts, and after eliminating intragroup sales, is recognised as follows: a Sales of goods and services The majority of the Groups revenues relate to the sale of goods and services which are recognised when a group entity has fulfilled its contractual obligations to a customer and has obtained the right to receive consideration.
In respect of the sale of goods this is usually on despatch but is dependent upon the contractual terms that have been agreed with a customer.
b Construction contracts Revenue is recognised by a group entity in accordance with the stage of completion of its contractual obligations to the customer.
The stage of completion is usually based on the proportion of costs incurred compared to the total expected costs to complete the contract, where this also represents a right to receive consideration, and provided the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period in which the loss first becomes foreseeable.
Contract losses are determined to be the amount by which estimated direct and indirect costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract.
xxii Leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included in property, plant and equipment and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as an obligation under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest repayment elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element charged to income so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
xxiii Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounts in the period when paid or, if earlier, in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Charter plc Annual Report 2007 63 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Segment analysis Primary reporting format business segments The Group is organised into two principal businesses: ESAB welding, cutting and automation and Howden air and gas handling.
For the purposes of IAS 14 Segment reporting, ESAB is split into two segments: i welding: and ii cutting and automation.

The Group also provides post employment medical benefits in the United States.
Change in accounting policy for recognition of actuarial gains and losses and classification of income statement charge As explained in note 1 all actuarial gains and losses are now recognised immediately directly in equity, in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The valuation of United Kingdom and overseas defined benefit pension schemes and the liability for United States post employment medical benefits are assessed by professionally qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were as follows: 2007 2006 UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% Discount rate 5.80 6.00 5.10 5.50 Inflation rate 3.40 2.60 3.10 2.50 Expected return on plan assets equities 8.00 9.00 7.90 8.90 bonds 4.80 5.60 4.70 5.50 property 7.50 7.40 other 5.75 6.10 5.25 5.40 total 6.30 7.25 6.40 7.20 Future salary increases 4.40 4.00 3.50 3.70 Future pension increases 3.45 2.25 3.20 2.10 Medical costs inflation ultimate rate 5.00 5.00 The mortality assumptions for the UK schemes are based on either the PA92 or PA00 standard mortality tables after retirement with allowance for future mortality improvements and scheme specific factors.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 26 years 2006: 25 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 29 years 2006: 28 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 25 years 2006: 24 years if they are male and for a further 28 years 2006: 27 years if they are female.
The overseas schemes are principally in the United States.
The mortality assumptions for the United States schemes have been derived from the RP-2000 table with allowance for further mortality improvements.
Based on the rates used, a member currently aged 45 who retires at age 60 will live on average for a further 24 years 2006: 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 26 years 2006: 24 years after retirement if they are female.
A retired member currently aged 60 is assumed to live on average for a further 23 years 2006: 22 years if they are male and for a further 25 years 2006: 24 years if they are female.
Mortality assumptions for schemes in Sweden and Germany have been derived from the FFFS 2007 tables and the Heubeck 2005 G tables respectively.
The expected return on plan assets is a blended average of projected long-term results for the various asset classes.
Equity returns are developed based on the selection of the equity risk premium above the risk-free rate which is measured in accordance with the yield on government bonds.
Bond returns are selected by reference to the yields on government and corporate debt as appropriate to the schemes holdings of these instruments.
Other class asset returns are determined by reference to current experience.
The estimated impact on the liability for defined benefit pensions and post employment medical benefits as at 31 December 2007 resulting from changes to key assumptions is set out below: Estimated increase in liability m Discount rate 0.25 per cent decrease 21 Mortality one year increase in life expectancy after retirement 18 78 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 20 Retirement benefit obligations continued Post employment medical benefits A 1 per cent increase in the inflation assumption on medical costs would increase the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million and the liability by 1.6 million.
A 1 per cent decrease in the inflation assumption on medical costs would reduce the total service cost and interest cost by 0.1 million and the liability by 1.5 million.

Charter plc Annual Report 2007 81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Financial instruments and risk management i Risk management a Treasury management Charters central treasury department is responsible for ensuring there are appropriate funding arrangements to meet the ongoing requirements of the Group and for managing effectively liquid funds held in the Group.
In addition, it is responsible for managing the interest rate risks and balance sheet foreign currency translation risks of the Group within guidelines agreed by the Board.
Foreign currency transaction risks are generally managed directly by operating subsidiaries in accordance with guidelines and controls defined in Group policy.
Regular cash flow forecasts are prepared and reviewed by management.
b Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations mainly from its own cash resources.
It is the Groups objective to minimise the cost of borrowings and maximise the value from cash resources, whilst retaining the flexibility of funding opportunities.
If considered appropriate, the Group would use interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
c Currency risk The Group has significant investments in overseas operations and recurring exposures to exchange rate fluctuations in respect of foreign currency transactions.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can affect the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
In certain circumstances, currency borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives may be used to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
Forward foreign exchange contracts may be used to hedge cash flows resulting from foreign currency transactions.
The Group seeks to comply with the requirements of hedge accounting where considered appropriate.
d Credit risk The credit status of dealing counterparties and institutions where cash is held is kept under review with credit limits being set and monitored regularly.
e Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain committed facilities to ensure that there are sufficient funds for current operations and their future growth.
During the year the Group increased its principal committed facility to 75 million.
f Capital management The Group aims to manage its capital structure in order to safeguard the going concern of the Group and to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group may maintain or adjust its capital structure by adjusting the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, returning capital to shareholders, issuing new shares or selling assets.
Capital is regarded as consisting of total equity, net cash and retirement benefit obligations.

At 31 December 2007, 3 2006: 5 participants held options over a total of 228,506 2006: 242,146 ordinary shares of the Company.
During 2007, options over 10,287 ordinary shares were exercised and options over 3,353 shares lapsed.
These options were granted under various employee share option schemes and are exercisable during various periods up to 29 March 2011 at prices ranging from 139.9 pence to 218.0 pence.
Included in the above, under the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan approved by shareholders in 1997, are deferred rights to acquire shares.
This plan has not operated since 2001.
At 31 December 2007, 1 participant held rights over 13,004 shares.
These rights expire on 30 March 2008.
As none of the performance targets associated with any of the awards has been met, the awards would only be of value in the event of a change of control of the Company.
The exercise price of these awards would be funded by a cash bonus payable at the date of exercise and therefore the effective cost to the allottee would be nil.

These lawsuits have alleged that the Charter defendants were liable for the acts of Cape PLC, a former partly owned subsidiary of Charter.
Between 1985 and 1987, the issue was tried in several matters, each of which was resolved in Charters favour either at trial or on appeal.
In subsequent years, Charter and its subsidiaries have continued to be named in asbestosrelated lawsuits.
Charter has contested these actions and, in most cases, has obtained dismissals.
Charter has settled some of the cases brought in Mississippi.
Currently, the only pending cases against Charter are in Mississippi, which cases are dormant and are not actively being pursued by plaintiffs.
The Directors have received legal advice that Charter and its wholly owned subsidiaries should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions brought against them, but that uncertainty must exist as to the eventual outcome of the trial of any particular action.
It is not practicable to estimate in any particular case the amount of damages, which might ensue if liability were imposed on Charter or any of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The defence costs and other expenses charged against Charters operating profits in 2007 were negligible.
The litigation is reviewed each year and, based on that review and legal advice, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any such liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
In these circumstances, the Directors have concluded that it is not appropriate to make provision for any liability in respect of such actions.
ii Air and gas handling Howden Buffalo Inc. an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related actions in the United States.
On the advice of counsel, Howden Buffalo is vigorously defending all the cases that have been filed against it.
Over the past few years, Howden Buffalo has sought and received dismissals in 10,024 cases and has, on the advice of counsel, settled 313 cases.
These cases were all settled for nuisance value amounts, much less than the cost of defending the cases at trial.
Howden Buffalo has received legal advice indicating that it should be able to continue to defend successfully the actions that are brought.
At this time, it is not practical to estimate the amount of any potential damages or to provide details of the current stage of proceedings in particular cases, as the majority of cases do not specify the amount of damages sought and the cases are at varying stages in the litigation process.
However, legal fees associated with the defence of these claims and the cost of the settlements have been covered by applicable insurance.
The Directors believe, based on legal advice, that the majority of asbestos-related lawsuits against Howden Buffalo, including those resulting from the historical operations of a predecessor of Howden Buffalo known as Buffalo Forge Company, will continue to be covered, in substantial part, by applicable insurance.
The situation is reviewed regularly and based on the most recent review and legal advice obtained by Howden Buffalo, the Directors believe that the aggregate of any potential liability is unlikely to have a material effect on Charters financial position.
86 Charter plc Annual Report 2007 27 Contingent liabilities continued iii Welding The ESAB Group Inc. EGI, an indirect subsidiary of Charter, has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits in state and federal courts in the United States alleging personal injuries from exposure to manganese in the fumes of welding consumables.
Other current and former manufacturers of welding consumables have also been named as defendants as well as various other defendants such as distributors, trade associations and others.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts.
A multi-district litigation proceeding has been established to consolidate and co-ordinate pre-trial proceedings in the federal court cases.
Last year, the federal court denied a motion to certify a class action of welders who were seeking medical monitoring relief on behalf of all welders in eight states who were exposed to welding fumes.
Subsequently, the named plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss their individual claims.
In addition, EGI and four other welding companies were defendants in a federal court trial involving a single claimant.
The jury returned a verdict of US$20.5 million against the five defendants, including EGI, which, if upheld on appeal, would be shared among the defendants.
Since the year end, EGI and two other welding companies were defendants in a further federal court trial involving a single claimant.
The jury returned a verdict of US$0.72 million by way of compensatory damages after a 40 per cent reduction to take account of the contributory negligence of the plaintiff which, if upheld on appeal, would be shared among the defendants.
In addition the jury awarded punitive damages of US$1.7 million of which EGIs share is US$0.75 million.
Post-trial motions seeking to overturn these verdicts have been or will be filed, and it is anticipated that in each case an appeal will be filed if the post-trial motions are denied.
With the exception of the punitive damage award, if upheld on appeal, these verdicts would be covered in substantial part by insurance.
EGI was also a defendant in a number of state court trials.
However, all of those cases were either dismissed or postponed.
There are 10 manganese trials scheduled for the balance of 2008, although it is not anticipated that they will all involve EGI or that they will proceed to trial as scheduled.
Additional trials could also be scheduled.
Whilst litigation is notoriously uncertain and the risk of an adverse jury verdict in any trial exists, having considered the advice of EGIs counsel in the United States, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims, most of which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
EGI, in conjunction with other current and former US manufacturers of welding consumables, is defending these claims vigorously.
The defence costs, net of insurance recoveries, are estimated to be of the order of US$20 million, which is reflected in EGIs balance sheet at 31 December 2007.
In view of the foregoing and, in particular, the legal advice received in the United States, the Directors do not consider that such claims will have a material adverse effect on Charters financial position.
EGI has also been named as a defendant in a small number of lawsuits in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania in which claimants allege asbestosinduced personal injuries.
The claimants seek compensatory and, in some cases, punitive damages for unspecified amounts from EGI, other welding consumable manufacturers and other defendants who manufactured a variety of asbestos products.
Several cases are listed for trial this year: however, EGI has been dismissed prior to trial in the previous cases in which it was named as a defendant.
Upon the advice of counsel, the Directors believe that EGI has meritorious defences to these claims and EGI intends vigorously to defend these lawsuits, which should be covered in whole or in part by insurance.
In addition, the majority of defence costs are being borne by EGIs insurers.
iv Other In addition there are contingent liabilities entered into in the normal course of business from which no liability is expected to arise.
