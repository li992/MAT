48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 63 Notes to the Accounts | 63 Accounting Policies 1 General information Wellstream Holdings PLC the Company is a Company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 and is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The Group comprises Wellstream Holdings PLC and its subsidiaries.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and within the directors report.
The Company listed on the London Stock Exchange on 1 May 2007 and there is now a wider spread of investors, and stakeholders generally.
Consequently, the directors have reconsidered the wording of the Groups accounting policies in order to provide the most relevant and tailored information to stakeholders.
It should be noted that the Groups accounting policies are consistent with the prior year, with the exception of the adoption of new and revised standards.
2 Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital see note 22.
Four Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives: and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
In addition, the Group has elected to adopt the following in advance of the effective date:  IFRS 8 Operating Segments effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009  IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and treasury share transactions effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
In contrast, the predecessor Standard IAS 14 Segment Reporting required the Group to identify two sets of segments business and geographical, using a risks and rewards approach, with the Groups system of internal financial reporting to key management personnel serving only as the starting point for the identification of such segments.
As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8 Operating Segments, the identification of the Groups reportable segments note 5 has changed.
IFRIC 11 IFRS2: Group and treasury share transactions provides guidance on applying IFRS 2 to Group share based payment transactions where the parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of its subsidiary.
The guidance requires the subsidiary to measure the services received using the requirements for equity-settled transactions in IFRS 2, and to recognise a corresponding increase in equity as a contribution from the parent.
As this is the first period in which share based payment transactions have occurred, this has not required a change in accounting policy.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following standards and interpretations, were in issue but not yet effective:  IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008  IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008  IFRS 2 Share Based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations effective 1 January 2009  IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised January 2008: effective 1 July 2009  IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements amended January 2008: effective 1 July 2009  IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes effective 1 July 2008  IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 64 64 | Notes to the Accounts continued The directors anticipate that, with the exception of IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs, the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
IAS 23 Revised Borrowing Costs requires that all eligible borrowing costs incurred in respect of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
It is currently Group policy to expense all such borrowing costs as incurred and therefore the adoption of IAS 23 Revised may require a change in accounting policy.
However, this change in accounting policy would not be retrospective and so would not impact on previously reported results.
The impact of this future change in accounting policy on the Groups financial statements is not reasonably estimable, as the nature of future borrowings, and the existence of qualifying assets is not yet known.
3 Significant accounting policies The consolidated financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and the Companies Act 1985 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial information includes the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of Wellstream Holdings PLC the Company and the enterprises under its control its subsidiaries.
Control is defined as the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.
Adjustments are made, where necessary, to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with Group policies.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Jointly controlled entities are those entities over which the Group has joint control established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of the entities assets, liabilities, income and expenses with items of similar nature on a line by line basis, from the date that joint control commences, until the date that joint control ceases.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business, fair values are attributed to the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, with impairments being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On the disposal of a business, goodwill relating to that business remaining on the balance sheet is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows:  Leasehold improvements - between 15 and 30 years  Freehold buildings - 30 years  Plant and equipment - between 3 and 15 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Property, plant and equipment is impaired if its recoverable amount falls below its carrying value.
Impairment losses are charged to the income statement immediately.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Wellstream Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 65 Notes to the Accounts continued | 65 Assets under construction represent buildings and plant pending installation, and are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Costs include construction and other directly attributable costs.
No provision for depreciation is made until such time when the assets are completed and ready for use.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their current location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the average cost method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash-in-hand and bank overdrafts, where there is right of offset.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
The directors have reconsidered the classification of interest received within the cash flow statement.
As a result interest received is now classified within operating activities as it represents interest received on operational working capital.
As a result of this change in accounting policy, the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before exchange gains on financing, finance income and finance expenses.
Recognition of revenue and costs under construction contracts The Group follows the generally accepted practice of accounting for construction contracts.
Under this method, revenue and costs are recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by reference to the extent to which obligations identified at the commencement of the contract are considered to have been met.
These obligations may be contractual or non-contractual.
Variations in contract work and incentive payments are included to the extent that they have been formally agreed with the customer.
Profit is only recognised where the outcome of a contract can be reliably estimated.
Typically, for pipe manufacture contracts, this means that profit is recognised on a stage of completion basis.
For installation contracts, profit is recognised in accordance with the risk profile of the contract as assessed by management.
The pattern of revenue recognition for installation contracts will depend on individual contract circumstances and terms.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that contract costs incurred will be recovered.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Recognition of revenue other than under construction contracts Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
With the exception of goods sold under construction contracts, sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities is charged as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs which are expected to generate probable future economic benefits are capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives.
All other development expenditure is charged to the income statement.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs.
Leasing Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for the year and takes into account current and deferred taxation.
The charge is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 66 66 | Notes to the Accounts continued The current tax charge is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenses that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred taxation is provided for all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Retirement benefits The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for eligible employees.
The pension costs are charged to the income statement as they become payable.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The amount charged against profits represents the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Foreign currencies The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at the market rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading results are translated at the average rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the consolidation of the investment in overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, together with those on foreign currency loans accounted for as net investment hedges, are taken to equity.
On the disposal of a business, the cumulative exchange differences previously recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve relating to that business are transferred to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Financial guarantee contract liabilities Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and are subsequently measured at the higher of:  the amount of the obligation under the contract, as determined in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: and  the amount initially recognised less, where appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognised in accordance with the revenue recognition policies set out above.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Finance income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Wellstream Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 67 Notes to the Accounts continued | 67 Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally foreign currency and interest rate swaps and caps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate movements.
The Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors.
Under IFRSs, derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The Group has chosen not to use hedge accounting to date and therefore changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Share based payments In accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments, the fair value of equity settled share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at the date of grant and the charge is only amended if vesting does not take place due to non-market conditions not being met.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of awards that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
With respect to share based payments, a deferred tax asset is recognised on the relevant tax base.
The tax base is then compared to the cumulative share based payment expense recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax arising on the excess of the tax base over the cumulative share based payment expense recognised in the income statement has been recognised directly in equity outside the SORIE as share based payments are considered to be transactions with shareholders.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises, in its own financial statements, an increase in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity based payment charge recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the corresponding credit being recognised in equity.
Key estimates and judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Management considers the key estimates and judgements made in the financial statements to be as follows:  Recognition of revenue and costs under construction contracts Revenue and costs under construction contracts are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date, where the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
Stage of completion is determined by reference to the extent to which obligations identified at the commencement of the contract are considered to have been met.
The determination of whether the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably, the stage of completion of contract activity and the probability that contract costs incurred will be recovered can be inherently difficult to estimate and require management judgement.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of construction contracts are regularly reviewed in light of the most current information available.
 Share based payments Share based payment charges are calculated based upon the fair value of equity settled options granted to employees of the Group.
The fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
These calculations require the use of estimates note 24.

IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Board to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
As a result, following the adoption of IFRS 8, the identification of the Groups reportable segments has changed.
The Groups reportable segments under IFRS 8 Operating Segments are therefore as follows: Offshore - The design, production and installation of flexible unbonded pipelines for use in the offshore oil and gas industry.
Onshore - The design and production of flexible unbonded pipelines for use in the onshore oil and gas industry.

48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 74 74 | Notes to the Accounts continued 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of the outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Basic and diluted earnings per share The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings Weighted Earnings Weighted average number average number of ordinary shares of ordinary shares 2007 2007 2006 2006 000 No.

The weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for all periods presented has been adjusted for certain bonus issues and redesignations described in note 23 that have changed the number of ordinary shares outstanding without a corresponding change in resources.
All redeemable non-voting shares were issued and redeemed during the period and hence no separate earnings per share figure has been presented.
At 1 January 2006 the Company had 2,000 warrants in issue for contingently issuable shares, and on 19 March 2007 it granted options for contingently issuable shares as described in note 23.
These are both excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2006 as the related conditions were not met until 1 May 2007 at which date the shares were issued.
The difference between the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the dilutive effect of the Companys Performance Share Plan, Save As You Earn scheme and Chairmans award.

Existing goodwill relates entirely to the initial purchase of the offshore business and has been allocated to that business, which is considered to be a single cash generating unit.
Upon further acquisitions goodwill acquired in a business will be allocated to the cash generating units that expect to benefit from that business acquired.
The basis on which the recoverable amount has been determined is the value in use.
The Group calculates the value in use of each cash generating unit by applying an appropriate discount rate based on the Groups borrowing profile, which was 10% at 31 December 2007.
This discount rate is applied to the pre-tax cash flows within the latest approved forecast and this is compared to the carrying value of its net assets in order to test for impairment.
No impairment of goodwill is evident for the year ended 31 December 2007.

The facility will reduce to nil over a six year period from 1 May 2007 to 1 May 2013, with staged reductions in the size of the facility occurring six monthly from 1 November 2008.
Although the overdraft forms part of the revolving credit facility, this element is repayable on demand.
Such a demand for repayment would result in a corresponding increase in the level of long term borrowings available, subject to the staged reductions in the overall size of the facility.
Interest on drawn funds is charged at a margin of between 1.00% and 2.25% above LIBOR, by reference to the Groups capital structure.
The average effective interest rate for the year was 7.56% in respect of term borrowings, and 7.08% in respect of overdrafts.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by fixed and floating charges over the net assets of Wellstream International Limited and a share pledge over that portion of Wellstream do Brazil Industrial e Servicos Ltda that is not secured under the Rio State Government loan see below.
At 31 December 2007 the Group had available 26,027,000 2006 - nil of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Rio State Government loan This facility is provided by the State Government of Rio fide Janeiro and has a maximum value of 21,280,000.
The loan is drawn down progressively on a monthly basis.
The value of the monthly draw down is calculated as the lesser of 9% of gross monthly revenue or 70% of the ICMS tax payable on sales in the month.
Interest on the Rio State Government loan is charged at 6.0%.
The average effective interest rate for the year was 6.0%.
Borrowings under the Rio State Government loan are secured by fixed and floating charges over certain items of plant and equipment with a carrying value of 4,368,000.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 21, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 25.
Financial risk management objectives The Board monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group.
These risks include market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Where appropriate, the Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is approved by the Finance Director and any such financial derivatives are reported to the Board of directors.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Market risk The Groups activities expose its financial instruments to risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes the bulk of its business in Sterling or in the local currency of its overseas operations.
Trade carried out in any other currency is by exception and as such any exposure to transactional currency risk can be easily identified.
In such circumstances natural hedges are first sought and if significant residual exposure exists, it is hedged using derivative financial instruments.
There were no such contracts in existence at the year end.
The Group has significant foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities by virtue of its overseas operations.
At the reporting date they were as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Brazilian Real 15,108 2,981 59,127 2,112 US Dollar 6,481 128,695 13,423 27,213 48723 MG Annual Report - End 17 4 08 11:37 Page 82 82 | Notes to the Accounts continued 22 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the Brazilian Real and US Dollar.
The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in Sterling against the relevant foreign currencies, being managements reasonable assessment of the possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity where Sterling strengthens 10% against the relevant currency.
For a 10% weakening of Sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.
Real impact US Dollar impact 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Recognised in equity 15,597 363 1,382 19,862 The Groups sensitivity to changes in the value of Sterling against the US Dollar has decreased during the current period mainly due to the settling of US dollar denominated debt.
The increase in the scale of operations in Brazil during the year has increased the Group's exposure to changes in the value of the Brazilian Real.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated monetary items arise primarily on consolidation and therefore are shown as recognised in equity in the table above.
Interest rate risk management and sensitivity analysis The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
At the period end fixed interest rate loans represented 90% of total borrowings and were for periods of less than three months.
The Group had no interest rate swaps at the year end.
If interest rates had been 0.5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 December 2007 would decrease increase by 298,000 2006: decrease increase by 297,000. Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group contracts all of its significant business in such a way that it receives regular stage payments from its customers that are appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract.
This payment profile is approved by senior management in advance of accepting the contract and is monitored subsequent to acceptance at regular intervals.
This approach and the Groups customer profile which consists largely of national and international oil companies with well established and substantial credit histories, significantly mitigates the risk of financial loss from default.
At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 there was credit risk associated with the concentration of the offshore business into a number of large contracts with a limited number of customers and counterparties.
Information about these major customers and their geographic profile is included in note 5.
No significant unrecovered receivables have arisen as a result of this risk.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of collateral obtained.

The facility offers the flexibility of repaying borrowings at one months notice.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of directors.
Liquidity risk arising from the maturity profile of financial assets is detailed in the credit risk section above.
The Group has access to financing facilities: the total unused amount at the balance sheet date is 31,382,000, being 26,027,000 of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in the UK and 5,355,000 of cash held overseas.

The directors therefore do not consider the Companys historic share price volatility to be a suitable basis on which to set an expectation for the purpose of option valuations.
Therefore the expected share price volatility was determined by reference to historic volatilities in the share prices of a selection of UK companies operating in the same industry as the Group.
The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural conditions and forfeiture.
The risk free rate has been determined by reference to yields on UK government gilts.
Prior to IPO share options were issued to Sir Graham Hearne, a non-executive director.
