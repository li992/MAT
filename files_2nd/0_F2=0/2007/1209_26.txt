Financial Statements Parent Company Financial Statements Statement of Directors Responsibilities United Kingdom company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at the end of the financial period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for the system of internal control, safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence to take reasonable steps to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.

uk Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 1 Accounting Policies The Aricom plc the Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles UK GAAP and in accordance with UK Company law.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
These have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act, the profit and loss account of the Parent Company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The profit after tax for the year of the Parent Company was US$25,600,000 2006: US$3,427,000.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption from providing financial instrument disclosures under the terms of FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
2 Change in Functional Currency In prior periods, the Company had determined that its functional currency was US dollars.
During the year, the Company raised a significant amount of funds by way of a placing of ordinary shares and warrants in the UK market.
Not only are these denominated in GB pounds with dividends being paid in GB pounds, but they also represent a strategic decision to raise funding in GB pounds on this occasion.
Accordingly the Directors found it necessary to reconsider the Companys functional currency and, as a consequence, have determined that the functional currency of the Company has changed to GB pounds.
The accounts continue to be presented in US dollars to aid comparison with other global mining companies.
3 Restatement of Comparatives During the current year the Directors have re-assessed the accounting treatment of the deferred consideration payable in respect of the acquisition of KS GOK in the 31 December 2006 balance sheet.
This has no effect on the value attributed to the assets, or the profit for the year reported in the published 2006 Financial Statements.
The deferred consideration in relation to the first 50% interest in KS GOK acquired from Malavasia Enterprises Inc. comprised ordinary shares, at an amount dependent on the outcome of the valuation.
Therefore, the consideration has now been accounted for in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based Payment as an equity-settled share-based payment and been classified as equity shares to be issued rather than as a current liability as previously reported.
This increased reported net assets as at 31 December 2006 by US$83.8 million.
These ordinary shares were issued during the current year, and hence this amount is no longer recognised at the balance sheet date.
4 Significant Accounting Policies Exploration and Evaluation Costs Exploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred except in respect of deposits where: It is expected that the expenditure will be recouped by future exploitation or sale: or Substantial exploration and evaluation activities have identified a mineral resource and these activities have reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially exploitable reserves.
Where either of the above conditions is met direct expenditure is capitalised.
Once production begins capitalised costs are written off to the profit and loss account so as to spread them over total proven and probable reserves on a units-of-production basis.
Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets represent licensed intellectual property purchased in relation to the processing of titanium sponge.
These intangibles are measured at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, which is a period of up to ten years, but dependent upon the start-up date of the titanium sponge plant.
Tangible Fixed Assets Mining Properties and Leases The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the cost of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.

Depreciation is provided on all such tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life or the life of the relevant licence, whichever is less, as follows: Average life in years Buildings 50 Plant and machinery 7-20 Office equipment 3-10 Computer equipment 4-6 Until they are brought into use fixed assets and equipment to be installed are included within assets under construction.
The cost of maintenance, repairs and replacement of minor items of tangible fixed assets are charged to the profit and loss account.
Renewals and betterments are capitalised.
Upon sale or retirement of tangible fixed assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the Financial Statements.
Any resulting gains or losses are included in the profit and loss account.
Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets Excluding Goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Foreign Currencies In preparing the financial statements of the Company, transactions in currencies other than the Companys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements in US dollars, the assets and liabilities of the Company are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that year, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised within equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit and loss for the period.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit and loss for the period.
Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Companys balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
uk Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continued 4 Significant Accounting Policies continued Trade Receivables Trade receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the profit and loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Other investments are classified as either held-for-trading or available-for-sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in net profit or loss for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for debt instruments classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Taxation Provision is made for all foreseeable taxation liabilities.
Deferred taxation is calculated so as to recognise the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous periods with the following exceptions: Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been declared and accrued as receivables: and Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profit from which the future reversal of the timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
There was no recognised deferred tax at 31 December 2006.
Pensions The Company does not operate either a defined benefit or a defined contribution scheme for its employees.
Contributions are made to individuals personal pension schemes where applicable under the terms of their employment contracts.
Share-based Payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees and under various contracts with third parties.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes or binomial model as deemed most appropriate for each individual issue.
The expected lives used in the models have been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based payments.

6 Other Intangible Assets Other intangibles assets represent amounts paid during the year ended 31 December 2007 to acquire licensed intellectual property in relation to the processing of titanium sponge.

Significant additions and changes to the Companys investment in Group companies are outlined below.
i At 31 December 2006, the deferred consideration in respect of the acquisition of the first 50% interest in KS GOK was estimated at US$83.8 million based on the market price of 65 million ordinary shares at market price of 0.6525 on 4 April 2007 being the date the independent valuation of K&S Deposits was obtained.
The 65 million ordinary shares were issued on 20 April 2007 when the price per share was 0.785.
This resulted in an increase in the Companys investment in KS GOK of US$18.5 million during the current year.
ii At 31 December 2006, other investments included an amount of US$19.8 million, representing the fair value of the Philotus option.
The Company exercised the Philotus option during the current year, acquiring the 50% interest in KS GOK it did not already own.
At the date of exercise of the Philouts option, an increase of US$32.4 million in the fair value of the option was recognised in the Income Statement.
The value of the Philotus option at the date of exercise US$52.2 million and the consideration paid for the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in KS GOK of US$131.1 million has been recognised in investments in Group companies at 31 December 2007.
