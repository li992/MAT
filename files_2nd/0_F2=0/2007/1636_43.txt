Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 3,105 3,795 Deferred tax assets 3,628 2,876 523 919 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 1,247,000 2006 2,317,000 available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses due to the unpredictably of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised deferred tax assets are losses of 498,000 2006 929,000 that will expire over the years 2010 to 2014 2006 2009 to 2013.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 16,500,000 2006 14,958,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.
