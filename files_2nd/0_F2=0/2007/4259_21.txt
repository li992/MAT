Categories of financial instruments 2007 2006 $000 $000 Financial assets Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits 157,378 95,388 Financial liabilities Amortised cost 227,146 59,372 At the reporting date there are no loans and receivables designated at fair value through profit and loss.

Financial risk management objectives The Group Treasury function provides services to the Company, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company.
The main risks the Company is exposed to are the currency risk component of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.

The Company does not enter into any financial derivative contracts.
The Company does not enter into, or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure of the Company to foreign currency movements for its non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10% against GBP sterling, the Companys: loss for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 would have decreased by $1,267,000.
The profit for the 52 week period ended 29 December 2006 would have decreased by $442,000.
In both periods, this is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to foreign exchange movements on Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities: there is no impact on other equity reserves 2006: $nil.
A 10% weakening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change in currency rates given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2006.
Interest rate risk management The company has no significant direct exposures to fluctuations in interest rates other than those on interest bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those cash balances in the period was 5.16% 2006: 5.00%.
94 CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2007 45 Financial instruments continued Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
