There has been no new issue of shares in relation to the Asset and Equity Plan.
Share option plans The company has share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the companys shares have been granted to certain executives and employees.
Options granted are normally exercisable not less than three years after their grant and will lapse on their tenth anniversary.
Options cannot be exercised until pre-determined performance conditions have been achieved.
Under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, eligible employees with six months or more continuous service can join the scheme.
Employees can save to a maximum of 250 per month through payroll deductions for a period of three or five years, after which time they can acquire shares at up to a 20 per cent discount.
Under the Share Incentive Plan employees are invited to make contributions to buy Partnership Shares.
If an employee agrees to buy Partnership Shares the company currently matches the number of Partnership Shares bought with an award of shares Matching Shares, on a one-for-one basis.

The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average exercise price of 3.85 and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.6 years.
The fair value of the options granted during the year was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model and is not material.
The company recognised a cost of US$7.8 million and US$3.0 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2007 and 2006 respectively.
Asset and Equity Plan The company currently operates an Asset and Equity Plan to reward employees for improvement in the asset value of the business and the market value of the company over a three-year period.
The plan has two bonus pools an equity bonus pool and an asset bonus pool.
The asset bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the equity bonus pool is created by reference to the increase in the equity market value per share of the company over a three-year period.
Full details about this plan have been provided in the Remuneration Report on pages 31 to 40.
The company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to calculate the value of the equity bonus pool of the plan.
The main assumptions used for the calculations are as follows: Volatility: 29.0% to 33.0% Risk free rate of interest: 3.9% to 4.9% Historic market value growth factor: 91.0% to 204.0% For the asset bonus pool a discounted cash flow model based on the average oil price over the period is used to calculate the final value of the pool and to estimate the value of future asset bonus pools.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the total cost recognised by the company for share-based payments is US$10.4 million 2006: US$17.5 million, with a cumulative liability on the balance sheet of US$12.3 million 2006: US$18.3 million and a cost of US$7.8 million recorded in equity 2006: US$3.0 million.
Like other elements of remuneration, this charge is processed through the time-writing system which allocates cost, based on time spent by individuals, to various entities within the Premier Oil group.
Part of this cost is therefore capitalised as directly attributable to capital projects and part is charged to the profit and loss account as exploration expense, operating costs, pre-licence exploration costs or general and administration costs.
