35 Pensions and other post-employment benefits a Summary of pension benefits and assumptions The UK Bus and UK Coach divisions operate both funded defined benefit schemes and a defined contribution scheme.
The majority of employees of the UK Trains companies are members of the appropriate shared-cost section of the Railways Pension Scheme RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The assets of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are determined by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Subsidiaries in North America contribute to a number of defined contribution plans.
The Group also provides certain additional unfunded post-employment benefits to employees in North America and Spain, which are disclosed in section c in the Other category.
The total pension cost for the year was 27.5m 2006: 23.9m, of which 3.2m 2006: 3.4m relates to the defined contribution schemes.
The defined benefit pension liability included in the balance sheet is as follows: 2007 2006 m m UK Bus 5.1 17.3 UK Coach 4.9 12.7 UK Trains 18.8 21.1 Other 1.0 1.7 Total 29.8 52.8 The valuations conducted for financial reporting purposes are based on the triennial actuarial valuations.
A summary of the latest triennial actuarial valuations, and assumptions made, is as follows.

For the RPS, mortality assumptions are based on the recent experience of the scheme with an allowance for future improvements in mortality.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is determined based on market returns on each category of scheme assets.
b Accounting for the Railways Pension Scheme The majority of employees of the UK Train companies are members of the appropriate section of the RPS, a funded defined benefit scheme.
The RPS is a shared cost scheme, which means that costs are formally shared 60% employer and 40% employee.
To date, the Group has experienced nine changes of UK Train franchise ownership where the current owner has funded the scheme during the franchise term and the pension deficit at franchise exit has transferred to the new owner, without cash settlement.
However, although the Groups past experience has proven otherwise, our legal advisors have opined that in certain situations, the liability for the deficit on the relevant sections of the RPS could theoretically crystallise for funding by an individual TOC at the end of the franchise.
By entering into the franchise contract, the TOC becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the rules of the RPS must fund its share of the pension liability in accordance with the schedule of contributions agreed with the Scheme trustees and actuaries and for which there is no funding cap set out in the franchise contract.
To comply with IAS 19, the Group is required to account for its legal obligation under the formal terms of the RPS and its constructive obligation that arises under the terms of each franchise agreement.
In determining the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the Groups accounts present fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows, management has consulted with TOC industry peers and has concluded that the Groups constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations should be accounted for in accordance with IAS 19.
This accounting policy, which in all other respects is consistent with that set out in this note for the Groups other defined benefit schemes, means that the Groups accounts reflect that element of the deficits anticipated to be settled by the Group during the franchise term and will prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new owner at franchise exit.
In calculating the Groups constructive obligations in respect of the RPS, the Group has calculated the total pension deficits in each of the RPS sections in accordance with IAS 19 and the assumptions set out above.
These deficits are reduced by a franchise adjustment which is that portion of the deficit projected to exist at the end of the franchise and for which the Group will not be required to fund.
The franchise adjustment, which has been calculated by the Groups actuaries, is offset against the present value of the RPS liabilities so as to fairly present the financial performance, position and cash flows of the Groups obligations.
The franchise adjustment decreased from 44.4m at 31 December 2006 to 2.3m at 31 December 2007.
The decrease is caused by interest on the franchise adjustment of 2.1m offset by net actuarial movements of 29.4m and by 14.8m relating to the franchise exits.
In the prior year, the franchise adjustment decreased by 26.6m from 71.0m at 1 January 2006 to 44.4m at 31 December 2006.
The decrease was caused by interest on the franchise adjustment of 2.5m offset by net actuarial movements in scheme liabilities of 6.7m and by 22.4m relating to franchise exits.
