FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The main financial risks arising in the normal course of the groups business are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
Derivative transactions relate to forward currency contracts used to manage the currency risks from the groups selling and buying activities.
Credit risk The group and company have a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on all new customers requiring credit cover over 1,000 and these are frequently reviewed by management to limit exposure.
Businesses must obtain central approval for credit limits in excess of 10,000.
The group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
Accounts Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 81 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED Credit risk - continued At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Balance at 1 January 1,859 1,814 Movement in year 14 45 Balance at 31 December 1,873 1,859 The movement in impairment loss during the year consists of an impairment loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, net of the utilisation of the credit loss allowance and foreign exchange movements.
Headlam Group plc 82 Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED Credit risk - continued Based on historic default rates, the group believes that no general impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables, however, the group provides fully for specific debts when required.
During the year the groups impairment loss as a percentage of revenue amounted to 0.20% 2006: 0.25%.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities all of which are due within one year: Group 2007 2006 Carrying Contractual Carrying Contractual amount Cash flows amount Cash flows 000 000 000 000 Trade and other payables note 18 154,320 154,320 149,422 149,422 Bank overdrafts note 16 103 103 1,010 1,010 Other interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 17 267 267 154,423 154,423 150,699 150,699 Company 2007 2006 Carrying Contractual Carrying Contractual amount Cash flows amount Cash flows 000 000 000 000 Trade and other payables note 18 38,271 38,271 40,663 40,663 Other interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 17 267 267 38,271 38,271 40,930 40,930 Interest rate risk The group and company are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on borrowings and cash deposits.
Borrowings are principally in sterling, euros and Swiss francs at both fixed and floating rates deposits in sterling, euros and Swiss francs at floating rates.
During the year, the group maintained its policy of borrowing at floating rates.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Group Company Carrying amount Carrying amount 2007 2006 2007 2006 000 000 000 000 Variable rate instruments Financial assets 16,805 41,861 30,135 40,221 Financial liabilities 103 1,277 267 16,702 40,584 30,135 39,954 There were no fixed rate instruments held by the group at 31 December 2007 2006 nil.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED Sensitivity analysis A change of 100 basis points in the interest rates at the reporting date would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2006.
Group Company Profit or loss Equity Profit or loss Equity 100bp 100bp 100bp 100bp 100bp 100bp 100bp 100bp increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 31 December 2007 Variable rate instruments 167 167 301 301 31 December 2006 Variable rate instruments 406 406 400 400 Foreign currency risk The group and company are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates arising from transaction currency cash flows and the translation of the results and net assets of overseas subsidiary operations.
These exposures, however, have not had a significant effect on the results and financial position of the group overall.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the euro and Swiss franc.
The group and company use forward exchange contracts to hedge their foreign currency transactional risk.
A future foreign currency contract would be entered into where there was a known requirement for the currency due to planned imports that are not invoiced in sterling.
These forward exchange contracts would have a maturity of less than one year after the balance sheet date.
The group also enters into foreign currency contracts at spot rate where the amounts are not frequent or material.
Gains and losses on currency contracts recognised as a liability as at 31 December 2007 amounted to 23,000 2006: 62,000.
For the twelve month period to 31 December 2007, 6.3% 2006: 4.7% of the groups operating profit was derived from overseas subsidiaries and at 31 December 2007, 10.8% 2006: 8.6% of the groups operating assets related to overseas subsidiary operations.
Hedge accounting, following the adoption of IFRS, has not been applied to these operations given their relative size and because of the onerous level of compliance required under IAS 39.
The group and company do not use derivatives other than as described above.
In managing interest rate and currency risks the group and company aim to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on company and groups earnings.
In the short term, income statement and net asset volatility arising from these exposures is not considered significant.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in interest rates and foreign exchange have the potential to impact the Consolidated Income Statement and carrying value of net assets.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED Fair values The carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet for financial instruments are a reasonable approximation to fair value.
Trade receivables, trade payables and cash and cash equivalents Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short term maturity of the instrument.
Borrowings, other financial assets and other financial liabilities Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Capital management The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The board closely monitors the shareholder base, divided yield and earnings per share.
The group has commenced a share buy-back programme, to return cash to shareholders and improve balance sheet efficiency.
There were no changes to the groups approach to capital management in the year.
