The schemes assets, which are administered by F&C, are held under the control of the Trustee and used to secure benefits for the members of the Scheme and their dependents in accordance with the Trust Deed and Rules.
The Trustee board consists of a Chairman who is appointed by the employer and 8 additional directors of which 4 are employer appointed directors, 3 member selected directors and 1 pensioner selected director.

Staff pension schemes continued ii Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions for pensioners are based on the appropriate 2000 series mortality tables 2006: 1992 series published by the Continuous Mortality Investigations CMI in 2006.
In addition, allowance is made for future improvements in mortality according to each individuals year of birth through the use of the medium cohort projections with certain amendments published by the CMI in 2002.
The amendments are to introduce a minimum annual rate of improvement in future mortality - for males this is assumed to be 1% pa and for females 0.75% pa.
The mortality assumptions provide the following average life expectancies of members retiring at the age of 60: 2007 2006 Expected age at death of future male pensioner 89 88 Expected age at death of future female pensioner 90 90 Expected age at death of current male pensioner 87 87 Expected age at death of current female pensioner 89 90 The present value of providing an annuity from the age of 60, based on the above life expectancies, for every one pound of pension accumulated, is as follows: Cost of annuities 2007 2006 Male annuity 24.67 24.68 Female annuity 23.45 23.81 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 5.51% 2006: 5.02%.
The rates also assume two thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse, a 5-year guarantee is provided and pensions in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension will increase by 3.40% 2006: 3.02% per annum.

x Future funding The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of FPPS was performed by an independent actuary and was carried out as at 30 September 2005.
From 1 July 2007 it has been decided to close the scheme to new members and existing members have been asked to increase their contributions of 3% by 1% per annum until 2010 if they wish to continue to retire at the age of 60, or reduce their contributions from 3% to 2% and increase their normal retirement age to 65.
Friends Provident has agreed to increase its contributions from 15% to 20%.
A new defined contribution plan has been introduced for new employees.
A draft Statement of Funding Principles is being agreed by the Group and the Trustee.
The statement provides the principles around assumption setting, in particular, choosing the discount rate, future price inflation, future pension increases, rates of mortality, future pay increases, employee turnover, pension commencement age, and typical partner or dependent information.
In addition the Trustee has the following objectives for investments, as set out in the Statement of Investment Principles:  To achieve and maintain a minimum funding level of 100% on a long-term ongoing basis: and  To maintain the cost of providing the benefits at an acceptable level to the Employer.
Amounts paid to FPPS in the past 2 years and expected future payments over the next 5 years are as follows: m Contributions paid 2006 14 2007 21 Contributions expected to be paid 2008 21 2009 20 2010 20 2011 20 2012 20 Friends Provident Annual Report & Accounts 2007 105 FP AnnRep 074-200. qxd:30349 Backend 27 3 08 03:23 Page 106 FINANCIAL ST FINANCIAL STA ATEMENTS TEMENTS IFRS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EEV SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 10.
Staff pension schemes continued xi Risk management The Trustee has established a separate investment subcommittee which is responsible for assisting the Trustee in investment policy and monitoring the Schemes investments.
The investment subcommittee seeks advice from the investment adviser and believes it has sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustee sets general investment policy but delegates day to day responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of Members voluntary contributions to the Investment Manager.
The Trustee has set performance and risk targets for the Investment Manager.
The performance objectives are long-term 5 years, however, the Trustee monitors the Investment Manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that it is on track to meet its long term objectives.
Interest rate and inflation risk In 2006, FPPS inflation swaps, Government bonds, and index linked bonds, were exchanged for positions in ten Liability Driven Investment LDI pools managed by F&C.
These pools are designed to achieve a good match to the interest rate and nominal sensitivities of the liabilities of FPPS liabilities.
In 2007, FPPS increased its holding in LDI pools further to implement a revised strategy of 60% LDI exposure and 40% equity exposure.
The value of investment in LDI pools at 31 December 2007 was 460m 2006: 256m.
Currency risk To increase the diversification of the equity portfolio, the Scheme invests in overseas assets.
The Schemes liability is entirely in pounds Sterling and therefore there is a risk that the appreciation of UK sterling against other currencies will reduce the return from overseas equities.
The Trustee has reviewed this risk and hedged one third of the overseas exposure.
Operational risk The Investment Manager does not directly hold any of the Schemes securities.
These are held in a separate account with the custodian.
All organisations involved in stock lending are kept under review by the Investment Managers credit committee.
The borrowing organisations have to post collateral with the Scheme, which is marked to market on a daily basis.

Staff pension schemes continued d F&C Asset Management plc pension schemes F&C operates a defined benefit scheme in the United Kingdom, one in The Netherlands, one in the Republic of Ireland, and participates in one in Portugal.
The UK scheme is closed to new entrants.
All new UK employees are eligible to benefit from defined contribution arrangements, which provide greater certainty over the future cost to F&C.
On 31 March 2007 the F&C Management Pension Plan was merged into the ISIS Asset Management plc Pension Fund as part of a rationalisation of UK employment arrangements.
The new scheme was renamed the F&C Asset Management Pension Plan FCAM.
In the past, where F&C was unable to separately identify its share of assets and liabilities in overseas multi-employer defined benefit schemes, these schemes were accounted for as defined contribution plans.
Prior to the Merger of F&C and ISIS in 2004, employee benefits in Ireland were provided through the multi-employer Friends First pension scheme.
In 2006 a separate pension plan was established and in 2007 employees decided whether to transfer into the new plan, or accept a defined contribution alternative.
The new plan maintained the existing benefits enjoyed previously by employees in Ireland.
Until the member decisions had been finalised, the pension plan in Ireland was accounted for as a defined contribution multi-employer scheme.
The F&C share of assets and liabilities for this scheme is now separately identifiable and are included as a defined benefit scheme from 1 January 2007.
A separate exercise is being conducted to make an assessment of any final transfer value receivable from Eureko in respect of the non-UK schemes acquired as part of the acquisition in 2004.
The exercise is now complete and Eureko paid F&C 2.4m in January 2008.
The Chairman of F&C, Mr RW Jenkins, was awarded pension benefits by F&C Management Limited prior to completion of the merger of ISIS and F&C in respect of his past service to F&C.
This is an unfunded pension liability and therefore the Group has made an appropriate provision in its accounts.
The results of the latest full actuarial valuations were updated at 31 December 2007 by qualified independent actuaries.
The information given below reflects the aggregate disclosures in respect of all defined benefit pension arrangement.

Staff pension schemes continued ii Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions for pensioners are based on the appropriate 1992 series mortality tables 2006: 1992 series published by the CMI.
In addition, allowance is made for future improvements in mortality according to each individuals year of birth through the use of the medium cohort projections published by the CMI in 2002, reduced by one year of age.
In 2006 projections of future improvements in mortality were based on typical year of birth of 1935 for current pensioners and 1965 for future pensioners.
The mortality assumptions provide the following average life expectancies of members retiring at the age of 60: 2007 2006 Expected age at death of future male pensioner 89 88 Expected age at death of future female pensioner 92 91 Expected age at death of current male pensioner 88 86 Expected age at death of current female pensioner 91 89 In The Netherlands the mortality assumption was updated to the Prognosetafel 2008-2050.
The corresponding assumption used at 31 December 2006 was the industry standard table Coll 2003.
The change in assumption led to an increase of approximately 2.5% in liabilities for The Netherlands scheme.
The present value of providing an annuity from the age of 60, based on the above life expectancies, for every one pound of pension accumulated, is as follows: Cost of annuities 2007 2006 Male annuity 23.50 24.50 Female annuity 24.00 25.00 These rates assume a monthly payments model with a discount rate of 5.6% 2006: 5.00% based on the iBoxx over 15 year AA corporate bond index of 5.82% 2006: 5.12%.
The rates also assume two-thirds of the members benefit will be paid to the spouse, a 5-year guarantee is provided and pensions in excess of GMP will increase by 3.3% 2006: 3.00% per annum.

x Future Funding requirements UK schemes The Trustees of the ISIS Fund and F&C Pension Plan merged the schemes on 31 March 2007 into the FCAM Plan.
This was achieved by the transfer of all of the defined benefit assets and liabilities from the F&C Fund into the ISIS Fund.
The assets and liabilities were merged on a co-mingled basis ie they will not be separately identifiable into F&C Fund or ISIS Fund sections.
In conjunction with this merger, special employer contributions totalling 8m were paid into the ISIS Fund around the time of the merger with a view to improving the funding level of the merged scheme.
Following the merger, a formal actuarial valuation was initiated dated 31 March 2007.
This actuarial valuation is still ongoing.
This valuation will be subject to the requirements of the scheme funding regulations introduced under the Pensions Act 2004 and the funding principles are to be agreed between the trustees of the merged scheme and F&C.
The results of this formal valuation will help to determine the future level of employer contributions to the merged scheme.
Until such time as any revision to employer contributions is agreed following this valuation, it is anticipated that employer contributions will continue initially at 25% of pensionable salaries for ex-ISIS Fund members and at 29.9% of pensionable salaries for ex-F&C Pension Plan members.

Staff pension schemes continued Overseas schemes Given possible changes in overseas pension provisions for example the recent establishment of new schemes, there is some uncertainty over the future level of employer contributions that may be required.
The figures in the table below assume that contributions at the level paid in 2007 continue for the overseas schemes.
Contributions to defined benefit schemes Amounts paid into F&Cs Groups defined benefit schemes in the past two years and expected future payments over the next five years are as follows: m Contributions paid 2006 4 2007 12 Contributions expected to be paid 2008 4 2009 4 2010 4 2011 4 2012 4 xi Risk Management UK scheme The Trustees set general investment policy but delegate the responsibility for the selection of specific investments other than investments in respect of members voluntary contributions to the investment manager.
The Trustees regularly monitor the Plans investments.
The Trustees seek advice from their investment adviser and believe they have sufficient skills and expertise to make investment decisions based on this advice.
The Trustees have set performance and risk targets for the investment manager.
The performance objectives are long-term, however, the Trustees monitor the investment manager on a regular basis in order to ensure that the scheme is on track to meet its long-term objectives.
Prior to the merger of the two schemes, both sets of Trustees conducted an asset-liability review.
These studies were used to assist the Trustees and F&C to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the liabilities within the schemes, subject to an acceptable funding cost to F&C.
The results of the studies were also used to assist the Trustees and F&C in managing volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the schemes deficits by providing information used to determine the schemes investment strategy.
A further asset-liability review is being undertaken alongside the actuarial valuation of the merged plan.
Asset allocation Following the pre-merger asset-liability reviews, both sets of trustees agreed with F&C that they would implement a Liability Driven Investment LDI approach to their investment strategy.
In both cases this involves the use of pooled LDI products managed by F&C.
The exact details of the investment strategy and asset allocation for the merged plan for the future are still being considered.
Interest rate and inflation risk The LDI pools are intended to help provide a degree of matching to the liabilities of the scheme.
Each pool comprises zero coupon derivatives with the same maturity as the expected cash flows of the scheme.
Each pool has leveraged exposure of varying amounts to inflation and interest rates.
The pools are valued using the market values of the underlying securities.
The assets are ring fenced from F&Cs creditors and are therefore transferable.
