Cash ow hedges At 31 December 2007, the group held futures currency contracts and cylinders that were being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast transactions, as well as cross-currency interest rate swaps to x the US dollar interest rate and US dollar redemption value, with matching critical terms on the currency leg of the swap with the underlying non-US dollar debt issuance.
Note 28 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency and interest rate risk.
For cash ow hedges the group only claims for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to profit or loss.
There were no highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been claimed that have not occurred and no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.
For cash ow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the period and included in the income statement is a gain of $74 million 2006 $93 million and 2005 $36 million loss.
Of this, a gain of $143 million is included in production and manufacturing expenses 2006 $162 million gain and 2005 $33 million gain and a loss of $69 million is included in finance costs 2006 $69 million loss and 2005 $69 million loss.
The amount removed from equity during the period and included in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a gain of $40 million 2006 $6 million gain and nil for 2005.
The amounts retained in equity at 31 December 2007 are expected to mature and affect the income statement by a $48 million gain in 2008, a loss of $10 million in 2009 and a gain of $28 million in 2010 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2007, the group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on xed rate debt issued by the group.
The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the hedging is highly effective.
The gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in 2007 was $334 million 2006 $257 million offset by a loss on the fair value of the finance debt of $327 million 2006 $257 million loss.
The interest rate and currency swaps have an average maturity of one to two years, 2006 two to three years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated borrowings into US dollar oating rate debt.
Note 28 outlines the groups approach to interest rate risk management.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group holds currency swap contracts as a hedge of a long-term investment in a UK subsidiary expiring in 2009.
At 31 December 2007, the hedge had a fair value of $40 million 2006 $107 million and the loss on the hedge recognized in equity in 2007 was $67 million 2006 $105 million gain, 2005 $58 million gain.
US dollars have been sold forward for sterling purchased and match the underlying liability with no significant ineffectiveness reected in the income statement.
US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $2,880 million 2006 $2,744 million with earliest contractual repayment dates within one year have expected repayment dates ranging from 1 to 35 years 2006 1 to 34 years.
The bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates: however, any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when internally assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
Similar treatment is applied for loans associated with long-term gas supply contracts totalling $1,899 million 2006 $1,976 million that mature over 10 years.
