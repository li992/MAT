qxd 28 2 08 20:54 Page 90 Morgan Sindall Report and Accounts 2007 Significant accounting policies for the year ended 31 December 2007 Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Fixed asset investments Except as stated below, investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
Fixed assets and depreciation No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
On other assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold property 2% per annum Plant, machinery, motor vehicles and equipment Between10% and 33% per annum Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and laws.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in tax computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pensions The expense of defined benefit liabilities is determined using the projected unit method and charged to the profit and loss account based on actuarial assumptions at the beginning of the financial year.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the combined statement of movements in reserves and shareholders funds in the period in which they occur.
Net pension obligations are included in the balance sheet at the present value of the scheme liabilities, less the fair value of the scheme assets.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share-based payments The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-Based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled, sharebased payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a modified Black-Scholes model.
None of these awards when granted was subject to a share price related performance condition.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services received is recognised at the current fair value determined at each balance sheet date for cash-settled, share-based payments.
Dividends The Company has adopted FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date and accordingly only recognises a liability once there is an obligation to pay.
As a result a dividend will only be recognised once the shareholders approve it.

3 Loss profit of the parent company The Company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and consequently the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these accounts.
The loss of the parent company for the financial year amounted to 5.5m 2006: a profit of 39.2m.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 0.2m 2006: 0.2m of such losses due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
7 Financial instruments The financial instruments, excluding short-term debtors and creditors comprise cash or overdrafts and loan notes.
The directors consider the fair value not to be materially different to the carrying value for financial instruments.
The Company holds part of its cash as sterling deposits with counterparties, which are at a fixed rate based on LIBOR and for periods not exceeding three months.
The objective of placing these deposits with financial institutions approved by the Board is to maximise interest received.
By placing surplus funds with approved counterparties the Companys risk profile is not significantly changed from maintaining funds with the Companys clearing bank.
There are no amounts included within cash at bank and in hand 2006: nil which is not accessible within 24 hours without penalty.
During the year under review the Company did not enter into derivative transactions and has not undertaken trading in any financial instruments.
qxd 28 2 08 20:54 Page 93 Notes to the Company financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 8 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution scheme The Morgan Sindall Retirement Benefits Plan the Plan was established on 31 May 1995 and operates on defined contribution principles for employees of the Group.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the Trustees of the Plan.
The total cost charged to income of 0.5m 2006: 0.2m represents contributions payable to the defined contribution section of the Plan by the Company at rates specified in the Plan rules.
As at 31 December 2007, contributions of 0.1m 2006: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the Plan.
Defined benefits scheme The Plan includes some defined benefit liabilities and transfers of funds representing the accrued benefit rights of former active and deferred members and pensioners of pension plans of companies which are now part of the Group.
These include final salary related benefits for members in respect of benefits accrued before 31 May 1995.
No further defined benefit membership rights can accrue after that date.
Under the Plan, employees are entitled to retirement benefits at a retirement age of 65.
No other retirement benefits are provided.
The Plan is currently being funded.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan was undertaken on 5 April 2007 and was prepared using assumptions of a rate of investment return of 6.0% per annum, a rate of earnings escalation of 4.5% per annum and rate of inflation of 3.5% per annum.
The ongoing liabilities of the Plan were assessed using the projected unit method whereas the assets were taken at realisable market value.
The actuarial valuation referred to showed that the defined benefit liabilities were partly funded and, on an ongoing basis, the value of the assets of 4.7m represented 59% of the value of these liabilities.
The actuarial valuation also showed that the realisable market value of the Plans assets was 81% of its minimum liabilities when assessed on the Minimum Funding Requirement basis as defined in the Pensions Act 1995.
The next triennial valuation will be carried out as at 5 April 2010 when the funding position will be re-appraised.
The most recent valuation of the Plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit liabilities was as at 31 December 2007.
The present value of the defined benefit liabilities, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit method.
