2 On 30 May 2006, Vodafone Group Plc announced a return of capital to shareholders via a B share scheme and associated share consolidation.
At the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 25 July 2006, shareholders approved the scheme, with a B share of 15 pence issued for each existing issued ordinary share held at the close of business on 28 July 2006 and the consolidation of existing ordinary shares on the basis of 7 new ordinary shares for 8 existing ordinary shares.
On 31 July 2006, the new ordinary shares were admitted to the London Stock Exchange official list, and commenced trading.
A total of 66,271,035,240 B shares were issued on that day, and 66,271,035,240 existing ordinary shares of 10 US cents each were consolidated into 57,987,155,835 new ordinary 3 shares of 11 7 cents each.
3 B shareholders were given the alternatives of initial redemption or future redemption at 15 pence per share or the payment of an initial dividend of 15 pence per share.
The initial redemption took place on 4 August 2006 with future redemption dates on 5 February and 5 August each year until 5 August 2008 when the Company expects to exercise its right to redeem all B shares still in issue at their nominal value of 15 pence.
B shareholders that chose future redemption are entitled to receive a continuing non-cumulative dividend of 75 per cent of Sterling LIBOR payable semi-annually in arrears until the B shares are redeemed.
The continuing B share dividend is shown within financing costs in the income statement.
The B shares which received an initial dividend immediately converted to deferred shares and all outstanding deferred shares were redeemed on 7 August 2006 for a total consideration of 1 pence and subsequently cancelled.
In relation to the ordinary shares held as treasury shares, the Company elected to receive a B share initial dividend, which was subsequently waived.
B shareholders are only entitled to receive notice of or attend, speak or vote at any general meeting if the business includes a resolution for the winding up of the Company.
If the Company is wound up, the holders of the B shares are entitled, before any payment to the ordinary shareholders, to repayment of the amount paid up on each B share together with any outstanding entitlement to the B share continuing dividend.
By 31 March 2007, total capital of 9,004 million had been returned to shareholders, 5,713 million by way of capital redemption and 3,291 million by way of initial dividend note 21.
The outstanding B share liability at 31 March 2007 has been classified as a financial liability and is disclosed within long term borrowings.
A transfer of 9,004 million in respect of the B shares has been made from retained losses note 23 to the capital redemption reserve note 21.
The redemptions and initial dividend are shown within cash flows from financing activities in the cash flow statement.
