49 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2007 1.
Capital reorganisation and change of name Capital reorganisation During the year the Company reorganised its single class of ordinary shares into two classes of shares, Growth shares and Income shares, each of which has rights over the capital and revenue of a discrete pool of assets.
Shareholders were given the opportunity to reclassify and subdivide their holdings of ordinary shares into Income shares on the basis of ten Income shares for every ordinary share in respect of which an election was made.
Such reclassification and subdivision took effect on 2nd August 2006.
The remaining shares were reclassified as Growth shares on the basis of five Growth shares for every one ordinary share.
The movements in the Companys share capital during the year are given note 18 on page 58.
Change of name At the same time as the capital reorganisation, the Company changed its name from JPMorgan Fleming Continental European Investment Trust plc to JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc.
Comparative figures The Companys accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006 have been presented as comparatives for the results of the Growth pool because the Growth pool has maintained materially the same economic exposure as if the reorganisation had not been implemented.
The investment objective, investment policy, benchmark and management fee arrangements have remained the same as for the ordinary shares in issue prior to the reorganisation.
There are no comparatives for the income statement of the Income pool.
The unaudited balance sheet of the Income pool on 2nd August, which was the effective date of the reorganisation, is presented as a comparative.
This balance sheet comprises the assets and liabilities transferred in accordance with the terms contained in the shareholder circular dated 7th July 2006.
Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP issued by the AIC in December 2005.
The accounting policies applied to these accounts are consistent with those applied in the accounts for the year ended 31st March 2006.
However, the Directors have further adopted new accounting bases following the capital reorganisation during the year and these are given in parts d and g to this note.
The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the measurement at fair value of investments.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from the total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with documented investment strategy and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to the acquisition which are written off to the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which for listed investments are bid market prices.
T H E C O M P A N Y JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 50 3.
Accounting Policies continued b Valuation of investments continued Where trading in securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
Unlisted and restricted investments are valued at fair value by the Board.
In making its valuations, the Board takes into account, where appropriate, latest dealing prices, valuations from reliable sources, asset values and other relevant factors.
Changes in the fair value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses on disposal are included in the capital column of the income statement within Gains or losses from investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are also included within this caption.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable are included in the revenue column of the income statement on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is included in the revenue column.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is included in the capital column.
Stock lending income and interest receivable are included in the revenue column on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses charged to the Company common to both pools are allocated to the pools in the same proportion as their net assets at the month end immediately preceding the date on which the cost is to be accounted for.
Expenses charged to the Company in relation to a specific pool are charged directly to that pool, with the other pool remaining unaffected.
Losses of one pool are not borne by the other.
Shareholders subsequently converting some or all of their shares into shares of the other class will bear the costs of the conversion up to a maximum of 2% of the value of the shares being converted.
Any costs in excess of this cap will be borne by all the shareholders of the Company.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: the costs of the share capital reorganisation have been allocated to the capital column.
Such costs, which include advisers fees, printing and other ancillary costs have been borne by the Company as a whole and charged to the Growth pool and Income pool pro rata in accordance with their aggregate net asset values at the date of the reorganisation.
The share of reorganisation costs attributable to the Income pool was deducted from the assets transferred to that pool at the date of the reorganisation and the whole amount of the reorganisation costs was then charged to capital in the Growth pool.
the cost of the initial reclassification, which includes administrative costs, the costs of realigning the gearing of the Income pool and the realigning of the portfolio of the Income pool have been allocated to the capital column of the Income pool.
performance fees payable to the manager in respect of both pools are allocated 100% to capital.
the management fees of the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
the management fees of the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are charged to the capital column.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
In accordance with the SORP, disclosure of transaction costs is required and can be found in note 12.
T H E C O M P A N Y 51 JPMorgan European Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Accounts continued 3.
Accounting Policies continued e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.. Finance costs on the Income pool of assets are allocated 40% to the revenue column and 60% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Income investment portfolio.
Finance costs on the Growth pool of assets are allocated 30% to the revenue column and 70% to the capital column in line with the Boards expected split of revenue and capital return from the Growth investment portfolio.
f Financial instruments Cash at bank and in hand may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other receivables do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk arising from interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments : Measurement, such derivative instruments are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet.
Gains or losses arising on the fair value of cash flow hedges during the year are shown in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and are accounted for in Other reserve, which was created specifically for that purpose.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax is computed for each portfolio separately.
A pool which generates taxable revenues in excess of tax deductible expenses may benefit from the excess of tax deductible expenses in the other pool.
In this instance compensation amounting to half the tax savings in the taxable pool will be transferred to the non taxable pool.
h Functional currency In accordance with FRS23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that Sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the revenue column of the income statement or the capital column, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
i Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, final dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.

This has arisen from deductible expenses exceeding taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is unlikely that this asset will be fully utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments a Management of risk The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments in Continental European equity shares, collective investment funds with Continental European exposure and liquidity funds which are all held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: Short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: Forward currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities: A bank loan and an issue of floating rate notes, both denominated in Euros: and Interest rate swaps, the purpose of which is to hedge the variability in cash flows arising from interest rate fluctuations on the bank loan and floating rate notes.
The Company is an investment trust and invests in shares and securities for the long term.
It is the Companys policy that no short term trading in investments or other financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Companys operations are market price risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk.
A description of these risks is given below, together with the Boards policy for managing these risks where appropriate.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss which the Company might incur as a result of holding a portfolio of investments when market prices fall.
The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
An investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through a bank loan and an issue of floating rate notes.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to fix the interest rates payable on these instruments and thereby eliminate the variability in cash flows arising from interest rate fluctuations.
Credit risk The Companys financial assets are bank balances, debtors and investments, which represent the Companys maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
When buying and selling investments, the Company is exposed to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment or cash.
The Company will only deal with brokers which have been approved by JPMAM and banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Limits have been set as to the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time.
The Company has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties.
Foreign currency risk The Company has exposure to foreign currency as part of the risk reward inherent in a company that invests overseas.
The income and capital value of the the Companys investments can be affected by exchange rate movements as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling which is the reporting currency.
The Board has identified four principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in rates that affect the value of the portfolio: movements in rates that affect the value of income received: movements in rates that affect the value of loans: and movements in rates that affect cash payments and receipts in the short term.
The Companys policy of borrowing in Euro denominated loans acts to reduce the impact which fluctuations in the Euro exchange rate have on the value of the Companys investments.
The Company may also use forward currency contracts to manage the exposure to foreign currency movements.
In the course of its investing operations, the Company may be exposed to currency risk over short terms, for example in the period between investment trade date and the date of settlement.
This exposure is not material.
