Adoption of new and revised standards and interpretations Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments and does not have any impact on the classication and valuation of the Groups financial statements, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments, where the identiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued in order to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
This standard does not have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment, prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 but they are not relevant to the Groups operations: IRFS 4, Insurance contracts: IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, financial reporting in hyper-inationary economies: and IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of embedded derivatives.
Standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective Standards, amendments and interpretation to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing costs effective from 1 January 2009.
The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing borrowing costs is removed.
The Group will apply the amendment from the annual period commencing 1 January 2009 and its impact is currently being assessed.
IFRS 8 Operating segments effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 amends the current segmental reporting requirements of IAS 14 and requires management approach to be adopted so that segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
This standard will apply from the annual period commencing 1 January 2009 and is expected to impact the Group by requiring additional disclosures in the financial statements.
IFRIC11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
IFRIC 11 provides guidance on whether sharebased transactions involving treasury shares or Group entities should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand alone accounts of the parent and Group companies.
This interpretation does not have an impact on the Groups financial statements.

Taxation outside the UK is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
Deferred tax recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense is due to actuarial gains on post-retirement liabilities at the prevailing rate in the relevant jurisdiction.
This includes the effect of the change in the UK rate of corporation tax from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 1 April 2008.
2007 2006 The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows: m m Loss profit before tax 19.5 405.6 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2006: 30% 5.9 121.7 Under over provision in respect of prior years 3.5 8.1 Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures 2.6 4.8 Tax effect of expenses that are not deductible in determining taxable profit 14.0 4.8 Non taxable income 18.9 22.5 Effect of higher rates of tax of subsidiaries operating in other jurisdictions 14.5 19.8 Losses not recognised 12.1 Net reduction in US tax assets recognised 189.4 Other 0.1 4.1 Tax charge for the year 177.2 115.0 The tax charge for the year includes an amount in respect of exceptional items of 70.2m.
This is made up of a credit of 14.9m in respect of UK tax and a net charge of 85.1m in respect of US tax.
The charge in the US reects a write-off of US deferred tax assets held by the Group which are not seen as capable of usage in the forseeable future primarily due to the significant weakening of the US market in the second half of 2007.

Goodwill of 694.3m 2006: 357.5m is allocated to the UK Housing business.
Goodwill of 5.5m 2006: 5.6m is allocated to the US Housing business.
The recoverable amount in respect of UK Housing has been determined on the basis of the business value in use.
The value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the cash-generating unit over the next 20 years.
Key assumptions used in the calculation are: i Gross margins are based upon past experience and latest forecasts which incorporate expectations of future changes in the market.
ii Growth rate applied for the period beyond three years is 0 per cent.
iii A pre-tax discount rate of 12 per cent based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
As a result of this review no impairment was recorded.

The prior year income statement was credited with 1.4m of the 2.4m net surplus on revaluation in line with prior years deficit treatment.
The revaluation surplus arises in a subsidiary and cannot be distributed to the parent due to legal restrictions in the United Kingdom.

Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting year.

In addition the total asset has reduced by 3.9m due to the re-evaluation of share schemes yet to vest at the end of 2007.
2.6m of this has been recorded as a reduction in the share-based payment tax reserve, see note 30.
Deferred tax on the UK timing differences has been calculated at the rate of 28 per cent 2006: 30 per cent.
The effect of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 1 April 2008 has resulted in a reduced net deferred tax asset at the end of 2007 of an amount of 2.5m.
Of this 2.5m, 2.3m has been charged directly to the statement of recognised income and expense.
The net deferred tax balance is analysed into assets and liabilities as follows: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax assets 117.7 95.4 Deferred tax liabilities 29.8 0.8 87.9 94.6 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused UK capital losses of 418.0m 2006: 187.2m, of which 296.8m 2006: 62.5m are agreed available for offset against future capital profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses because the directors do not consider that these capital losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
In addition some of the capital losses would be further restricted as to offset dependent on the source within the enlarged Group of any gains and previous losses.
The Group has not recognised potential deferred tax assets of 189.4m 2006: nil primarily relating to inventory adjustments in respect of the US and a further 9.7m 2006: 3.9m relating to tax losses in other jurisdictions.
These are not recognised principally due to the uncertainty of future profits against which to offset such potential deductions and losses.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.
Inventories 2007 2006 m m Raw materials and consumables 2.3 2.3 Finished goods and goods for resale 106.4 58.7 Residential developments Land 3,879.4 1,857.2 Development and construction costs 2,019.6 999.1 Commercial, industrial and mixed development properties 10.1 29.2 6,017.8 2,946.5 Details of land creditors are in note 21.
The Directors consider all inventory to be current in nature.
The operational cycle is such that the majority of inventory will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specic inventory will be realised, as this will be subject to a number of issues such as consumer demand and planning permission delays.
Non-refundable land option payments of 59.6m 2006: 28.2m are recorded within Residential developments:Land.

Financial instruments Capital management The Group operates within policies and procedures approved by the Board.
The Groups capitalisation policy established last year sets overall parameters for the consolidated capital structure designed to maintain a strong credit rating and an appropriate funding structure.
The Group seeks to match long term assets with long term funding and short term assets with short term funding.
Equity, retained profits and long term xed interest debt are used primarily to finance intangible assets, xed assets and land.
Short term borrowings are required primarily to finance net current assets, other than landbank assets of more than one year, and work in progress.
Cash balances made available by our construction business are used to reduce our short term borrowing requirements.
Net debt as a percentage of equity was 38.2% 2006: 18.6% however, the Group aims to maintain a strong credit rating by seeking to keep year end modied net gearing dened as borrowings less cash or cash equivalents as a percentage of tangible net assets adjusted for deferred tax assets and retirement benefit obligations between 40% and 60% and interest cover greater than 5 times but less than 7 times.
The forecast numbers are reviewed regularly.
Modied net gearing on this basis was 46.9% 2006: 21.1%.
Interest cover profit on ordinary activities before exceptional items and finance costs divided by finance costs less interest receivable was 4.2 2006: 7.3.

The Group aims to manage the exposure to these risks by the use of xed or oating rate borrowings, foreign currency borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
a Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the Group borrows funds at both xed and oating interest rates.
The exposure to these borrowings varies during the year due to the seasonal nature of cash ows relating to housing sales and the less certain timing of land acquisitions.
A combination of xed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps are used to manage the volatility risk such that at the year end, taking all interest rate derivatives into account, xed rate borrowings are not more than 70% of total borrowings but not less than 50%.
In order to measure the risk, oating rate borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year is forecast on a monthly basis and compared to budget using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
Group policy does not allow the use of derivatives to speculate against changes to future interest rates and they are only used to manage exposure to volatility.
The Groups exposure to, and the way in which it manages interest rate risk, has not changed from the previous year.
Hedge accounting Hedging activities are evaluated periodically to ensure that they are in line with policy.
The cross currency, xed to oating interest rate swaps have been bifurcated for hedging purposes and designated as fair value hedges such that the Group receive interest at a xed rate of 6.625% based on a nominal of 100m matching the underlying borrowing and pay US$ oating rates on a nominal of US$160.5m.
During the period the hedge was 100% effective 2006: 100% in hedging the fair value exposure to interest rate movements and as a result the carrying amount of the loan was increased by 1.7m 2006: reduced by 3.7m which was included in the income statement offsetting the fair value movement of the bifurcated interest rate swap.
As a result of the merger in July 2007 the Group acquired a number of derivatives which, while providing an economic hedge to the volatility of interest rates, do not satisfy the strict requirements for hedge accounting and are therefore designated as held for trading.
Interest rate sensitivity The effect on both income and equity determined based on exposure to non derivative oating rate instruments at the balance sheet date for a 1% rise in interest rates is 5.8 m 2006: 2.3m, before tax, a 1% fall in interest rates gives the same but opposite effect.
For derivatives the fair values have been calculated based on market quoted rates adjusted for the sensitivity as shown in the tables below.
Due to seasonal uctuations the level of net borrowings at the financial year end are not representative of net borrowings during the year and therefore interest rate sensitivity before tax for a reasonably possible 1% rise in oating rate instruments as shown below is based on a monthly average for the current period.
The table assumes all other variables remain constant and in accordance with IFRS 7 does not attempt, for example, to include the effects of any resultant change in exchange rates.

The Group is not materially exposed to transaction risks as nearly all Group companies conduct their business in their respective functional currencies.
Construction has certain contracts in non functional currencies and aims to match its expenditure in the same currency to reduce risk and these risks are not material in relation to the Group.
Group policy requires that transaction risks are hedged to the functional currency of the subsidiary using foreign currency borrowings or derivatives where appropriate.
The Group is also exposed to the translation risk of accounting for both the income and the net investment held in functional currencies other than.
The net investment risk is partially hedged using foreign currency borrowings and derivatives.
Assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies are retranslated each month using the latest 80 www.
Financial instruments continued exchange rates and resultant exchange gains or losses monitored each month.
Income is also measured monthly using the latest exchange rates and compared to a budget held at historic exchange rates.
Other than the natural hedge provided by foreign currency borrowings the translation risk of income is not hedged using derivatives.
The policy is kept under periodic review.
The Groups exposure to, and the way in which it manages, exchange rate risk has not changed from the previous year.
Hedge accounting The Group designates the bifurcated cross currency swaps such that the nominal amount of US$160.5m 2006: US$160.5m is used to hedge part of the Groups net investment in US$ denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group has also designated the carrying value of US$982.5m 2006: US$250.0m borrowings as a net investment hedge of part of the Groups investment in US$ denominated assets.
During the period the hedges were 100% effective 2006: 100% and as a result the change in the carrying amount of the derivatives and the change in the carrying value of the borrowings offset the exchange movement on the Groups US dollar net investment and are therefore included in the translation reserve.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Group is primarily exposed to US dollars, Canadian dollars and the Euro.
The following table details how the Groups income and equity would increase decrease on a before tax basis, to a 10% increase in the respective currencies against and in accordance with IFRS 7 all other variables remaining constant.
A 10% decrease in the value of would have an equal but opposite effect.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks in accordance with a policy that species the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored and remains within acceptable limits.
Land receivables arise from sales of surplus land on deferred terms.
A policy is in place such that if the risk is not acceptable then the deferred payment must have adequate security either by the use of an appropriate guarantee or a charge over the land.
The fair value of any land held as security is considered by management to be in excess of the carrying amount of the receivable to which it relates.
No amounts outstanding are past due.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts receivable from various housing associations and other housebuilders.
Management consider that the credit quality of the various debtors is good in respect of the amounts outstanding and therefore credit risk is considered to be low.
No material amounts are past due and there is no significant concentration risk.
A small allowance for credit losses against sundry debtors is held, however, the balance is not material in relation to the gross carrying value of this particular class of financial asset.
Loans made to joint ventures are in most cases part of the investment and carry equity like risk.
Other loans to joint ventures are made on normal arms length terms which will include security where appropriate and are usually repayable from sales proceeds.
There has been no change in the Groups exposure to credit risk or how that risk is managed from the prior year.
The merger with George Wimpey Plc did not create any new classes of financial asset with different risk proles for the Group.
The carrying amount of financial assets, as detailed above, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date assuming that any security held has no value.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ows, matching the expected cash ow timings of financial assets and liabilities and through the use of term borrowings, overdrafts and committed revolving credit facilities with a range of maturity dates to ensure continuity of funding.
Future borrowing requirements are forecast on a monthly basis and funding headroom is maintained above forecast peak requirements to meet unforeseen events.
There have been no adverse changes in the Groups exposure to liquidity risk or how it is managed from the prior year.
In addition to term borrowings and on demand overdraft facilities the Group has access to committed revolving credit facilities.
The total unused committed amount is 1,192.9m 2006: 629.5m and management believe it is adequate to meet both forecast and unforseen requirements.

Retirement benefit schemes Retirement benefit obligation comprises gross pension liability of 216.4m 2006: 205.9m and gross post-retirement health care liability of 2.7m 2006: 2.7m.
The Group operates Dened benefit and Dened Contribution pension schemes.
In the UK the Taylor Woodrow Group Pension and Life Assurance Fund TWGP&LAF, the George Wimpey Staff Pension Scheme GWSPS and the Taylor Woodrow NHS Pension Scheme TWNHSPS are funded Dened benefit schemes.
The TWGP&LAF merged with the Bryant Group Pension Scheme BGPS on 24 June 2002 and with the Wilson Connolly Holdings Pension Scheme WCHPS, the Wainhomes Ltd Pension Scheme WHLPS and the Prestoplan Pension Scheme PPS on 27 August 2004.
These schemes are managed by Boards of trustees.
With the exception of the TWNHSPS, the Dened benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
The TWGP&LAF was closed to future pension accrual with effect from 30 November 2006.
An alternative Dened Contribution arrangement, the Taylor Woodrow Personal Choice Plan, is offered to new employees and from 1 December 2006 to employees who previously accrued benets in the TWGP&LAF.
Legacy George Wimpey staff are members of a UK Stakeholder arrangement.
Contributions of 11.2m 2006: 6.7m were charged to income in respect of dened contributions schemes.
The Group also operates a number of overseas pension schemes of the dened benefit and dened contribution type.
The pension scheme assets of TWGP&LAF, GWSPS and TWNHSPS are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneciaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by each schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that at least one-third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the scheme, including at least one member by current pensioners.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the TWGP&LAF was carried out at 1 June 2004 and updated to 1 September 2004 to take account of subsequent mergers.
The TWNHSPS commenced in December 2003 and the Actuary completed his initial valuation with an effective date of 31 December 2003.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the GWSPS was carried out at 31 March 2005.
The projected unit method was used in all valuations and assets were taken into account using market values.
The next formal valuations of the TWGP&LAF, TWNHSPS and GWSPS are taking place at 1 June 2007, 31 December 2006 and 31 March 2008 respectively.
These will be undertaken in accordance with new legislation and have not yet been completed.
The statutory funding objective is that each scheme has sufficient and appropriate assets to pay its benets as they fall due.
The general principles adopted by the trustees will be that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufciently prudent for pensions and benets already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pension rights.
As part of the discussions with the Trustees of the TWGP&LAF around the closure of the scheme to future accrual, the Group has agreed to increase deficit reduction payments to 20m p. a. for 10 years.
These payments will be reviewed at each valuation.
The first such payment was made on 19 December 2006.
Following the valuation of the GWSPS as at 31 March 2005, the ordinary contribution rate increased to 15.7% of pensionable salaries.
The Group has agreed with the trustees it will aim to eliminate the deficit over the next 16 years by means of contributions of 15m per annum paid monthly.
The contribution rate to the TWNHSPS has been agreed as 18% of pensionable salaries.
The main financial assumptions, which were used for the triennial funding valuation and are all relative to the ination assumption, are as set out below: Assumptions TWGP&LAF TWNHSPS GWSPS RPI Inflation 2.5% p. a.
Discount rate pre post retirement 5.0 3.0% p. a.

The principal actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of the disclosure items are as follows: United Kingdom North America 2007 2006 2007 2006 As at 31 December Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.80% 5.10% 5.30-5.80% 5.0-5.7% Expected return on scheme assets 6.20-6.25% 5.87% 5.50-6.60% 5.5-6.6% General pay inflation 4.60% 2.75% 2.60% 3.5-4.0% Deferred pension increases 3.10% 3.00% 0% 2.5-3.5% Pension increases 2.25-3.35% 2.75% 0-3.00% 3.5-4.0% The basis for the above assumptions are prescribed by IAS 19 and do not reect the assumptions that may be used in future funding valuations of the Groups pension schemes.

The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the financial period for returns over the life of the related obligation.
The expected yield on bond investments with xed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market value.
Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government.
The risk of default on these is very small.
The trustees also hold bonds issued by public companies.
There is a more significant risk of default on these which is assessed by various rating agencies.
The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity investments.
The investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered riskier investments.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium the equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment.
There is significant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium.

The Group liability is the difference between the scheme liabilities and the scheme assets.
Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of scheme assets.
These may or may not offset the change in assumptions.
For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the scheme liability, but may also trigger an offsetting increase in the market value so there is no net effect on the company liability.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities m Discount rate Increase by 0.1% p. a.

Increase by 1.6 Rate of mortality Members assumed to live 1 year longer Increase by 45.7 The projected liabilities of the dened benefit scheme are apportioned between members past and future service using the projected unit actuarial cost method.
The dened benefit obligation makes allowance for future earnings growth.
If all active members were assumed to leave the company and the allowance for future earnings growth was replaced by an allowance for statutory revaluation, the liabilities would reduce by 22m.
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out benets at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the on-going liabilities of the scheme.
The Group estimates the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date is 1,177m in excess of the assets held by the schemes.
The gross post-retirement liability also includes 2.7m at 31 December 2007 2006: 2.7m in respect of continuing post-retirement health care insurance premiums for retired long-service employees.
The liability is based upon the actuarial assessment of the remaining cost by a qualied actuary on a net present value basis at 31 December 2007.
The cost is calculated assuming a discount rate of 5 per cent per annum and an increase in medical expenses of 10 per cent per annum.
The premium cost to the Group in respect of the retired long-service employees for 2007 was 0.2m 2006:0.2m.

It is anticipated that the majority of this provision will be utilised in 2008.
Other provisions consist of a remedial work provision and rental guarantee provision.
The remedial work provision covers various obligations, including aftercare at Springeld Environmental Limited which has a legal responsibility of a long term nature for the management of old, completed sites and provisions for losses on construction contracts for which responsibility was retained by George Wimpey Plc group following an asset swap with Tarmac Plc in 1996.

During the year Taylor Wimpey plc purchased 94.8m of its shares consistent with the announcement of the share buy back program in July 2007.

These shares are used to meet the valid exercise and or vesting of conditional awards under the DBP and PSP and options under the Savings-Related, Executive Share Option, George Wimpey LTIP and Executive Bonus Plans over shares, and the matching award of shares under the Share Purchase Plan.
During 2007, 4.3m shares were transferred out of the companys Treasury holding to the ESOTs for this purpose.

As there is a temporary difference between the accounting and tax bases, a deferred tax asset is recorded.
The deferred tax asset arising is calculated by comparing the estimated amount of tax deduction to be obtained in the future based on the companys share price at the balance sheet date with the cumulative amount of the expense recorded in the income statement.
If the amount of estimated future tax deduction exceeds the cumulative amount of the remuneration expense at the statutory tax rate, the excess is recorded directly in equity, in this share-based payment tax reserve.
A decrease for the year has been recorded as a result of the revaluation of share schemes at the end of 2007.
This has resulted in a smaller amount of tax relief obtained and expected than previously considered.
This decreases the amount of the deferred tax asset held in respect of share schemes yet to vest as indicated in note 15.
