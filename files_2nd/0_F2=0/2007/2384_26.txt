This change in accounting estimate had a direct impact on the amount of depreciation, depletion and amortization DD&A charged in the income statement in respect of oil and natural gas properties which are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis as described in Note 1.
The change in estimate was applied prospectively, with no restatement of prior periods results.
The groups actual DD&A charge for 2006 was $9,128 million, whereas the charge based on UK SORP reserves would have been $9,057 million, i. e. an increase of $71 million due to the change in reserves estimates that was used to calculate DD&A for the last three months of 2006.
For 2007, it was estimated that the DD&A charge would increase by approximately $400 million to $500 million as a result of the change.
Over the life of a field this change would have no overall effect on DD&A.
The main differences between the UK SORP and SEC rules relate to the SEC requirement to use year-end prices, the application of SEC interpretations of SEC regulations relating to the use of technology mainly seismic to estimate reserves in the reservoir away from wellbores and the reporting of fuel gas i. e. gas used for fuel in operations within proved reserves.
Consequently, reserves quantities under SEC rules differ from those that would be reported under application of the UK SORP.
The change to SEC reserves in 2006 represented a simplification of the groups reserves reporting, as only one set of reserves estimates is disclosed.
In addition, the use of SEC reserves for accounting purposes makes our results more comparable with those of our major competitors.
