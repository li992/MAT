Currency risk The US dollar is the functional currency of most operations within the Group and as a result currency exposure relates to transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar.
The Group has potential currency exposures in respect of items denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation comprising: transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues translational exposure in respect of investments in overseas operations translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items The potential currency exposures are discussed below.
Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues Operating expenditure and capital expenditure is incurred by some operations in currencies other than their functional currency.
To a lesser extent, sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations, and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation.
These risks are managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
When required under this strategy, forward exchange contracts are entered into in foreign exchange markets to hedge operating and capital costs.
The following tables provide information about the principal forward exchange hedge contracts.

There are certain operations that have Australian dollars, Canadian dollars and UK pounds sterling as their functional currency.
Foreign currency gains or losses arising on translation of the net assets of these operations are shown as a movement in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Where market conditions make it beneficial, the Group will borrow in currencies which would create translational exposure and will swap the liability into an appropriate currency.
Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items Monetary items denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are periodically restated to US dollar equivalents, and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement, with the exception of foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for restoration and rehabilitation at operating sites that are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.
The foreign currency risk is managed as part of the Portfolio Risk Management Strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
The table below shows the foreign currency risk on the monetary assets and liabilities of the Groups operations denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operations.

The Groups policy on counterparty credit exposures ensures that only counterparties of a high credit standing are used for the investment of any excess cash.
The Groups liquidity risk for derivatives arises from the possibility that a market for derivatives might not exist in some circumstances.
To counter this risk the Group only uses derivatives in highly liquid markets.

Commodity price risk is managed pursuant to the Portfolio Risk Management strategy and within the overall CFaR limit.
The following table provides information about the BHP Billiton Groups material cash settled and other commodity contracts, which have been recognised at fair value in the income statement.
Contract amounts are used to calculate the volume and average prices to be exchanged under the contracts.
26 85 36 a The notional amount represents the face value of contracts at the fixed price specified, but is not a measure of risk exposure or value.
b Floating commodity prices in future periods will be based on the benchmarks applicable at the time of the price reset.
The BHP Billiton Group also has forward commodity contracts which are designated as a cash flow hedge of future sales revenue.
The contracts are for 225,000 tonnes of copper at an average price of US$4,293 per tonne.
Contracts for 2,729 tonnes at an average price of US$5,184 per tonne have maturities of less than one year and contracts for 222,271 tonnes at an average price of US$4,282 per tonne have maturities of more than one year and less than five years.
The fair value of the contracts total US$277 million at 30 June 2007 and have been recognised in equity as an unrealised loss in the hedging reserve.
Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts or have intrinsic value at inception and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Contracts are assessed for embedded derivatives when the Group becomes a party to them, including at the date of a business combination.
Host contracts which incorporate embedded derivatives are entered into during the normal course of operations and are standard business practices in the industries in which the Group operate.
