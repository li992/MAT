Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting Policies The accounting policies which follow have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP and applicable accounting standards.
Foreign currency translation The presentation and functional currency of the Company is sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the Companys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated at cost and the cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life by equal annual instalments at rates of 7.5% for ofce equipment and 25% for computer equipment.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries and associate are held at historical cost less a provision for impairment.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the exception that deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Post-employment benets The Company and other major UK subsidiaries of the Group participate in multi-employer dened benefit pension plans which are set up under separate trusts.
These plans are operated on a basis that does not enable individual companies to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities and, in accordance with FRS17, the Company accounts for its contributions to the plans as if they are dened contribution plans.
In addition, the Company has unfunded unapproved pension promises.
Contributions are made to the plans on the advice of an independent qualied actuary.
Pension plan liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Companys unfunded unapproved pension promises expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged against operating profit.
The increase in the period in the present value of the plans liabilities, arising from the passage of time, is included in other finance income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions to dened contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account when they become payable.
Leases Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Companys executive share option scheme, the savings-related share option scheme and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Company recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equity-settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
As permitted by FRS20, the Company has applied FRS20 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity-settled awards that had not vested as at 1 January 2005 and were granted on or after 7 November 2002.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 99 Notes to the Company Financial Statements Continued 1.
Accounting Policies continued Derecognition of financial assets & liabilities The Company's principal financial assets and liabilities comprise bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits as well as financial derivatives.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of cross currency swaps is calculated by reference to market values.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the profit and loss account.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
2. profit attributable to the Company The profit dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 109.1m 2006: 18.2m.
