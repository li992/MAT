Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives During the period the Group utilised currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows.
The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts, designated as hedging instruments when the conditions specified by IAS 39 are met, based upon highly probable forecast foreign currency cash flows to minimise currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies, predominantly US Dollars.
These arrangements are designed to address exchange exposures in the year ended 31 March 2007 and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
No such derivatives were in place as at 31 March 2007.
As such the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts in place at the balance sheet date is Nil 2006: 21,479,000 and the fair value of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedging instruments is Nil 2006: liability 295,000.
Interest rate derivatives The Groups policy on interest rate risk is designed to limit the Groups exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
The borrowings as at 31 March 2007 are floating rate bank borrowings which bear interest fixed for periods between one and six months based upon LIBOR and as such are subject to cash flow interest rate risk.
Interest rate swap The Group has a five year interest rate swap which expired on 15 May 2007 for 12 million at a fixed rate of 5.62%.
Interest payable or receivable under the swap during the year is the difference between three month LIBOR and the fixed swap rate.
This amount has been included in finance charges.
At the balance sheet date the swap had no fair value 2006: liability 138,000.
The swap is not a designated hedging instrument and as such it is accounted for as at fair value through profit and loss.
Interest rate cap The Group has a five year US Dollar interest rate cap for $40m at 6.25% which expired on 15 May 2007.
At the balance sheet date the cap had no fair value.
The cap is not a designated hedging instrument and as such it is accounted for as at fair value through profit and loss.
