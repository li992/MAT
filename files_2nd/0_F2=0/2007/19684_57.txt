The defined benefit section is closed to new members.
The income statement charge was 0.4m 2006: 0.5m for the defined benefit section and 0.4m 2006: 0.3m for the defined contribution section.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 5th April 2005, when the market value of the net assets of the scheme was 26,025,000.
The valuation was performed using the Projected Unit Cost Method under IAS 19.
The main actuarial assumptions were: Investment rate of return: pre-retirement 6.3% p. a. post-retirement 4.8% p. a.
Increase in pensions 2.9% p. a. Capped to 4.9% for certain members.
The valuation showed a funding level of 95%.
The actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section, a final salary scheme, was updated to 30th November 2007 on an IAS basis by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2007 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 5.5% 5.1% 4.8% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment Pre-6th April 1997 benefits 3.0% 3.0% 2.8% Post-5th April 1997 benefits 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% Discount rate 5.8% 5.0% 4.9% Inflation assumption 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% 14704 12 02 2008 Proof13 14704STMODWEN FIN:Layout 1 13 2 08 10:05 Page 92 92 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 19 PENSIONS CONTINUED 19 The mortality rates adopted are from the PA92 year of birth and medium cohort tables which assume that, for example, male members who are currently retired are expected to draw their pensions for 24.9 years and non-retired members for 27.1 years, based on the normal retirement age of 65.
The group expects to make contributions of 0.4m to the defined benefit section of the scheme in 2008.
As the defined benefit section of the scheme is a closed scheme valued under the Projected Unit Cost Method the service cost is likely to increase in future years as members approach retirement.
The fair values of assets in the defined benefit section of the scheme and the expected rates of return were: 2007 2006 2005 % m % m % m Equities 6.1 19.4 5.8 18.0 5.7 16.7 Bonds 5.8 0.4 4.9 0.3 4.7 0.3 Property 6.1 11.7 5.8 9.8 5.7 8.4 Cash and other assets 4.6 3.5 4.3 5.8 4.2 3.9 35.0 33.9 29.3 Actuarial value of liabilities 29.0 31.1 29.8 Unrecoverable surplus 6.0 Surplus deficit in the scheme note 10 and note 12 2.8 0.5 Related deferred tax liability asset note 4 0.8 0.2 Fair value of pension asset liability net of deferred tax 2.0 0.3 Given the current uncertainty in both the equity and property markets, and with due consideration of the recently issued IFRIC guidance on the recognition of pension scheme assets, the directors do not consider it appropriate to recognise the surplus arising in the defined benefit section of the scheme at this time.
The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses before unrecoverable surplus of 6.0m recorded in the group statement of recognised income and expense is 5.0m 2006: 2.3m.
