The options awards outstanding at 24 February 2007 had a weighted average exercise price of 63 pence, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 5.3 years 2006, 4.5 years.
The fair value of management and sharesave options awards granted is calculated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.

The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The group recognised total expenses of 1.2m and 0.6m related to equity-settled share based payment transactions in 2007 and 2006 respectively.
N Brown Group plc Report and Accounts 2007 63 Notes to the Group Accounts 34 Retirement benefit schemes Defined contributions scheme The group operates defined contribution retirement benefit schemes for all qualifying employees.
The group is required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The only obligation of the group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions.
The total cost charged to income of 0.5m 2006, 0.5m represents contributions payable to the schemes by the group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
As at 24 February 2007, contributions of 0.1m 2006, 0.1m due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit schemes The group operates a defined benefit scheme, the N Brown Group Pension Fund.
Under the scheme, the employees are entitled to retirement benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries and was closed to new members from 31 January 2002.
No other post-retirement benefits are provided.
The scheme is a funded scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 30 June 2006 by an independent qualified actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in determining the groups net retirement benefit obligations at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.0 4.7 Expected return on scheme assets 5.2 5.6 Expected rate of salary increase 4.6 4.4 Pension increase rate for post 1997 pensions 3.1 2.9 Pension increase rate for pre 1997 pensions 2.0 2.0 2007 2006 Amounts recognised in income in respect of these defined benefit schemes are as follows: m m Current service cost 2.9 2.1 Interest cost 3.2 2.8 Expected return on scheme assets 1.7 1.4 Past service cost 4.4 3.5 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The actual return on scheme assets was 2.6m 2006, 4.4m.
The scheme is a closed scheme and therefore, under the projected unit method, the current service cost would be expected to increase.
