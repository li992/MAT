21 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the UK defined benefit schemes in April 2006 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
The valuation of the UK defined benefit schemes has been updated to 31 December 2007 by the Groups actuaries.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
Scheme assets for the purpose of IAS 19 are stated at their bid value.
The amounts included in the financial statements in respect of the Group are as follows: 2007 2006 Amounts included in net operating expenses m m Defined contribution schemes 6.3 6.2 Defined benefit schemes current service cost 5.0 5.2 past service cost credit 0.1 3.3 Total operating charge 11.4 8.1 Amounts included in finance income cost Expected return on scheme assets 14.2 11.6 Interest charge on scheme liabilities 12.6 12.0 Net financial return charge 1.6 0.4 Total charge 9.8 8.5 Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 33 21 Pensions continued 2007 2006 Amounts recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 0.6 7.3 Experience gain on scheme liabilities 0.4 7.5 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 10.5 2.6 Actuarial gain recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 10.3 17.4 The cumulative amount of actuarial losses arising since 1 January 2004 recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense at 31 December 2007 was 12.9m 2006: 23.2m.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of IAS 19 were: Europe 2007 2006 Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years 21.0 20.1 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years 22.2 21.3 US Longevity at age 65 for current and future pensioners years 19.3 18.9 Europe US 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 4.15% 4.0% 3.75% 4.0% 4.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 3.15% 3.0% 2.75% Discount rate 5.75% 5.2% 4.8% 6.0% 6.0% 5.75% Inflation rate 3.15% 3.0% 2.75% 3.0% 3.0% 2.5% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The market value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before being realised, and the present value of pension obligations, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are therefore inherently uncertain, are: Europe US Total 2007 2007 2007 Long term Value Long term Value Value rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 8.0% 122.0 9.75% 29.0 151.0 Bonds 5.0% 60.4 6.0% 17.7 78.1 Other 4.4% 0.7 4.5% 0.1 0.8 Blended rate of return on scheme assets 7.0% 8.7% Total market value of scheme assets 183.1 46.8 229.9 Present value of funded obligations 179.0 54.4 233.4 Present value of unfunded obligations 3.2 6.8 10.0 Present value of funded and unfunded obligations 182.2 61.2 243.4 Unrecognised past service cost 0.3 0.3 Surplus deficit 0.9 14.1 13.2 Deferred tax 4.9 4.9 Net surplus deficit 0.9 9.2 8.3 Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 1.0 1.6 0.6 Experience adjustments arising on scheme liabilities 0.2 0.2 0.4 Long term rate of return is based on the weighted average across all European defined benefit pension schemes.
