In particular, the Groups subsidiary Vodafone 2 is responding to an enquiry by HM Revenue & Customs HMRC with regard to the UK tax treatment of one of its Luxembourg holding companies under the controlled foreign companies CFC rules.
Further details in relation to this enquiry are included in note 31 Contingent liabilities.
At 31 March 2007, the Group holds provisions of 1,718 million tax and 400 million interest in respect of the potential UK tax liability that may arise from this enquiry 2006: 1,822 million tax and 276 million interest.
In September 2006, ruling in the case of Cadbury Schweppes, the European Court of Justice provided guidance as to the allowable application of the UK CFC rules.
Considering the facts of the Vodafone 2 case and the ECJ ruling in Cadbury Schweppes, management considers these amounts are sufficient to settle any assessments that may result from the enquiry.
However, the amount ultimately paid may differ materially from the amount accrued and could therefore affect the overall profitability and cash flows of the Group in future periods.
