NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the year and with the proceeding year, are set out below.
a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP and the AICs Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in December 2005. b Investments The Companys investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as the Companys business is to invest in financial assets with a view to proting from their total return in the form of capital growth and income.
Quoted investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Where trading in the securities of an investee company is suspended, the investment is valued at the Boards estimate of its net realisable value.
As investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the capital return for the period and transaction costs on acquisition or disposal of a security are expensed to the Capital Reserve-realised.
Purchases and sales of investments are accounted for on trade date.
c Income Dividends receivable on quoted equity shares are brought into account on the ex-dividend date.
Dividend income is shown excluding any related tax credit.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Other income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged to revenue except as follows:.
expenses which are incidental to the acquisition and disposal of an investment are charged to capital: and.
expenses are charged to capital reserve-realised where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 62.5% to capital reserve-realised and 37.5% to revenue reserve, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the nancing of the Companys investments or to nancing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 62.5% to capital reserve-realised and 37.5% to revenue account, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of capital gains and income respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
The following are accounted for in this reserve:.
gains and losses on the realisation of investments:.
gains on the return of capital by way of investee companies paying special dividends: and.
expenses, together with the related taxation effect, charged to this reserve in accordance with the above policies.
increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year-end.
40 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Special reserve This reserve may be treated as distributable profits for all purposes, excluding the payment of dividends.
h Taxation The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between revenue and capital on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates, under the marginal method, using the Companys effective rate of tax for the accounting period.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date measured on an undiscounted basis and based on enacted tax rates.
This is subject to deferred tax assets being recognised only if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.

Overdrafts are utilised when the Managers believe it is in the interest of the Company to nancially gear the portfolio.
Note 1 sets out the accounting policies, including criteria for recognition and the basis of measurement applied for significant financial instruments excluding cash at bank which is carried at fair value.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i cash ow interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash ows of a financial instrument will uctuate because of changes in market interest rates: and ii market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will uctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movement.
Since the Company invests in UK equities traded on the London Stock Exchange, credit risk and liquidity risk are not significant.
Short term funding exibility can be achieved through the use of the bank debt facility.
Fair value risk is covered under market price risk.
The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in sterling, therefore, currency risk arising from exchange rate uctuations have no direct effect on profit or loss, or Shareholders funds.
47 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 17 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued i Cash ow interest rate risk The Company has a bank debt facility of 80,000,000 of which nil was utilised at 31 December 2007 2006: total facilities 80,000,000 of which nil were utilised as at 31 December 2006.
The interest rate on amounts utilised is variable at 0.6% 2006: 0.6% over base rate with no arrangement or non-utilisation fees payable.
The debt may be repaid by the Company at any time without penalty but the lender cannot withdraw the facilities without providing at least 364 days notice at all times.
When the Company decides to hold cash balances, all balances are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest linked to bank base rate which at 31 December 2007 was 5.5% 2006: 5.0%.
The Companys policy is to hold cash in variable rate bank accounts and not usually to invest in xed rate securities.
The Companys investment portfolio is not directly exposed to interest rate risk.
If the bank base rate had increased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a positive 90,000 2006: 153,000.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss would have been a negative 90,000 2006: negative 153,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
ii Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price uctuations which are monitored by the investment managers in pursuance of the investment objective.
No derivative or hedging instruments are currently utilised to specically manage market price risk.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Managers Report on pages 9 to 14, which is not subject to audit.
It is not the Managers policy to use derivatives to manage portfolio risk.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 10% at 31 December 2007, the impact on the profit or loss would have been negative 71.0m 2006: negative 80.1m.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 10% at 31 December 2007, the impact on the profit or loss would have been positive 71.0m 2006: 80.1m.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments, all of which are included in the balance sheet at fair value, at 31 December 2007: Classication of financial instruments 2007 2006 Book Value Fair Value Book Value Fair Value 000 000 000 000 Assets at fair value through profit or loss Investment portfolio 710,966 710,966 801,470 801,470 Cash at bank 18,018 18,018 30,554 30,554 Loans and Receivables Investment income receivable 1,617 1,617 1,304 1,304 Other debtors 4,737 4,737 65 65 Other creditors 317 317 62 62 735,021 735,021 833,331 833,331 The investment portfolio consists of listed investments valued at their bid price, which represents fair value.
