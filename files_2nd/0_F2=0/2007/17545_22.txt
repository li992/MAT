IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRS 8, Operating segments, was published on 30 November 2006 and is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
As with other new standards, early adoption is permitted.
The standard requires disclosure of segment information that management uses internally to evaluate segment results.
Before IFRS 8 can be applied in the UK it has to be endorsed by the EU: the endorsement process typically takes about six months and therefore we plan to apply IFRS 8 for periods beginning 1 April 2007.
We do not believe that implementation of this standard will affect our consolidated results or cash flows.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 8 clarifies that transactions within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based payments include those in which the entity cannot specifically identify some or all of the goods or services received.
If the identifiable consideration given appears to be less than the fair value of the equity instruments granted or liability incurred, this situation typically indicates that other consideration has been or will be received.
We do not believe that implementation of IFRIC 8 will have a significant effect on our consolidated results or cash flows.

Management reporting For the purposes of exercising day-to-day managerial and budgetary control, the UK income statement is divided internally by product but these divisions are neither self-standing businesses nor cash generating units.
For the purpose of managing the UK business, most common costs are allocated entirely to classified directories.
Control is exercised by comparing performance against budgets that are agreed in advance.
The Chief Executive Officer reviews the revenue, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before and after exceptional items within geographic segments.
EBITDA, before exceptional items, together with revenue and cash conversion, are the key financial measures that we use to assess the success of our business in achieving growth and operational efficiencies.
He also reviews the Groups adjusted operating cash flow as a percentage of adjusted EBITDA Cash Conversion and free cash flow to assess our efficiency in converting profit into cash.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups Long-term Incentive Plan.
At 31 March 2006, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
There has been no impairment of goodwill in 2006 or 2007.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the long-term growth rates stated below.
The carrying value of goodwill and the key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations were as follows: Chile Peru Argentina Spain US UK m m m m m m Net book value Carrying value of goodwill 160.8 37.6 54.4 1,054.9 1,331.4 1,006.2 Long-term growth rate 4.1% 3.5% 3.4% 2.8% 2.6% 2.8% Discount rate 11.5% 12.0% 17.5% 8.5% 8.0% 8.0% The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in the long-term growth rates and discount rates.
The long-term growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts of national growth rates included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are after tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.

The treasury function is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The Board sets the treasury functions policy and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the investments and borrowings under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed within controls set by the Board.
Derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are normally used only for hedging purposes.
The principal financing and treasury exposures faced by the Group arise from working capital management, the financing of acquisitions and property, plant and equipment, the management of interest rates on the Groups debt and the investment of surplus cash.
The treasury function manages those exposures with the objective of remaining within ratios covenanted with the lenders of its bank debt.
The Group has not purchased or issued any derivative contracts for trading or hedging purposes, except as referred to below.
The Yell Group has funded the business largely from cash flows generated from operations and bank debt.
Details of the Groups borrowings are disclosed in note 17.
All significant cash inflows and outflows associated with the Groups operations in the UK are denominated in pounds sterling, and all significant cash inflows and outflows associated with operations in the US are denominated in dollars.
All significant cash inflows and outflows associated with the Groups operations in Spain are denominated in euros.
Cash inflow and outflows associated with the Groups operations in Latin America are denominated in local currency.
However, the financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, and changes in the exchange rate between the dollar, the euro and pounds sterling will affect the translation of the results of our operations in the US, Spain and Latin America into pounds sterling.
The composition of our debt partially hedges exchange rate fluctuations, because 41.1% of our debt and 47.5% of our net interest expense are denominated in US dollars, thereby reducing our US EBITDA exposure by approximately 36.0%.
Additionally, 22.0% of our debt and 15.6% of our net interest expense are denominated in euros, thereby reducing our euro EBITDA exposure by approximately 24.8%.
The Group does not intend to hedge the remaining foreign exchange translation exposure, although we will continue to review this practice.
The Group now borrows only at variable rates of interest on its term bank debt and, in order to achieve the objective of managing interest rate risk, partially hedges its risks through the use of interest-rate derivative instruments.
We have fixed interest on at least 90% of the indebtedness under the term bank facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to June 2009 and around 50% thereafter until March 2011, with a review of this strategy on a quarterly basis.
During the year ended 31 March 2007, net debt increased from 1,994.0 million to 3,662.2 million, primarily as a result of refinancing on the acquisition of Yell Publicidad.
Other financial instruments The Group also has short-term receivables and payables that arise in the normal course of business and, therefore, have been excluded from the disclosures which follow.
There has been no change in the role that financial instruments have in creating or changing the Groups risk between 31 March 2007 and the date of these financial statements.

There are no material monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling, US dollars or euros.
Interest rate profile Details of year-end interest rates on borrowings are set out in note 17.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future floating interest rate movements on its term bank debt.
The Group has fixed interest rates on at least 90% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to June 2009 and around 50% thereafter to March 2011.

The Group expects to continue to fix its floating rate financial liabilities at the end of each month by reference to one month LIBOR at that time.
Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk The Group has maintained committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face.
There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2007 of 400 million 2006 600 million of which 97.2 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2007 2006 242.2 million.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table reflects the carrying amount and fair value of the Groups financial instruments at 31 March 2006 and 2007.

The largest acquisition was that of 94.25% of the share capital of Telefnica Publicidad e Informacin, S. A. TPI for 2,939.8 million 2,010.3 million.
The purchase price of TPI was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities as follows: Acquirees carrying Fair value amount adjustments Fair value m m m Non-current assets Other intangible assets 109.4 1,028.7 1,138.1 Property, plant and equipment 24.7 14.8 39.5 Deferred tax assets 30.8 30.8 Total non-current assets 164.9 1,043.5 1,208.4 Current assets Directories in development 48.0 34.9 82.9 Trade and other receivables 292.2 292.2 Cash and cash equivalents 16.8 16.8 Total current assets 357.0 34.9 391.9 Current liabilities Loans and other borrowings 90.0 90.0 Corporation tax 12.8 12.8 Trade and other payables 251.9 251.9 Total current liabilities 354.7 354.7 Total assets less current liabilities 167.2 1,078.4 1,245.6 Non-current liabilities Loans and other borrowings 70.2 70.2 Deferred tax liabilities 29.1 403.7 432.8 Trade and other payables 6.4 6.4 Identifiable net assets 61.5 674.7 736.2 Minority interests 42.3 Share of net assets acquired 693.9 Goodwill 1,316.4 Total cost 2,010.3 Non-current intangible assets totalling 1,664.4 million 1,138.1 million comprise 1,130.7 million 773.2 million of brand names, 408.4 million 279.3 million of customer lists, and 125.3 million 85.6 million allocated between software, contracts, and non-compete agreements.
Directories in development comprise all current intangible assets, including customer commitments and a customer database.
Goodwill of 1,925.0 million 1,316.4 million is attributable to the future synergies expected, the workforce acquired and future growth of the business.
The acquisition of TPI now renamed Yell Publicidad was financed by debt acquired of 1,634.0 million, proceeds from the share placement of 344.8 million, and operating cash of 31.5 million.
The consolidated financial information of the Yell Group consolidates the financial results of Yell Publicidad for the eight months ended 31 March 2007.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 April 2006, we estimate that the pro forma Group revenue to 31 March 2007 would have been 2,206.8 million and Group adjusted EBITDA would have been 708.7 million.
On 28 March 2007, we purchased a further 16,136,315 shares of Yell Publicidad for 137.5 93.6 million, representing a further 4.47% of the share capital, resulting in ownership of 98.72% of the issued share capital.
On 2 April 2007, Yell Publicidad formally delisted its remaining outstanding shares.
This purchase was accounted for using the economic entity method whereby any excess of consideration over the Groups share of net assets is an adjustment to equity rather than goodwill.

Goodwill of 681.2 million is attributable to expected future synergies, the workforce acquired and future growth of the business.
The results of TransWestern reduced the Group profit before tax by 19.1 million in the period from the date of acquisition to 31 March 2006.
In the same period, the results of TransWestern increased the Group profit before tax, amortisation and exceptional costs by 12.5 million loss of 19.1 million with 27.2 million and 4.4 million added back for amortisation and exceptional costs, respectively.

The YPP assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, property, fixed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees set asset allocation targets at 31 March 2006 in which approximately 55% of the assets held should be equity investments and 45% should be debt securities.
The trustees changed their asset allocation approach during the year to 31 March 2007, splitting the portfolio into pre-horizon and posthorizon categories.
The pre-horizon assets are all debt securities and at 31 March 2007 comprised around 17% of the total assets.
The post-horizon assets have allocation targets of 60% equities, 10% property and 30% index-linked debt securities.

Contributions of 16.0 million, plus 2.1 million in respect of benefit augmentations were made in the year.
In the year ended 31 March 2006 until 31 December 2005, the Group made contributions at an average rate of 13.05% of pensionable earnings inclusive of expenses and life assurance premiums, but exclusive of the Pension Protection Fund levy.
From 1 January 2006, the Group made contributions at an average rate of 23.6%.
The Groups trustees have agreed that contributions for the next year will continue at the 23.6% rate, with an evaluation of future contribution rates after the next full valuation.
Contributions for the next financial year are expected to be around 17 million.
Additionally, SMART Pensions were introduced with effect from 1 March 2005, under which Plan participants may accept a reduction in their salary in return for non-contributory membership of the Plan, the reduction being equal to the contributions otherwise payable.
The Group makes additional contributions of a corresponding amount.
In the year ended 31 March 2007 these amounted to 2.9 million 5.25% of pensionable earnings.
The 16.1 million actuarial gain reflects a 15.9 million reduction in liabilities, plus 0.2 million actuarial gains in asset values.
The increase in liabilities in the year ended 31 March 2006 was primarily the result of declining real interest rates the reference market rate to which the discount rate is tied, net of expected inflation interest in the market price of certain government debt during the year.
The actuarial loss in the year ended 31 March 2006 was primarily the result of declining real interest rates during the year offset by actuarial gains in asset values.
As the scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost per employee member will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

Defined contribution schemes In addition to the defined contribution Section Four of the YPP, Yellow Book sponsors a 401 k plan for the majority of Yellow Book employees in the US.
The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines.
Yellow Book matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellow Book in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to 4.1 million in the year ended 31 March 2007 2006 3.4 million for the Yellow Book scheme, and 1.3 million 2006 0.9 million for Section Four of the YPP.
