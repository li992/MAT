Like many other employers, the Group has also increased the amount of the lump sum payment for the pension commuted.
Updating the commutation arrangements to reect these factors increases the post-retirement liability by 100m.
The Group has also agreed a 2 per cent discretionary increase applicable to pensions that do not benefit from any guaranteed increase, which increases the liability by 30m.
The reconciliation of underlying earnings per ordinary share is provided in note 6.

Values in use have been estimated using cash ows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management.
Given the long-term nature of the business in which the Group operates, these typically forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates that reect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions on which the cash ow projections for the most recent forecast are based are discount rates, growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
The pre-tax cash ow projections have been discounted at 12.75 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.

3 Fair values are assumed to approximate to cost either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of the investments is reset after periods not exceeding six months.
4 Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not readily available principally in respect of derivatives, borrowings and financial RRSPs, fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cash ows using prevailing interest rate curves.
Amounts denominated in foreign currencies are valued at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.

The Group uses commodity swaps to manage its exposure to movements in the price of commodities jet fuel and base metals.
From January 1, 2005, the Group has not included foreign exchange or commodity financial instruments in any cash ow hedging relationships for accounting purposes.
To hedge the currency risk associated with a borrowing denominated in US dollars, the Group has currency derivatives designated as part of fair value hedges.

Risk management policies and hedging activities The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange rate risk: interest rate risk: and commodity price risk.
The Board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Group has significant cash ows most signicantly US dollars, followed by the Euro denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant trading entity.
To manage its exposures to changes in values of future foreign currency cash ows, so as to maintain relatively stable long-term foreign exchange rates on settled transactions, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign currency transactions.
For accounting purposes, these derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.
The Group also has exposures to the fair values of non-derivative financial instruments denominated in foreign currencies.
To manage the risk of changes in these fair values, the Group enters into derivative forward foreign exchange contracts, which are designated as fair value hedges for accounting purposes.
The Group regards its interests in overseas subsidiary companies as long-term investments.
The Group aims to match its translational exposures by matching the currencies of assets and liabilities.
Where appropriate, foreign currency financial liabilities may be designated as hedges of the net investment.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its xed rate borrowings fair value risk and oating rate borrowings cash ow risk.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage the overall interest rate prole within the Group policy, which is to maintain a higher proportion of net debt at xed rates of interest having regard to the prevailing interest rate outlook.
These are designated as either fair value or cash ow hedges as appropriate.
Commodity risk The Group has exposures to the price of jet fuel and base metals arising from business operations.
To minimise its cash ow exposures to changes in commodity prices, the Group enters into derivative commodity transactions.
Other price risk The Groups cash equivalent balances represent investments in money market instruments, with a term of up to one month.
The Group does not consider that these are subject to significant price risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to hold financial investments and maintain undrawn committed facilities at a level sufficient to ensure that the Group has available funds to meet its medium-term capital and funding obligations and to meet any unforeseen obligations and opportunities.
The Group holds cash and short-term investments, which together with the undrawn committed facilities, enable the Group to manage its liquidity risk.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Group has credit policies covering both trading and financial exposures.
At the balance sheet date, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments.

The most significant transactional currency exposures are US dollar with sterling and US dollar with euro.
At December 31, 2007 if sterling had weakened five per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 157m lower 2006 166m.
If sterling had strengthened five per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 142m higher 2006 150m.
There would have been no change to the underlying results that exclude unrealised gains and losses on foreign exchange derivatives.
At December 31, 2007 if the euro had weakened five per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax and equity for the year would have been 35m lower 2006 18m.
If the euro had strengthened five per cent against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, profit after tax for the year and equity would have been 32m higher 2006 16m.

B Shares and payments to shareholders Since July 2004, the Company has issued non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference shares B Shares as an alternative to paying a cash dividend.
B Shares in respect of a year are issued in the following year.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their B Shares for cash or convert them into ordinary shares.
Any B Shares retained attract a dividend of 75 per cent of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a twice-yearly basis, and have limited voting rights.
In certain circumstances the Company has the option to compulsorily redeem the B Shares, at any time, if the aggregate number of B Shares in issue is less than ten per cent of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of B Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on the B Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have been accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.

significant delays occur in the notication and settlement of claims and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost and timing of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The insurance provisions are based on information currently available, however it is inherent in the nature of the business that ultimate liabilities may vary.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected liability as well as claims incurred but not yet reported.
Other provisions comprise a number of liabilities with varying expected utilisation rates.
Customer nancing provisions cover guarantees provided for asset value and or nancing.
These guarantees are considered to be insurance contracts in nature and provision is made in accordance with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
These guarantees, the risks arising and the process used to assess the extent of the risk are described under the headingSales nancingin the Finance Directors review on page 45.
The related contingent liabilities arising from these guarantees and the sensitivity to movements in the value of the underlying security are discussed in note 23.

For the UK dened benefit schemes, the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and employees are entitled to retirement benets based on their final salaries and length of service.
Overseas dened benefit schemes are a mixture of funded and unfunded plans.
Additionally in the US, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benets for retired employees.
The valuations of the dened benefit schemes are based on the most recent funding valuations, updated by the scheme actuaries to December 31, 2007.
The most recent funding valuations of the main UK schemes were: Scheme Valuation date Rolls-Royce Pension Fund March 31, 2006 1 Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme April 5, 2007 1 Vickers Group Pension Scheme March 31, 2007 1 Preliminary As described in the Finance Directors review on page 42, during 2007, the trustees of the UK dened benefit schemes, in consultation with the Group, have undertaken a review of their investment strategies.
As a result, revised investment strategies have been adopted that aim to hedge, on an economic basis, the majority of the interest rate and ination risks associated with pension liabilities by investing a significant proportion of each schemesassets in swap contracts, backed by short-term money market deposits the liability-driven investment or LDI portfolio.
Following the agreement of this revised strategy, new entrants are no longer able to join the schemes and the Group has paid additional contributions of 500m to the main UK pensions schemes.
As described in note 1, for accounting purposes, the defined benefit schemes are valued in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
In particular, IAS 19 requires the discount rate used for the valuation of forecast liabilities to be determined by reference to the market yield on high quality corporate bonds.
In contrast, for funding purposes, the discount rate is determined by reference to the expected rate of return on the scheme's assets, taking account of the specific investment strategy in place.
As a result of this difference in valuation methodologies, the amounts recognised in the balance sheet will differ from those that would have been recognised if the valuation had been undertaken using the assumptions used for funding purposes.
Accordingly, although the investment strategy aims to hedge interest rate and inflation risk on an economic basis, the net position recognised in the balance sheet for UK defined benefit schemes may vary over time as a result of actuarial gains and losses that arise due to this difference in valuation methodologies.

This a salary sacrifice scheme under which employees elect to stop making employee contributions and the Group makes additional contributions in return for a reduction in gross contractual pay.
As a result, there has been a decrease in wages and salaries and a corresponding increase in pension costs of 3m in the year.
Dened benefit schemes Assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2007 2006 UK Overseas UK Overseas schemes schemes schemes schemes % % %% Rate of increase in salaries 5.0 3.8 4.4 3.6 1 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.5 0.4 2.9 0.3 Discount rate 5.8 6.0 5.1 5.6 Expected rate of return on scheme assets 5.4 7.5 6.6 7.0 Ination assumption 3.5 2.5 2.9 2.4 1 Benets accruing after April 5, 2005 are assumed to increase in payment at a rate of 2.4 per cent.
The discount rates are determined by reference to the market yields on AA rated corporate bonds.
For the main UK schemes, the rate is determined by using the prole of forecast benefit payments to derive a weighted average discount rate from the yield curve.
For less significant UK schemes and overseas schemes, the rate is determined as the market yield at the average duration of the forecast benefit payments.
The discount rates above are the weighted average of those for each scheme, based on the value of their respective liabilities.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual returns expected from each asset class see below in accordance with the actual asset balance in the schemesinvestment portfolios.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the UK pension schemes are derived from the PA92 actuarial tables, with medium cohort, published by the Institute of Actuaries, projected forward and, where appropriate, adjusted to take account of the relevant schemes actual experience.
The resulting range of life expectancies in the principal UK schemes are as follows: Life expectancy from age 65 Current pensioner 17.5 years to 22.2 years Future pensioner 19.5 years to 23.9 years Other demographic assumptions have been set on advice from the relevant actuary, having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the schemes.
Assumptions in respect of overseas schemes are also set in accordance with advice from local actuaries.
The future costs of healthcare benets are based on an assumed healthcare costs trend rate of nine per cent grading down to five per cent over seven years.

Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
Surpluses have arisen on the UK schemes in 2007, largely as a result of differences between the actuarial and IAS 19 valuation assumptions.
3 Comparatives have been restated to show the split between post-retirement scheme surpluses and deficits.

The expected rate of return for LDI portfolios is determined by the implicit yield on the portfolio at the balance sheet date.
The expected rates of return on other individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to gilt yields.
In the UK, equities and corporate bonds are assumed to generate returns that exceed the return from gilts by 3.25 per cent and 0.8 per cent per annum respectively.
The expected rates of return above are the weighted average of the rates for each scheme.
Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2007 Overview 103 Governance Financial statements 18 Post-retirement benets continued Future contributions The Group expects to contribute approximately 271m to its dened benefit schemes in 2008.
Sensitivities As described above, the revised investment strategies are designed to hedge the risks from interest rates and ination.
The principle remaining risks relate to the assumptions for mortality and increases in salaries.
If the age ratings in respect of the principal UK dened benefit schemes were increased by one year, the scheme liabilities would increase by 164m.
If the rate of increase in salaries were 0.5 per cent higher, scheme liabilities would increase by 112m.
The dened benefit obligation relating to post-retirement medical benets would increase by 33m if the healthcare trend rate increases by one per cent, and reduce by 27m if it decreases by one per cent.
The pension expense relating to post-retirement medical benefits, comprising service cost and interest cost, would increase by 4m if the healthcare trend increases by one per cent, and reduce by 3m if it decreases by one per cent.

21 Share-based payments Share-based payment plans in operation during the year The Group had the following share-based payment plans in operation during the year: Performance Share Plan PSP This plan involves the award of shares to participants subject to performance conditions.
Vesting of the performance shares is based on the achievement of both non-market based conditions EPS and cash ow per share and a market based performance condition Total Shareholder Return TSR.
ShareSave share option plan Based on a three or five year monthly savings contract, eligible employees are granted share options with an exercise price of up to 20 per cent below the share price when the contract is entered into.
Vesting of the options is not subject to the achievement of a performance target.
In the UK, the plan is HM Revenue & Customs approved.
Overseas, employees in 32 countries participate in ShareSave plans through arrangements broadly comparable to the UK plan.
A small proportion of the ShareSave options are settled in cash.
Executive Share Option Plan ESOP This plan involves the grant of market value share options to participants.
The options are subject to a non-market based performance condition growth in EPS.
The options have a maximum contractual life of ten years.
Following the introduction of the PSP, it is not intended to grant any further executive share options.
Annual Performance Related Award APRA plan deferred shares Deferred shares are awarded as part of the APRA plan.
One third of the value of any annual bonus is delivered in the form of a deferred share award.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain an employee of the Group for two years from the date of the award in order to retain the full number of shares.
During the two year deferral period, participants are entitled to receive dividends on the deferred shares.

Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2007 Overview 106 Governance Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Share-based payments continued Fair values The weighted average fair values per share for PSP awards, ShareSave grants, APRA deferred share awards, and SIP Free Share awards included in the expense for the year were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 2004 2003 Pence Pence Pence Pence Pence PSP awards 557p 494p 282p 249p ShareSave 3 year grants 230p 131p 61p ShareSave 5 year grants 264p 154p 71p ESOP 22.7p APRA deferred share awards 502p 448p 260p 220p SIP Free Share awards 499p 462p 257p 231p Details of the assumptions used in the calculation of these fair values are set out below.
Expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the seven years prior to the grant or award date.
Expected dividends were based on the Companys payments to shareholders over the five years prior to the grant or award date.
PSP awards The fair value of shares awarded under the PSP are calculated using the market value of shares at the time of the award adjusted to take into account non-entitlement to dividends or equivalent during the vesting period and the TSR performance condition.
The PSP fair values were calculated using the following assumptions: 2007 2006 2005 2004 Weighted average share price 501p 444p 262p 233p Expected dividends 8.30p 7.92p 7.81p 7.61p Volatility 29% 32% 34% 35% Correlation 26% 19% 19% 22% Expected life 3 years 3 years 3 years 3 years Risk free interest rate 5.2% 4.3% 4.9% 5.2% As explained on page 56 of the  report, the PSP has a TSR market-based performance condition, such that the Companys TSR over the performance period will be compared with the TSR of the companies constituting the FTSE 100 index on the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR exceeds the median TSR of the FTSE 100, the number of shares that vest will be increased by 25 per cent.
The fair value of an award of shares under the PSP has been adjusted to take into account this market-based performance condition using a pricing model based on expectations about volatility and the correlation of share price returns in the group of FTSE 100 companies and which incorporates into the valuation the interdependency between share price performance and TSR vesting.
This adjustment increases the fair value relative to the share price at the date of grant.
ShareSave awards The fair value of options granted under the ShareSave plan are calculated using a binomial pricing model with the following assumptions: 2007 2005 2003 Weighted average share price 553p 351p 173p Exercise price 416p 298p 142p Volatility 37% 40% 43% Expected dividends 8.80p 7.86p 7.61p 1 Expected life 3 year ShareSave 3.3-3.8 years 3.3-3.8 years 3.2-3.7 years 5 year ShareSave 5.3-5.8 years 5.3-5.8 years 5.2-5.7 years Close periods: From January 1 6 weeks 6 weeks 6 weeks From July 1 1 month 1 month 1 month Risk free interest rate 5.0% 4.4% 4.6% 1 The binomial pricing model assumes that participants will exercise their options at the beginning of the six month window if the share price is greater than the exercise price.
Otherwise it assumes that options are held until the expiration of their contractual term.
This results in an expected life that falls somewhere between the start and end of the exercise window.

23 Contingent liabilities In connection with the sale of its products the Group will, on some occasions, provide nancing support for its customers.
The Groups contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements are spread over many years and relate to a number of customers and a broad product portfolio.
Contingent liabilities are disclosed on a discounted basis.
As the directors consider the likelihood of these contingent liabilities crystallising to be remote, this amount does not represent a present value.
However, the amounts are discounted at the Groups borrowing rate to reect better the time span over which these exposures could arise.
The contingent liabilities are denominated in US dollars.
As the Group does not adopt cash flow hedge accounting for forecast foreign exchange transactions, this amount is reported, together with the sterling equivalent at the reporting date spot rate.
The discounted value of the total gross contingent liabilities relating to delivered aircraft and other arrangements where financing is in place, less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions, at December 31, 2007 amounted to $1,227m, 616m 2006 $1,109m, 566m.
Taking into account the net realisable value of the relevant security including unrestricted cash collateral of $120m, 60m 2006 $114m, 58m, the discounted value of the net contingent liabilities amounted to $279m, 140m 2006 $243m, 124m.
Sensitivity calculations are complex, but for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20 per cent, a net contingent liability with a discounted value of approximately $434m, 218m 2006 $361m, 184m would result.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft, but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future, and the relevant nancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Group has, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group.
