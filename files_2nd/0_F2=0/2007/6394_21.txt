NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF ACCOUNTING These financial statements are prepared on the going concern basis, under the historical cost convention except for the valuation of share based payments, and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the UK.
The principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, except for any changes arising from the adoption of new accounting standards, are set out below.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash ow statement on the grounds that its consolidated financial statements, which include the Company and present a cash ow statement, are publicly available.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 8, the Company is exempt from the requirement to disclose related party transactions with entities that are part of the Galliford Try plc Group.
RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS FRS 29, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures were issued in August 2005 and effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007.
These disclosures revise and enhance previous disclosures required by FRS 25, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and FRS 13, Derivatives and financial instruments: Disclosures.
The adoption of FRS 29 will have no impact upon the results and net assets of the Company.
MONEY MARKET DEPOSITS Money market deposits are stated at cost.
All income from these investments is included in the profit and loss account as interest receivable and similar income.
INTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recorded at the value of the amount received, net of attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
FIXED ASSET INVESTMENTS AND IMPAIRMENT The book value of xed asset investments would be written down to estimated recoverable amount should any impairment in the respective carrying values be identied.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Companys interest rate exposure.
The interest payable or receivable in respect of these swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at the year end with the movement being recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN Own shares held by the Galliford Try Employee Share Trust The Trust are shown, at cost less any permanent diminution in value, as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve.
The charge made to the profit and loss account for employee share awards and options is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant spread over the performance period.
SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees.
The equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Companys estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The credits associated with the the amounts charged to the profit and loss account are included in retained earnings until the awards are exercised.
DEFERRED TAX Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
