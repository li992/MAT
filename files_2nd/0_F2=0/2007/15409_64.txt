Notes to the consolidated financial statements 30 Retirement benefit obligations a Plan information The Group maintains pension plans for its operations throughout the world.
Most of these arrangements are defined benefit pension schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits.
The retirement income benefits are generally a function of years of employment and final salary.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The schemes are funded in line with local practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice.
The schemes operated by the Group are subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the relevant country.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out as at 31 March 2007 by independent actuaries.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes and multi-employer pension arrangements.
On 1 April 2002, the main United Kingdom scheme was closed to new members.
A defined contribution pension scheme has been established to provide pension benefits to new United Kingdom employees.
Under the projected unit method, the service cost of the closed scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
The Groups subsidiaries in the United States provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
The Group expects to contribute approximately 40 million to its defined benefit plans in the year to 31 March 2008. b Principal assumptions The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows: Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2007 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 3.0% 3.5% 2.0-2.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.8% 4.5% 2.0-4.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 3.0% 0.0% 0.0-1.8% n a Discount rate 5.4% 5.8% 4.9-5.2% 5.8% Expected return on plan assets total 5.7% 7.8% 4.4-6.8% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 7.8% 8.8% 5.8-8.0% n a Pension benefits Medical Year to 31 March 2006 UK US Others benefits Inflation rate 2.8% 3.5% 2.0-2.5% 3.5% Expected rate of salary increases 4.6% 4.5% 2.0-4.0% n a Expected rate of pension increases 2.8% 0.0% 0.0-1.8% n a Discount rate 4.9% 6.0% 4.6-5.3% 6.0% Expected return on plan assets total 6.2% 7.8% 4.5-7.0% n a Expected equity return on plan assets 7.7% 8.8% 5.8-8.4% n a Expected longevity post age 60 Mortality assumptions UK Group scheme US Plans Male aged 60 now 24 years 22 years Male aged 60 in 15 years time 25 years 22 years Female aged 60 now 25 years 24 years Female aged 60 in 15 years time 26 years 24 years Shorter longevity assumptions are used for members who retire on grounds of ill-health.
