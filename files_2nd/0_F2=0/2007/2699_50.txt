Fair value adjustments have been finalised in the 2007 accounts.
The goodwill recognised on all other acquisitions represents the increased profitability arising from the enhanced route-to-market, enhanced market share in the South African gum market and a greater share of those businesses in which we already had an interest.
Discontinued operations There are no discontinued operations in 2007.
In 2005, our beverages business in Europe was classified as discontinued and the disposal completed in 2006.
In 2006, we announced and completed the disposal of our South Africa beverages business.
As this disposal was part of our strategic decision to exit beverages outside the Americas and Australia, it was also classified as discontinued operations.
As required by IFRS 5 the following income statement and associated notes for 2006 are presented for the discontinued operations.
a The results of the discontinued operations which have been included in the consolidated income statement are as follows: 2006 m Revenue 70 Trading costs 67 Profit from operations 3 Profit before financing and taxation 3 Finance costs 5 Loss before taxation 2 Taxation 4 Profit on disposal 631 Tax on profit on disposal 42 Release of disposal tax provisions 51 Net profit attributable to discontinued operations 642 Net profit attributable to discontinued operations principally relates to the profit on disposal of Europe Beverages on 2 February 2006 and South African Beverages on 1 August 2006 and their pre-disposal trading result.

Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The current year tax charge primarily represents tax on the disposal of Europe Beverages.
The prior year adjustment relates to the release of disposal tax provisions.
In 2006, the Group reached agreement with the UK tax authorities as to the tax due in connection with the disposal in 1997 of Coca-Cola & Schweppes Beverages, a UK bottling business, and the disposal in 1999 of the Groups beverage brands in 160 countries.
The original disposal gains, net of tax, were treated as discontinued operations and hence the release of the unutilised provisions has been reported in the same line.
No reconciliation of the tax rate for discontinued operations in 2006 has been provided given the discrete nature of the balances.
