 1  The group financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 112 to 116.
VT Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The accounting policies as set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements and have been applied consistently by group companies.
There were no new accounting standards issued during the year that have a material impact on the groups results.
2  i Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments that have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
The group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds 000 except when otherwise indicated.
ii Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of VT Group plc and its subsidiaries at each balance sheet date and include its share of its joint ventures and associates results on the equity method.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
The results of subsidiaries sold or acquired during the year are consolidated up to, or from, the date control passes.
iii Investments in associates and joint ventures Joint ventures are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its partners under a contractual agreement.
Associates are those businesses in which the group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The groups share of post tax results of joint ventures and associates are included in the consolidated income statement as an element of profit before tax.
In the consolidated balance sheet the net investment is carried as a non-current asset at the share of the joint ventures or associates equity including any goodwill arising on the groups acquisition of its interest.
iv Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable.
Rendering of services Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term or one-off basis is recognised when the service is complete.
The provision of services over a long-term period are treated as construction contracts and the revenue recognised as set out below.
Construction contracts Revenue from construction contracts, including long-term service provision contracts, is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
A prudent level of profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Variations and claims are included where it is probable that the amount will be settled.
When the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred where it is probable that those costs will be recoverable.
Rental and lease income Rental and lease income arising is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the lease term on ongoing leases.
72 &aCCoUNTs2007  2  continued v Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as non-current or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and investment property at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Rental income is recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis.
vi Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not recognised: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting or taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
vii Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated as cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment comprises purchase price and directly attributable costs.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Computer equipment 3 to 5 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Motor vehicles 4 years Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years Heavy equipment 20 to 33 years Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
The residual value and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are reassessed annually and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
viii Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits and can be measured reliably.
Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
73  2  continued ix Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, goodwill is written down and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the estimated value in use.
Value in use is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
x Research costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
xi Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalised at cost and from a business combination are capitalised at fair value as at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalised and expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which the expenditure is incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised as an intangible asset on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Acquired software licences 25 years Brands 35 years Trademarks and licences up to 20 years Customer contracts and relationships up to 30 years Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level.
Useful lives are also examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis.
xii Investment properties Land and buildings that are leased to non-group entities are classified as investment properties.
The group applies the cost model to measure investment properties at their cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of investment properties over their estimated useful lives of up to 50 years.
The residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
xiii Impairment The carrying amount of the groups assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying values may be impaired.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests.
Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
74 &aCCoUNTs2007  2  continued xiv Other investments The group determines the classification of its other investments at initial recognition.
The classification depends upon the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit and loss.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the group has transferred substantially all risk and reward of ownership.
xv Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in-first-out principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
xvi Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identified.
Long-term contract balances are stated at cost less provision for any anticipated losses.
Appropriate provisions for any losses are made in the year they are first foreseen.
Progress payments are amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of the contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery and are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance in respect of progress payments is held in trade and other payables as customer stage payments.
Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less impairment losses.
xvii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts repayable on demand.
xviii Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currency of group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transaction.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to Sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated to Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences that arose before the transition date to IFRSs are deemed to be nil.
xix Derivative financial instruments The group primarily uses foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial statements for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
The group currently has only certain designated cash flow hedges.
75  2  continued In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be effective is recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the profit or loss.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising in fair value are taken directly to profit or loss for the year.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to profit or loss for the year.
xx Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
xxi Retirement benefit plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognised past service costs, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculations, together with the cost of providing benefits under the plans, are performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur and are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
xxii Long-term service benefits The groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
xxiii Share-based payment transactions Share based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the groups share option, incentive and other award schemes.
Share options granted to employees and share based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the vesting period of the scheme, with a corresponding entry recorded within equity.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
The group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
xxiv Provisions Provisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at an appropriate pre-tax discount rate.
76 &aCCoUNTs2007  2  continued Provisions for losses on contracts are recorded when it becomes probable that total estimated contract costs will exceed total contract revenues.
Such provisions are recorded as write downs of work in progress for that portion of the work which has already been completed, and as liability provisions for the remainder.
Losses are determined on the basis of estimated results on completion of contracts which are updated regularly.
A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products and services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty data and a weighting of all possible outcomes against their associated probabilities.
Provisions for restructuring or reorganisation are recognised when the group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligation under the contract.
xxv Accounting for PFI contracts In determining an appropriate accounting policy for the groups interests in PFI projects under adopted IFRSs, the group has considered the current status of the project by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC on accounting for service concession arrangements.
IFRIC published IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements in December 2006 which is applicable for accounting periods commencing after 1 January 2008.
The group has opted not to adopt this pronouncement early and until such time as this pronouncement is adopted, it will continue to apply elements of the approach set out in UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in accounting for its interests in PFI projects.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
Once the accounting model has been determined, the recognised assets and liabilities of the PFI projects are measured in accordance with adopted IFRS.
xxvi Assets held for sale Non-current assets are classified as held for sale when their carrying value will be recovered through disposal rather than continuing use within the business, the asset is available for sale in its present condition and the sale is highly probable.
Following reclassification, non-current assets are measured in the balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair values less costs to sell.
xxvii Critical accounting estimates and judgements An analysis and explanation of the accounting estimates and judgements used in producing this set of financial statements is made in the Business Review on pages 8 to 13. xxviii New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements: Effective date accounting periods International Accounting Standards IFRSs commencing on or after IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 International Financial Reporting Interpretation Committee IFRIC IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their significance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specifically the group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Adoption of IFRIC 12 will require the group to assess all Service Concession Arrangements.
This may result in the recognition or derecognition of certain assets and reclassification of income earned from such contracts.
At the date of these financial statements this assessment has not been completed and any impact on reported results has not been quantified.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of the other standards and interpretations noted above will have a material impact on the groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
77  3 Revenue Revenue disclosed in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2007 2006 Share of Share of joint joint Group venture Total Group venture Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sale of goods 56,061 2,492 58,553 81,415 - 81,415 Revenue from construction contracts 127,980 8,214 136,194 87,925 - 87,925 Rendering of services 600,721 141,363 742,084 529,814 138,086 667,900 Equipment leasing income 67,119 - 67,119 9,296 - 9,296 Property rental income 647 - 647 549 - 549 Revenue 852,528 152,069 1,004,597 708,999 138,086 847,085 No revenue was derived from exchanges of goods or services 2006: nil.
4 segmentreporting Segment information is presented in respect of the groups business and geographical segments.
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be business segments as the groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
Secondary segment information is reported geographically.
The groups geographical segments are based on the location of the groups assets.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
Segment revenue, segment expense and segment result include transfers between business segments.
Those transfers are eliminated in consolidation.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.
The group comprises the following main business segments: Communications provides critical communications services in the broadcast, defence, space, emergency services and security sectors worldwide.
Education and Skills provides a wide range of supporting services to schools, LEAs and central government, including careers guidance and provision of vocational work based training.
VT Services Inc. provides a range of support service activities, including base operations, facilities management and the installation and support of communication systems.
This activity is primarily for the US Department of Defense, operating across the US.
Support Services provides technical services, logistics and training for commercial customers and all three armed services in the UK and around the World.
Activities include facilities management, operation and maintenance of assets, provision of specialist manpower and supply chain management.
Shipbuilding designs and constructs advanced naval vessels for the Royal Navy and navies worldwide.
The segments activities also include the design and manufacture of smaller craft and equipment for the marine, offshore and aerospace markets.

Goodwill of 13.4m was recognised at March 2006 based on provisional fair values.
The fair values have been finalised since March 2006 and in accordance with IFRS 3, an increase to goodwill of 312,000 has been made retrospectively.
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by the board.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 11% and cash flow projections beyond the three year budget are extrapolated using a 2.5% growth rate that is the same as the long-term average growth rate in the UK.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: Gross margin Discount rates Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period Gross margins are based on the current values being achieved.
Discount rates reflect the companys weighted average cost of capital.

Interest of financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

For interest rate swaps broker quotes are used.
Those quotes are back tested using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where discounted cash flow techniques are used, estimated future cash flows are based on managements best estimates and the discount rate is a market related rate for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Where other pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest-bearing loans and borrowings is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Cash flow hedges The group uses forward contracts to hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flows.
Certain of these contracts qualify for hedge accounting and are designated as cash flow hedges.
Gains and losses are held in the cash flow hedge reserve and are recycled to the income statement when the related purchases are recorded and recognised in the income statement.
There is an immaterial amount of hedge ineffectiveness related to these hedges.
Gains and losses on cash flow hedges are ultimately recorded in the income statement consistently with the underlying hedged item.
Any gains or losses on cash flow hedges arising due to hedge ineffectiveness would be shown in the income statement within net financing costs.
At 31 March 2007, the group held foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges of expected future receipts in respect of overseas operations for which the group had firm commitments.

This contract had a fair value of 1,000 at 31 March 2006.
The group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on certain of its bank borrowings.
Contracts with nominal values of 22.1m 2006: 24.7m have fixed interest payments at a weighted average rate of 5.57% 2006: 5.57% for periods up until 2029 and have floating rate interest receipts at 5.2% 2006: 5.2% plus LIBOR.
The fair value liability of swaps entered into at 31 March 2007 is estimated at 244,000 2006: 779,000.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 39,000 2006: 28,000 has been offset against hedged interest payments made in the period.

101  31 share-basedpayments Employee and management share participation plans exist as follows.
All plans are equity-settled except where stated.
Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP The long-term incentive plan was established as an incentive scheme for executive directors and other selected senior executives.
Under the terms of the scheme, employees may be awarded shares equal in value up to 50% of basic salary.
The grant of awards is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
The shares are held in trust and released after three years pro rata to achievement of the performance target.
The performance criteria is the Total Shareholder Return TSR of the comparator group which currently comprises the members of the FTSE250 but excluding Investment Trusts but for future years the remuneration committee has the discretion in addition to relate the TSR to the Defence sector or the Support services sector.
Shares vest fully if the companys performance equals or exceeds the upper quartile of the comparator group but there is no vesting if performance is below the median.
For LTIP awards made prior to July 2005, each time share awards were made under the LTIP employees were entitled to invest, subject to certain conditions, up to 5% of basic salary to purchase additional shares in the company Retained Shares.
These shares are held in the trust for at least three years and they are then matched on a 1:1 basis with further shares Matching Shares.
This element of the scheme has now ceased for all future awards.
The last potential matching share award will vest in July 2008.
Deferred annual bonus scheme DABS The group operates a deferred annual bonus scheme for senior executives.
Under the provisions of the scheme members are required to defer 40% of their annual bonus which is used to acquire shares to that value.
In addition, employees have the option to defer a further portion of annual bonus to acquire additional shares, up to a maximum of 35% of annual bonus.
The deferred shares are held in trust for a period of three years.
At the end of the three year period employees will received these shares together with a matching element from the company.
The quantum of the matching element is dependant upon earnings per share growth targets.
The maximum matching element obtainable is three times the deferred shares originally held for an employee.
Share option plans The group operates two share option plans under which directors and other executives are eligible to participate at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Options are granted at market value, determined immediately before the grant.
Share options vest in equal tranches on the 3rd, 4th and 5th anniversaries of the date of the grant subject to achievement of a performance condition.
The performance condition currently applying is real growth in earnings per share of at least 2% per annum over three consecutive years.
These share options have a maximum life of 10 years.
Share incentive plan SIP The group operates a share incentive plan open to all employees.
Under this plan employees are granted share options subject to the group meeting certain financial profit targets.
Options are granted at the market value on date of the award and vest unconditionally if the employee remains in service for a period of 3 years from the date of the award.
The contractual life of the options is five years and there are no cash settlement alternatives.
Employee Share Option Savings Plans ESOP The group operates Share Option Savings Plans for all eligible employees, whereby employees can save towards the exercise price payable for an award of share options.
The exercise price of these options is set at 90% of the market value of the share price at the date of grant.
Under awards granted by the group, the savings period is ether 3 or 5 years for UK based employees and 2 years for US based employees.
At the end of the savings period the options vest and the option holders have a 6 month window in which to exercise their options.
The following tables sets out share option activity under these plans illustrating the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in share options during the year.

The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the year end was 2.20 4.10 2006: 2.20 2.61.
Share option valuation assumptions The fair value of options granted were measured using the Black-Scholes method for the share option plans and Employee Share Options Savings Plans, the Monte-Carlo method for the grants under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, and a simplified Black-Scholes method for the matching shares granted within the Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The weighted average assumptions used in determining fair value of options granted were as follows: shareoptions  shareoptionsplans savingsplans 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Dividend yield 2.2% 2.9% 2.3% 3.0% 2.4% - Expected volatility 21.0% 23.9% 22.6% 21.8% 21.2% - Risk-free interest rate 4.7% 4.1% 4.7% 4.3% 4.7% - Expected life 3years 3 years 5years 5 years 4years - Exercise price 484p 334p 465p 324p 415p - The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan includes a market vesting condition linked to the Total Shareholder Return TSR of a comparator group which requires the volatility of comparator companies share prices and the average correlation between the share prices of the company and the comparator companies to be considered in assessing the fair value of options granted.
The following approach has been adopted for these items: Comparator company volatility Annualised, daily historic volatility assessed over a period prior to the date of grant that corresponds to the period over which the TSR is being projected: Company correlation Taken as the average correlation of TSR between all of the companies over the same historic period.

106 &aCCoUNTs2007  34  Events after the balance sheet date requires the disclosure of changes in tax rates either enacted or announced after the balance sheet date that significantly effect current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.
The announcement of a change in the UK corporation tax rate from 30% to 28%, effective from 1 April 2008, will impact the deferred tax balances set out in these financial statements.
This change is a nonadjusting event.
35 Capitalcommitments At 31 March 2007 amounts contracted for but not provided in the financial statements for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounted to 9,296,000 2006: 43,000.
36  In the ordinary course of business group companies from time to time enter into contracts which can account for a substantial part of the consolidated revenue.
In connection with these contracts, particularly with overseas customers, group companies are required to undertake significant obligations in relation to the performance and financing of the contracts.
In the opinion of the directors, no provision is required in respect of these obligations.
107  37 Retirementbenefits The group participates in five defined benefit pension schemes: the Shipbuilding Industries Scheme SIPS, LAWDC, the Guidance Enterprise Group Scheme, the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS and a US scheme.
The UK schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered funds.
The US scheme is an unfunded scheme.
The group hold a life assurance policy which is to be used to fund retirement benefits arising.
Under IAS 19 this insurance policy is deemed to be a non-qualifying insurance policy and as such is not an asset of the pension scheme.
The asset is instead a corporate-owned asset and is included within the balance sheet note 19.
Pension contributions are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published forecasts to each category of scheme assets.
The amounts recognised in the group income statement and in the group statement of recognised income and expense for the year are analysed as follows: Year ended 31 March 2007  SIPS LAWDC Guidance LGPS US Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current service cost 15,425 1,008 1,073 1,519 77 19,102 Past service cost 200 - - 44 - 244 Expected return on scheme assets 21,509 1,309 661 1,446 - 24,925 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 16,679 1,101 548 1,225 3 19,556 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 10,795 800 960 1,342 80 13,977  Actual return on scheme assets 23,481 1,139 739 1,416 - 26,775 Expected return on scheme assets 21,509 1,309 661 1,446 - 24,925 1,972 170 78 30 - 1,850 Other actuarial gains and losses 14,362 3,922 660 2,420 7 21,371 Actuarial gains recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 16,334 3,752 738 2,390 7 23,221 108 &aCCoUNTs2007  37 Retirementbenefits continued Year ended 31 March 2006 SIPS LAWDC Guidance LGPS US Total 000 000 000 000 000 000  Current service cost 10,779 732 733 1,154 61 13,459 Curtailments and settlements - - - 448 - 448 Expected return on scheme assets 16,465 960 475 1,147 - 19,047 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 14,900 934 477 1,051 1 17,363 Recognised in arriving at operating profit 9,214 706 735 1,506 62 12,223  Actual return on scheme assets 60,145 3,506 1,867 3,635 - 69,153 Expected return on scheme assets 16,465 960 475 1,147 - 19,047 43,680 2,546 1,392 2,488 - 50,106 Other actuarial gains and losses 44,447 3,265 1,074 2,318 - 51,104 Actuarial gains and losses recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense 767 719 318 170 - 998 The principal assumptions used in determining pension benefit obligations for the groups plans are: siPs lawdC lGPs 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.3% 5.0% 5.3% 5.0% 5.3% 4.9% Expected rate of return on assets: Equities 8.0% 8.0% 8.0% 8.0% 8.0% 7.4% Bonds 4.5% 4.3% 4.5% 4.3% 4.5% 4.6% Future salary increases 4.1% 4.1% 3.0% 4.1% 4.5% 4.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9% 2.8% 2.9% 2.8% 3.0% 3.1% Inflation rate 3.0% 2.9% 3.0% 2.9% 3.0% 3.1% Guidance Us 2007 2006 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.3% 5.0% 5.75% 6.0% Expected rate of return on assets: Equities 8.0% 8.0% - - Bonds 4.5% 4.3% - - Future salary increases 4.1% 4.1% 4.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9% 2.8% - - Inflation rate 3.0% 2.9% 2.7% 2.7% Assumptions for pensioner longevity are based upon actuarial tables relevant to the specific schemes.
For the main SIPS scheme the actuarial table used is PMA 92 PFA 92, which allows for expected increases in longevity.
The table has been adjusted for deferred members and pensioners to reflect actual scheme experience.
In addition the mortality assumption includes a medium cohort effect reflecting improved longevity of members born between 1925 and 1945.
The inclusion of this cohort effect strengthens the mortality assumption within the actuarial calculation.
The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 60 year old male would have a life expectancy to age 87 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 90.
The effect of increasing this assumed life expectancy by one year is predicted to increase the deficit in the schemes by approximately 10m.
The assumption considered to be the most significant is the discount rate adopted.
If the discount rate were to change by 0.1% then it is predicted that the deficit in the scheme would change by 7m.
