Segmental information The principal activity of the Group is the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products.
The management structure is based on geographical regions.
These geographical regions of UK, Germany, Rest of Western Europe, US and Rest of the World have been used as the primary reporting segments.
The manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products is a single integrated business and as a consequence, the Group has only one business segment and no secondary segment disclosure has been made.
Central costs are allocated to segments on the basis of net revenue.
With effect from 1 October 2006, we have reclassied the results of our Austrian business from Germany to Rest of the World to reect the way in which our operations are managed within the Group.
The results for 2006 have been restated accordingly.
Similarly the 2006 results of our US business have been reclassied from Rest of the World to US as the US segment has been introduced following the acquisition of Commonwealth Brands.

This amounts to 326 million based on the number of shares ranking for dividend at 30 September 2007.
At the year end, the shareholders had not yet approved the final dividend and therefore it is not included in the balance sheet as a liability.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

Acquisition of Davidoff cigarette trademark On 5 September 2006, the Group acquired the worldwide Davidoff cigarette trademark for a cash consideration of 368 million.
The Group had been the long term licensee of the trademark following the acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.
Based on the fact that Davidoff is an established international brand with global growth potential, the Directors consider that the Davidoff cigarette trademark has an indefinite life and it is therefore not subject to amortisation.
It is, however, subject to an annual impairment review under the requirements of IAS 36.

The goodwill in the United States arose on the acquisition of Commonwealth Brands in 2007.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash ow projections derived from three-year financial budgets which are based on managements experience and expectations and are approved by the Board annually.
The compound annual growth rates implicit in these plans, which are used for the initial three years in the value-in-use calculations, are shown below.
Cash ows beyond the three year period are extrapolated using the estimated long term growth rate of 3% per annum.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% is used, in line with the Groups weighted average cost of capital.

Borrowings and derivative financial instruments i Management of financial risk The Group operates a centralised treasury function, Group Treasury, that is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its nancing and liquidity requirements.
It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of monthly treasury summaries.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, the Group has decided not to apply hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments as permitted under IAS 39.
The information contained in sections ii and iii below shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading denominated in foreign currencies, the foreign currency borrowings both pre and post cross currency swaps, the translation of the net assets of its foreign operations into the consolidated financial statements and foreign currency denominated costs.
In 2007, 73% of net revenue 2006: 74% and 61% of profit from operations 2006: 62% was in international markets.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company, in particular Taiwanese dollars.
The Group uses foreign currency derivative financial instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, to reduce exposure to the risk that these sales will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
As at 30 September 2007, there were 20 million 2006: 32 million notional outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts, the fair value of which was 0.4 million 2006: 1.4 million.
The material foreign currency denominated costs include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency.
The Group has foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when consolidated into the Group financial statements.
A proportion of the currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is managed through borrowings post cross currency swaps denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to its borrowings and cash deposits.
The most material risk is in respect of its borrowings.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which includes the fair value of the principal amounts due to be exchanged at maturity under cross currency swaps and excludes the fair value of interest rate derivatives and interest accruals.
As at 30 September 2007, approximately 12% 2006: 21% of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 70% in euro 2006: 79% and 18% in US dollars 2006: nil.
Accordingly, the Groups financial results are currently exposed to gains or losses arising from uctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage its interest rate risk on the borrowings, the Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into oating interest rate shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and different maturities to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
As at 30 September 2007, 39% 2006: 42% of adjusted net debt was at a oating rate of interest and 61% 2006: 58% at a xed rate of interest including collars.
88 Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2007 Financial Statements 16.
Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk due to its trade receivables due from customers and cash deposits and financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversied group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk arising from having insufficient funds to meet the nancing needs of the Group.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and short term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group.
As at 30 September 2007 the Group had 777 million 2006: 504 million of undrawn committed facilities, maturing in 2010.
These gures exclude the facilities arranged to finance the potential Altadis acquisition.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be uctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations inuence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries, sourcing from various counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.

Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued iv Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS.
The Group separates the borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into oating interest rate shortly after issue.
The following table sets out the derivative financial instruments held by the Group as at 30 September 2007, and demonstrates the Groups use of those derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposure.
The table presents the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant.
Some of the interest rate swaps have embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and third party advice at 30 September 2007 to determine whether such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
Debt is issued in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of execution.

Borrowings and derivative financial instruments continued v Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 30 September 2007 external loans with a fair value of 3,081 million and $800 million 2006: 3,720 million and $nil and permanent intragroup loans with a fair value of 4,284 million 2006: nil have been designated as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations and are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
In addition, cross currency swaps of 1,516 million 2006: nil are considered to provide commercial hedges against investments in the Groups foreign operations.
However, since we do not apply hedge accounting for our derivative financial instruments the fair value gains and losses on these derivatives are recognised in the income statement.

The derivation of the overall expected return on assets reects the actual asset allocation at the measurement date combined with an expected return for each asset class.
The bond return is based on the prevailing return available on xed interest gilts.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including: the income yield at the measurement date: the long term growth prospects for the economy in general: the long term relationship between each asset class and bond returns: and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.

An actuarial valuation of the ITPF the triennial valuation, for funding purposes was made at 31 March 2004 by Watson Wyatt Limited.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.85% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.5% and 2.75% respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2004 the market value of the assets of the ITPF was 2,248 million.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 108% of the benets that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
However, the assets were not sufficient to cover future service benets for current members and, as a result of this deficiency, the Group recommenced payment of employers contributions during the financial year 2004 05 at the level of 10 million per year as set by the ITPF Actuary.
The financial position of the ITPF and the level of contributions to be paid will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2007 and will consider the scheme as at 31 March 2007.
Assuming the level of contributions to the ITPF remains at 10 million following completion of the ITPF triennial valuation which may not prove to be the case the Group expects to contribute a total of 20 million to its funded dened benefit schemes in the year to 30 September 2008.

Pricing For the purposes of valuing awards to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used for all the share option and share matching schemes and for the LTIPs except for the LTIPs granted since November 2005, where the Monte Carlo model has been used.
A summary of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for 2007 and 2006 is as follows: 2007 2006 Sharesave Share match Sharesave Share match Risk-free interest rate 4.6% 5.5% 5.2% 3.6% 5.5% 4.2% Volatility 15.0% 20.0% 17.0% 16.0% 21.0% 17.0% Expected lives of options granted 3 5 yrs 6 mths 3 yrs 3 5 yrs 6 mths 3 yrs Dividend yield 3.6% 3.6% 3.9% 3.9% Fair value 4.62 5.75 19.69 3.46 4.33 15.58 Share price used to determine exercise price 21.53 21.83 21.96 16.69 17.44 17.52 Exercise price 17.22 17.46 n a 13.35 13.95 n a Market condition features were incorporated into the Monte Carlo model for the total shareholder return elements of the LTIP, in determining fair value at grant date.

Acquisitions 2007 On 2 April 2007, the Group acquired from Houchens Industries Inc 100% of the share capital of CBHC Inc, which trades as Commonwealth Brands and manufactures and sells quality discount cigarettes across the United States.
The acquired business contributed revenue of 252 million and profit from operations of 35 million after charging trademark amortisation of 17 million in the period from 2 April 2007 to 30 September 2007.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 October 2006, Group revenue would have been 12,561 million and Group profit from operations for the year would have amounted to 1,446 million, these amounts having been estimated by including Commonwealth Brands results for the six months prior to acquisition adjusted to reect the Groups accounting policies and changes in depreciation and amortisation due to fair value adjustments.
During the year the Group also acquired interests in a number of small businesses including in January 2007 a controlling interest in Tremaco, a tobacco and tobacco-related products distribution business based in Estonia.
The aggregate consideration for these acquisitions amounted to 1 million.
Full IFRS disclosures have not been provided for these small acquisitions as they are not considered to be significant to the Group as a whole.

The fair and book value of the net assets acquired were 2 million, giving rise to goodwill of 11 million.
Full IFRS disclosures have not been presented as these acquisitions are not considered significant to the Group as a whole.
The acquisition of the worldwide Davidoff cigarette trademark announced in August 2006 has, in accordance with IFRS 3, not been treated as a business combination as the substance of the transaction is the purchase of an intangible asset.
This is dealt with in note 9 Intangible Assets.
