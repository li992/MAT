A summary of the Companys principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently throughout the period and the preceding period is set out below.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law.
Exemptions The directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and not presented a profit and loss account for the Company alone.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 Cash flow statements.
The cash flows of the Company are included in the William Hill PLC Group financial statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Parties from disclosing related party transactions with entities that are part of the William Hill PLC Group.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
Cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration that includes the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at an average rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of that debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is reduced by payments made in the period.
Accrued finance costs are included within accruals and deferred income.
