The table overleaf summarises these repricing Group's loan assets.
It remains to ensure that sufficient mismatches.
For the purposes of the table, loan assets, funding is available to fund the Group's participation in the borrowings and derivatives are allocated to time bands by SPVs, provide capital support for new loans and working reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate capital for the Group.
This responsibility rests with the Asset repricing date and the maturity dates.

rates being charged on similar products in the market.
Generally this ensures the matching of changes in interest rates on the Group's loan assets and borrowings and any exposure arising on the interest rate resets is relatively short term.
Forward rate agreements may be used to hedge against any perceived risk of temporary increases in LIBOR rates at month ends.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued The Asset and Liability Committee monitors the interest rate risk exposure on the Group's loan assets and asset backed loan notes and ensures compliance with the requirements of the trustees in respect of the Group's securitisations.
The only interest rate risk in the Company arises from the corporate bond described above which is a fixed rate instrument, until its maturity in 2017, which is fully hedged.
Loans to associates and inter company assets and liabilities bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR which reset within three months of the balance sheet date.
The finance lease bears notional interest only: all other balances are non-interest bearing.
Currency risk All of the Group's assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling with the exception of the asset backed loan notes denominated in US dollars and euros, which are described in note 45.
Although IAS 39 requires that they be accounted for as currency liabilities and valued at their spot rates, it was a condition of the issue of these notes that interest rate and currency swaps were put in place for the duration of the borrowing, having the effect of converting the liability to a LIBOR linked floating rate sterling borrowing.
As a result the Group has no material exposure to foreign currency risk.
The equivalent sterling principal amounts of notes in issue under these arrangements, and their carrying values at 30 September 2007 and 30 September 2006 are: 2007 2007 2006 2006 EQUIVALENT CARRYING EQUIVALENT CARRYING STERLING VALUE STERLING VALUE PRINCIPAL PRINCIPAL m m m m US dollar notes 4,551.0 4,177.5 2,416.6 2,313.2 Euro notes 2,699.3 2,773.5 2,118.6 2,103.0 7,250.3 6,951.0 4,535.2 4,416.2 52 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC Use of derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Such instruments are used only to limit the exposure of the Group to movements in market interest or exchange rates, as described above.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken, and hence all of the Group's derivative financial instruments are for commercial hedging purposes.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures principally arising from fixed rate lending or borrowing and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
Hedge accounting is applied where appropriate, though it should be noted that some derivatives, while forming part of an economic hedge relationship, do not qualify for this accounting treatment under IAS 39 either because natural accounting offsets are expected, or obtaining hedge accounting would be especially onerous.
The Group has designated a number of derivatives as fair value hedges.
In particular this treatment is used for: a hedging the interest rate risk of groups of fixed rate prepayable loan assets with interest rate derivatives on a portfolio basis.
The Group believes this solution is the most appropriate as it is consistent with the economic hedging approach taken by the Group to these assets.
b hedging the interest rate risk of fixed rate corporate bond borrowings with a designated fixed to floating interest rate swap.
The Group has also designated cash flow hedging relationships, principally arising from currency borrowings, where a specified foreign exchange basis swap, set up as part of the terms of the borrowing is used.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values have been determined for all derivatives, listed securities and any other financial assets and liabilities for which an active and liquid market exists.
The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, bank loans and overdrafts and asset backed loan notes are not materially different from their book values because all the assets mature within three months of the year end and the interest rates charged on financial liabilities reset on a quarterly basis.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at their fair values.
The fair values of the interest rate swaps and caps have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets on which these instruments are traded.
The fair value of loans to customers is considered to be not materially different to the amortised cost value at which they are disclosed.

SEGMENTAL INFORMATION For management purposes the Group is organised into two major operating divisions, First Mortgages and Consumer Finance, which includes secured lending, car and retail finance and the residual unsecured loans book which formed part of Other Operations in the year ending 30 September 2006.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports primary segmental information.
All of the Group's operations are conducted in the United Kingdom.
This represents a change from the basis reported in 2006 in that the closed, owner-occupied first mortgage book and the closed unsecured book, which together comprised the Other Operations category last year, are now included within the First Mortgages and Consumer Finance segments respectively.
For reporting purposes these books were absorbed within the results from the two main business areas because their reduced size had rendered the Other Operations segment insignificant in terms of assets, revenue and net profits.
Financial information about these business segments is shown below.

The awards will lapse to the extent that the performance condition has not been satisfied on the third anniversary.

35% of each element of the award will vest for median performance with full vesting for upper quartile performance: between these points awards will vest on a straight line basis.
For below median performance, none of the relevant element of the award will vest.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee will have regard to the underlying financial performance of the Company as compared with the level of TSR and EPS performance.

FAIR VALUE NET GAINS The fair value net gain of 4.3m 2006: 2.5m represents the accounting volatility on derivative instruments which are matching risk exposure on an economic basis.
Some accounting volatility arises on these items due to accounting ineffectiveness on designated hedges, or because hedge accounting has not been adopted or is not achievable on certain items.
The gain is primarily due to timing differences in income recognition between the derivative instruments and the economically hedged assets and liabilities.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES All of the Group's financial derivatives are held for economic hedging purposes, although not all may be designated for hedge accounting in accordance with the provisions of IAS 39.
The analysis below therefore splits derivatives between those accounted for as hedges and those which, while representing an economic hedge do not qualify for this treatment.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are included within Financial Assets note 24 and Financial Liabilities note 44 respectively.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2004 and updated to 30 September 2007 by a qualified independent actuary.
The liabilities of the benefit scheme are measured by discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the Projected Unit method.
This amount is reflected in the asset in the balance sheet.
The Projected Unit method is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the technical provisions are calculated based on service up until the valuation date allowing for future salary growth until the date of retirement, withdrawal or death, as appropriate.
The future service rate is then calculated as the contribution rate required to fund the service accruing over the control period again allowing for future salary growth.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost will increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
The major weighted average assumptions used by the actuary were in nominal terms : 30 SEPTEMBER 30 SEPTEMBER 2007 2006 In determining net pension cost for the year Discount rate 5.20% 5.10% Rate of compensation increase 3.70% 3.50% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued before 6 April 2006 2.70% 2.50% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 2.25% 2.25% in deferment 2.70% 2.50% In determining benefit obligations Discount rate 6.10% 5.20% Rate of compensation increase 4.10% 3.70% Rate of increase of pensions in payment accrued before 6 April 2006 3.10% 2.70% in payment accrued after 5 April 2006 2.50% 2.25% in deferment 3.10% 2.70% Further life expectancy at age 60 Pensioner male 26 26 Pensioner female 29 29 Non-retired member male 29 28 Non-retired member female 32 31 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC 79 30.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The assets in the Plan at 30 September 2007 and 30 September 2006 and the expected rates of return were: AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2007 AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2006 LONG VALUE ASSET LONG VALUE ASSET TERM RATE ALLOCATION TERM RATE ALLOCATION OF RETURN OF RETURN EXPECTED EXPECTED m m Equities 7.7% 37.4 76.0% 7.0% 32.7 74.5% Bonds 5.6% 11.7 23.8% 4.3% 11.2 25.5% Other 0.5% 0.1 0.2% -- - Total market value of assets 49.2 43.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 45.0 43.6 Surplus deficit in the scheme 4.2 0.3 The pension scheme assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
The trustees of the fund are required to act in the best interests of the fund's beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees to the fund is determined by the scheme's trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by active and pensioner members of the fund.
At 30 September 2007 the scheme assets were invested in a diversified portfolio that consisted primarily of equity and gilt investments.
The target asset allocations for the year ending 30 September 2008 are 75% equities, 20% bonds and 5% other assets.
In conjunction with the trustees, the Group has recently conducted an asset-liability review of the Group.
These studies are used to assist the trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the scheme.
The results of the study are used to assist the trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and risk of a significant increase in the scheme deficit by providing information used to determine the pension scheme investment strategy.
The majority of the equities held by the scheme are in international blue chip entities.
To maintain a wide range of diversification, a proportion of the equity investment approximately 5% is to be diverted to a diversified growth fund or GTAA during 2007.
The rate of return expected on scheme assets is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The movement in the market value of the scheme assets during the year was as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 October 2006 43.9 24.5 Movement in year Contributions by the Group 2.0 17.2 Contributions by scheme members 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid 0.8 0.8 Expected return on scheme assets 2.8 2.2 Actuarial gain 0.9 0.4 At 30 September 2007 49.2 43.9 The actual rate of return on scheme assets in the year ended 30 September 2007 was 8.6% 2006: 11.4% 80 The Paragon Group of Companies PLC The movement in the present value of the scheme liabilities during the year was as follows: 2007 2006 m m At 1 October 2006 43.6 39.1 Movement in year Current service cost 1.9 1.9 Past service costs 0.1 - Contributions by scheme members 0.4 0.4 Benefits paid 0.8 0.8 Finance cost 2.3 2.0 Actuarial gain loss 2.5 1.0 At 30 September 2007 45.0 43.6 The most recent valuation of the scheme liabilities on a buy out basis obtained by the trustees in accordance with section 224 of the Pensions Act 2004 was calculated at 30 September 2006, when the valuation on that basis was 85.3m.
The sensitivity of the valuation of the scheme liabilities to the principal assumptions disclosed above at 30 September 2007 is as follows: INCREASE IN IMPACT ON ASSUMPTION ASSUMPTION SCHEME LIABILITIES Discount rate 0.1% Decrease by 2.6% Rate of inflation 0.1% Increase by 2.4% Rate of salary growth 0.1% Increase by 0.9% Rates of mortality 1 year of life expectancy Increase by 1.9% maintaining a 1% real increase in salary growth The duration of the scheme's liabilities are shown in the table below: DURATION OF LIABILITY CATEGORY OF MEMBER YEARS Active members 29 Deferred pensioners 28 Current pensioners 13 All members 28 The Group's funding objective for the plan is to achieve within 15 years, and then maintain, a funding target which requires assets equal to 100% of the present value of benefits based on completed service including provision for the effects of future salary growth and inflation up to retirement.
The agreed rate of employer contributions was 38.4% of gross salaries for participating employees until 31 March 2006 and 24.5% of gross salaries for participating employees thereafter.
The Group and the Trustees are currently involved in discussions regarding the level of contributions which will be made to the plan by the Group in the year ending 30 September 2008.

These swaps provide an effective hedge against exchange rate movements, but the requirement to carry them at fair value leads, when exchange rates have moved significantly since the issue of the notes, to large balances for the swaps being carried in the balance sheet.
This is currently the case with US dollar swaps, although the credit balance is compensated for by retranslating the borrowings at the current exchange rate.

a Asset Backed Loan Notes The asset backed loan notes are secured on portfolios comprising variable and fixed rate mortgages or personal, retail and car loans, and are redeemable in part from time to time, but such redemptions are limited to the net capital received from borrowers in respect of the underlying assets.
There is no requirement for the Group to make good any shortfall out of general funds.
The maturity date of the notes matches the maturity date of the underlying assets.
It is likely that a substantial proportion of these notes will be repaid within five years.
In each issue there exists an option for the Group to repay all of the notes at an earlier date the 'call date', at the outstanding principal amount.
Interest is payable at a fixed margin above: the London Interbank Offered Rate 'LIBOR' on notes denominated in sterling: the Euro Interbank Offered Rate 'EURIBOR' on notes denominated in euros: and the London Interbank Offered Rate 'US Dollar LIBOR' on notes denominated in US dollars.
All payments in respect of the notes are required to be made in the currency in which they are denominated.

The facility is secured by a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Company, Paragon Finance PLC and certain other Group companies.
Assets are typically securitised within twelve months of origination.
Until that point new loans are funded by a bank facility the 'warehouse facility'.
This is drawn down to fund completions and repaid when assets are securitised.
More information on this process is given in note 4.
The warehouse facility is currently provided by a committed sterling facility provided to Paragon Second Funding Limited by a consortium of banks.
This facility is secured on all the assets of Paragon Second Funding Limited, Paragon Car Finance Limited and Paragon Personal Finance Limited.
This facility remains available for further drawings until 29 February 2008 and although its final repayment date is 28 February 2050 it is likely that substantial repayments will be made within the next five years.
