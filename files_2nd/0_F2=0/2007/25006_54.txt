Resolution 9 presents the remuneration report for the year ended 31 March 2007 to the shareholders for approval under section 241A of the Companies Act 1985 as amended.
The remuneration report can be found on pages 43 to 50.
10 That the directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 and in accordance with Article 9.2 of the Companys articles of association, to exercise all the powers of the Company to allot relevant securities within the meaning of section 80 2 of the said Act up to an aggregate nominal amount of 21,565,972, being 33% of the issued share capital excluding Treasury Shares of the Company as at 11 May 2007, the latest practicable date before publication of this notice this authority to expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting for 2008, save that the Company may before such expiry make any offer or agreement which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of any offer or agreement as if the authority conferred hereby had not expired.
This authority shall be in substitution for and shall replace any existing authority pursuant to the said section 80, to the extent not utilised at the date this resolution is passed.
Under the Companies Act 1985, the directors may not allot unissued shares in the Company without the authority of shareholders in general meeting, except for the issue of shares under the Companys share or share option plans.
The authority contained in resolution 10 would permit the directors to issue securities up to an aggregate nominal amount of 21,565,972.
Special resolutions 11 That in accordance with Article 9.3 of the Companys articles of association, the directors be and are hereby empowered pursuant to section 95 1 of the Companies 1985 the Act : a subject to the passing of resolution 10 above, to allot equity securities as defined in section 94 2 of the said Act for cash pursuant to the authority conferred by resolution 10 above as if section 89 1 of the Act did not apply to any such allotment: b to sell relevant shares as defined in section 94 5 of the said Act in the Company if, immediately before the sale such shares are held by the Company as Treasury Shares as defined in section 162A 3 of the said Act Treasury Shares for cash as defined in section 162D 2 of the said Act, as if section 89 1 of the said Act did not apply to any such sale: provided that this power shall be limited to the allotment of equity securities and the sale of Treasury Shares: i in connection with a rights issue or any other pre-emptive offer in favour of ordinary shareholders where the equity securities are proportionate as nearly as practicable to the respective number of ordinary shares held by such holders but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem necessary or desirable in relation to fractional entitlements or legal or practical problems arising in, or pursuant to, the laws of any territory, or the requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange in any territory: and ii otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph i above, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,228,426: and this power shall expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting for 2008, save that the Company may before such expiry make an offer or enter into any agreement which would or might require equity securities to be allotted or Treasury Shares to be sold, after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities or sell Treasury Shares in pursuance of such offer or agreement as if the power conferred hereby had not expired.
Resolution 11 empowers the directors to allot ordinary shares, otherwise than on a pro-rata basis to existing shareholders in connection with any future rights issue or grant rights over shares or sell Treasury Shares for cash, up to an aggregate nominal amount of 3,228,426 being approximately 5% in value of the existing issued share capital at 11 May 2007, the latest practicable date before publication of this notice.
It is not intended that the Company will allot in this way more than 7.5% of the unissued share capital in any rolling three-year period.
The authorities in resolutions 10 and 11 will last for a period of one year each, in accordance with institutional guidelines.
The directors have no present intention of exercising these authorities.
It is normal for boards of listed companies to have these authorities in order to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise.
Notice of annual general meeting ICAP plc 119 Annual Report 2007 12 That the Company be and is hereby generally authorised pursuant to and in accordance with section 166 of the Companies Act 1985 to make market purchases within the meaning of section 163 3 of such Act of any of its own ordinary shares on such terms and in such manner as the directors may from time to time determine subject to the following: a the maximum number of shares in the Company hereby authorised to be acquired is 64,697,917: b the minimum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for each such ordinary share is an amount equal to the nominal value of each share: c the maximum price, exclusive of expenses, which may be paid for any share is an amount equal to 105% of the average of the middle market quotations for the shares in the Company taken from the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which such ordinary share is contracted to be purchased: d the authority hereby conferred shall expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting: and e the Company may enter into a contract for the purchase of shares before the expiry of this authority which would or might be completed wholly or partly after its expiry.
Resolution 12 empowers the Company to purchase its own ordinary shares by market purchases not exceeding approximately 10% of the Companys issued share capital as at 11 May 2007.
The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution.
The directors believe that it is advantageous for the Company to continue to have this flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares.
In the event that shares are purchased, they would either be cancelled and the number of shares in issue would be reduced accordingly or retained as Treasury Shares with a view to possible re-sale at a future date.
The Company would consider holding repurchased shares pursuant to the authority conferred by this resolution as Treasury Shares.
This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Treasury Shares quickly and cost effectively and would provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.
The directors would exercise this authority only if they were satisfied that a purchase would result in an increase in expected EPS and would be in the interests of shareholders generally.
The authority given in the resolution will expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting to be held in 2008.
Ordinary resolutions 13 That the Company and its directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised to make Donations to EU political organisations and to incur EU political expenditure up to an aggregate amount of 100,000 for the Group, this authority to expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2008.
For the purposes of this resolution, Donation, EU political organisations and EU political expenditure have the meanings ascribed in section 347A of the Companies Act 1985 and Group shall have the meaning ascribed thereto by the Companys articles of association.
14 That ICAP Management Services Limited and its directors be and are hereby generally and unconditionally authorised to make Donations to EU political organisations and to incur EU political expenditure up to an aggregate amount of 100,000 for the Group, this authority to expire at the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company to be held in 2008.
Resolutions 13 and 14 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions to approve the making of political donations and incurring of political expenditure by the Company and its subsidiary ICAP Management Services Limited of up to an aggregate amount of 100,000 in the period to the Companys annual general meeting to be held in 2008.
The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, contains restrictions on companies making donations to EU political organisations or incurring EU political expenditure without prior shareholder approval.
15 That the Company is hereby authorised to send or supply documents or information to shareholders by making them available on a website for the purposes of paragraph 10 2 of Schedule 5 to the Companies Act 2006 and otherwise: and to use electronic means within the meaning of the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules Sourcebook published by the Financial Services Authority to convey information to shareholders.
Legislation was announced earlier this year making it easier to communicate with shareholders electronically using, for example, emails and the internet.
The directors believe that there are significant benefits for both shareholders and the Company from introducing electronic communications consistent with this legislation, for documents such as annual and half-yearly reports and circulars.
Resolution 15 will allow the Company to take advantage of the new rules on electronic communications in the Companies Act 2006 on implied website usage and, as a listed company, to benefit from the rules on electronic and website communications in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules which came into force in January 2007.
