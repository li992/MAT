When calculating the value of new business, priority is given to relieving the expenses relating to that business.
Assumptions a Economic assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December 2007 are set out below: Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 Million Million Risk free rate 4.7% 4.9% Inflation rate 3.1% 3.0% Risk discount rate net of tax 7.8% 8.0% Future investment returns: - Gilts 4.7% 4.9% - Equities 7.7% 7.9% - Unit linked funds - Capital growth 3.9% 4.5% - Dividend income 3.2% 2.8% - Total 7.1% 7.3% Expense inflation 3.8% 3.6% Indexation of capital gains 2.2% 2.2% The risk free rate is set by reference to the yield on 10 year gilts.
Other investment returns are set by reference to the risk free rate.
The inflation rate is derived from the implicit inflation in the valuation of 10 year index-linked gilts.
This rate is increased to reflect higher increases in earnings related expenses.
The inflation rate is reduced by 10% to derive the indexation of capital gains for the proportion of the fund invested in equities.
b Experience assumptions The principal experience assumptions have been set on a best estimate basis.
The persistency assumptions are derived from the Groups own experience, or where insufficient data exists, from external industry experience.
The expense assumptions include allowance for both the costs charged by the relevant third party administrators for acquisition and maintenance, and the corporate costs incurred in respect of covered business.
The corporate costs have been apportioned so that the total maintenance costs represent the anticipated ongoing expenses, including systems development costs, which are expected to arise in future years in meeting the policy servicing requirements of the in-force business.
