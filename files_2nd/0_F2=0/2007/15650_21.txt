NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Thomas Cook Group plc is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered of ce is The Thomas Cook Business Park, Coningsby Road, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire PE3 8SB.
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Business Review and the Financial Review on pages 25 to 35.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 January 2008.
Following the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc on 19 June 2007, 52 per cent of the fully diluted share capital of the Company is controlled by Arcandor AG.
As part of this transaction, all parties entered into a relationship agreement that enshrined the principle agreed between the parties that the Thomas Cook Group will operate independently from Arcandor AG and in accordance with the highest standards of corporate governance best practice.
It also sets out the agreement of the parties regarding the composition of the Board of the Company.
The Directors consider that Arcandor AG is the Companys ultimate controlling party.
The largest and smallest group of undertakings for which consolidated financial statements are prepared and which includes the financial statements of the Thomas Cook Group is that headed by Arcandor AG.
Arcandor AG is incorporated in Germany and copies of its financial statements, which are publicly available, may be obtained from Arcandor AG, Theodor-Althoff-Str.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations that are expected to impact on the Group, but which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective.
With the exception of changes in disclosure, the Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
The Directors anticipate that the Group will adopt these standards and interpretations on their effective dates.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented.
Basis of preparation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common control, the requirements of IFRS 3 are applied and the combination is accounted for using the purchase method.
Where audited financial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the financial information has been derived from the last audited accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Companys balance sheet date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
On 19 June 2007, Thomas Cook AG TCAG merged with MyTravel Group plc to become Thomas Cook Group plc TCG plc.
For statutory purposes the transaction is treated as a business combination effected by a new parent company, TCG plc.
However, for accounting purposes this is a reverse acquisition of TCG plc by TCAG with the overall effect being that TCAG is treated as the acquirer of both TCG plc and MyTravel Group plc.
These financial statements therefore include the full year of trading for TCAG and the trading of MyTravel Group plc for the period from 19 June 2007 to 31 October 2007.
The comparative information includes the full year of trading for TCAG and none of the MyTravel Group plc results.
All of the TCAG financial information has been presented in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Following the business combination, TCAG changed its accounting policy for pension accounting and made certain changes to the presentation of financial information from that in the TCAG financial statements for the year ended 31 October 2006.
These presentational changes related to certain classi cations and had no impact on the income statement or on net assets.
In its financial statements, TCAG had previously applied the corridor method to recognise in the income statement actuarial gains and losses over the expected working lives of employees in the plans.
The Group now recognises all actuarial gains and losses arising from fide ned bene t plans directly in equity.
As a consequence of listing in the UK and to bring the Group in line with prevailing practice in the UK, the Directors consider full recognition of the actuarial gains and losses in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense is more appropriate.
The change in accounting policy has been recognised retrospectively and the 2006 comparatives have been restated from the TCAG financial statements.
The impact of the change in policy is shown in the notes to the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing and other arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
As a consequence, the Group has consolidated 12 SPEs.
The Directors consider that the principal functional currency of the Group is the euro and have therefore decided to adopt the euro as the presentational currency.
Associates and joint ventures Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts signi cant in uence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, after adjustment for goodwill.
72|THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Other non-current asset investments Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured at cost.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are not amortised.
For all other intangible assets amortisation is charged on a straight line basis over the assets useful life, as follows: Brands 10 years to inde nite life Customer relationships 1 to 5 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years New aircraft 12 to 20 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other xed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007|73 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 13 14 15 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Non-current assets held for sale The Group classi es non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
To be classi ed as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets and their sale must be highly probable.
Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated, at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classi cation.
Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale are carried on the Groups balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs The cost of major overhauls of owned and finance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over between two and 10 years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is carried out under xed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours own and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain of the operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Revenue recognition and associated costs Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, travel agency commissions receivable and other services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday departure.
Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure.
Other revenue and associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred.
Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Income statement presentation Pro t or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Groups management consider should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is signi cant and the Groups management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
Tax Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable pro ts based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below.
This is calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
74|THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable pro ts is probable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Pensions Pension costs charged against pro ts in respect of the Groups fide ned contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The Group also operates a number of fide ned bene t schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other movements in the pension liability are recognised in the income statement.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than the euro.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are dealt with through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is dealt with in the income statement.
Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
When a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a derivative quali es for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a nonfinancial liability, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For all other cash ow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects pro t or loss.
When a derivative quali es for hedge accounting as a fair value hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative are recognised in the income statement when they offset changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, attributable to the hedged risk.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset or when the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged or cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments are classi ed as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised and subsequently recorded at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Share-based payments The Group issues share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity reserves.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, less cancellations.
Premiums are recognised as revenue earned premiums proportionally over the period of coverage.
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders.
The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not reported.
76|THOMAS COOK GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 2.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group and that meet the classi cation requirements for insurance contracts are classi ed as reinsurance contracts held.
The bene ts to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Residual values of tangible xed assets Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment.
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash ows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities The nature of the relationship with certain SPEs involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life at the balance sheet date were 3,550.0 million and 282.4 million respectively.
No impairment losses were recorded during the year.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft eet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities to be agreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent managements estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future pro tability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses and deferred tax assets have been recognised.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future pro tability.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS continued In accordance with accounting standards, the Group annually tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment.
At 31 October 2007, the review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash ows derived from those assets, using cash ow projections discounted at 10 per cent to 11 per cent 2006: 11.8 per cent to 15.4 per cent.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and three year plans of the relevant businesses.
The cash ow forecasts re ect the risk associated with each asset.
Cash ow forecasts for years beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
The goodwill attributable to Airlines Germany is supported by the fair value less costs to sell of the business.
There were no impairment losses for the year 2006: nil.

As a consequence, the Group has consolidated 12 SPEs that own 11 aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third-party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies and historically have covered periods from one to 36 months in advance.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally only be made for periods of up to 12 months in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 78.4 million 2006: 40.1 million of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK Airline.
Securities include money market securities amounting to 5.5 million 2006: 5.2 million purchased as collateral against liabilities arising from part-time retirement contracts at Thomas Cook AG.
Current asset securities of 366.7 million 2006: 72.7 million include 292.3 million 2006: nil in relation to a managed investment fund established to optimise the utilisation of the Groups surplus liquidity.
The fund is classi ed as held-for-trading investments and includes corporate and government bonds 239.4 million, quoted 10.2 million and unquoted 37.6 million securities and other assets 5.1 million.
Securities also include money market deposits with a maturity of greater than three months of 74.4 million 2006: 72.7 million which are also classi ed as held-for-trading investments.
Loans include advances of 2.6 million 2006: 2.6 million to two hotel companies in which the Group has a participating interest.
These loans are interest bearing at rates based on Euribor and are unsecured.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables of 73.2 million 2006: 54.1 million.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identi ed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Trade and other receivables are not subject to restrictions on title.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.

The Group enters into a variety of foreign currency forward contracts, options and other financial instruments approved by the Board in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments used are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets, predominantly euro, US dollar and sterling, and are typically established for periods of 12 to 24 months in advance of a season to which the expected cash exposures pertain.
Price hedging transactions are also undertaken in order to limit the risk of unfavourable changes in the price of fuel, which is denominated in US dollars, for up to three future seasons.
At 31 October 2007, the Group had put in place hedging transactions for fuel volumes of 1,675,555 metric tonnes 2006: 1,346,218 metric tonnes with terms running up until October 2009 at the latest.
Use was primarily made of hedge combinations and crude oil price range options as hedging instruments, together with limited use of gas oil and kerosene derivatives and derivatives for hedging price differentials between the various product groups cracks.
The Group is also subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the nancing of aircraft and acquisition of investments.
Floating rate medium to long-term borrowings are exposed to interest rate change risks.
Interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps are designated as cash ow hedges of the interest rate and the US dollar euro currency risk on such borrowings.
Other instruments used to manage interest rate risk include forward rate agreements and caps.
Interest rate currency swaps are reported within interest rate derivatives.
The maturities of interest rate derivatives extend out to mid 2011 at the latest.
The oating interest rates for interest rate swaps are based on the six month Euribor.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments set out above have been determined by reference to prices available from the markets in which the instruments are traded.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Management of insurance and financial risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer signi cant insurance risk and that are classi ed as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group fide fines as signi cant insurance risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a speci ed uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by speci c limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Scandinavia.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the Board which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of B A M Best or above.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax liabilities 120.2 0.1 Deferred tax assets 418.5 260.0 298.3 259.9 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 1,800.0 million 2006: 478.0 million available for offset against future pro ts.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised where there is suf cient probability that there will be future taxable pro ts against which the assets may be recovered.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 800.0 million 2006: 162.0 million due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
In addition, the Group had unused other short-term timing differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting to 67.0 million 2006: nil, also due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same tax authority.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which no deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was 386.0 million 2006: nil.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Reductions in corporate tax rates in the UK from 30 per cent to 28 per cent, which will be effective from 1 April 2008, and in Germany from 38 per cent to 29 per cent, which will have effect from 1 November 2007, have been taken into account in determining the deferred tax balances at 31 October 2007.
The effect is a reduction in the deferred tax assets in those countries, resulting in an additional tax charge in the income statement of 9.7 million.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of fide ned contribution plans and fide ned bene t plans, with the fide ned bene t plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from fide ned contribution plans are satis ed by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 202.2 million 2006: 254.1 million were attributable to the pension commitments of Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Condor Berlin GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The ight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their inight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the bene t commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their inight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company after 1994 participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classi ed as unfunded fide ned bene t obligations and classi ed as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group fide ned bene t plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded fide ned bene t obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in Sweden.
The unfunded pension bene ts are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement bene t obligations in the balance sheet.
The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded fide ned bene t obligations: 2007 2006 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.50 4.25 Expected rate of salary increases 2.80 2.68 Future pension increases 2.00 2.68 The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr Klaus Heubeck were used as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 31 October 2007.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 22.35 years for men and 26.98 years for women.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of these fide ned bene t schemes are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Current service cost 15.1 15.9 Past service cost 0.1 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 11.7 10.5 Total included in income statement 26.8 26.5 Service costs have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement bene t obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.

Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of quali ed actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement bene t obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement bene t obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded fide ned bene t pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country and the weighted averages of these were: 2007 2006 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.70 4.95 In ation rate 3.25 2.90 Expected return on scheme assets 7.10 7.30 Expected rate of salary increases 4.50 4.15 Future pension increases 3.25 2.90 The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 90 per cent of the total funded fide ned bene t obligations and the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 31 October 2007 are based on a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 25.2 years for men and 28.3 years for women.
The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2003.
Employees who have joined since that date participate in a new fide ned contribution scheme.
