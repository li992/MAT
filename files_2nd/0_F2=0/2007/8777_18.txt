Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Impairment of goodwill The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying amount of goodwill requires a comparison of the present value of the retail operating units for which goodwill has been allocated, to the value of goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet.
The calculation of present value requires an estimation of the future post tax cash flows expected to arise from the operating units and the selection of a suitable discount rate.
The carrying amount of goodwill in the Consolidated balance sheet at 28 January 2007 was 188,459,000 2006: 186,084,000 and following the impairment review, no impairment charge was necessary at either date.
Impairment of subsidiary undertakings The calculation for considering the impairment of the carrying value of subsidiary undertakings requires a comparison of the present value of the operating units within the subsidiary undertakings to the value of those subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet.
The carrying amount of subsidiary undertakings in the Company balance sheet at 28 January 2007 was 250,447,000 2006: 248,310,000 and following the impairment review, no impairment charge was necessary in the accounting period to 28 January 2007 2006: 40,851,000.

Following the agreement of these corporation tax liabilities, the deferred tax liability arising on the difference between the net book value of property, plant and equipment and their tax written down value, was recalculated and the provision reduced.
The deferred taxation charge in the current period has resulted from the depreciation rates on qualifying assets being lower than capital allowance rates for tax purpose.

Both facilities were arranged at interest rates fixed to LIBOR and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Loan notes were issued to the vendors of Blane Leisure Limited Sports Division in September 1998, as part of the consideration for the acquisition of that Company and its subsidiaries, under an instrument which provided that the loan notes were redeemable on any quarterly interest payment dates after 11 June 1999.
By a Deed of Variation dated 26 February 2001, the maturity date up to which the loan notes can be redeemed was extended to 28 April 2011.
Interest is payable on the loan notes at a quarterly rate linked to LIBOR and the loan notes are secured by an identical amount held in a bank account and shown under Current assets as Current asset investment, as described in note 19 of these Notes to the Financial statements on page 54.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Group and Companys borrowings to be the same as the carrying value.
At 28 January 2007, the Group had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of 45 million 2006: nil, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

Included within this is the provision for the closure of the Icon stores.
The dilapidations provision is the best estimate of the present value of expenditure expected to be incurred by the Group and Company in order to restore its leasehold premises to the condition required under the individual lease agreements at the end of their term.
Legal penalty In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT adjudicated JJB to be guilty of price-fixing of certain replica kit products over a two year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a penalty of 8.4 million.
JJB appealed to the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT against the OFTs decision on liability and against the level of the penalty itself.
The result of the appeal against the decision of the OFT on liability, although given mainly in favour of the OFT, included some elements that were found in JJBs favour.
The decision of the CAT in the appeal against the level of the penalty which was announced in May 2005 was to reduce the penalty to 6.7 million.
Acknowledging this decision, and based on legal advice, JJB had made a charge of 2 million in respect of the penalty in its Consolidated income statement for the 53 weeks to 30 January 2005.
JJB was disappointed in parts of the CATs judgement on liability and the consequent amount of the reduction in its penalty.
In consultation with its legal advisers, JJB determined the specific grounds on which it wished to appeal to a higher court.
On the basis of further legal advice regarding the appeal to the Court of Appeal, acknowledging the specific grounds on which the appeal was to be heard together with the inherent uncertainty of the appeal process, JJB made a further charge in respect of the penalty of 1.9 million in its Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 29 January 2006.
On 19 October 2006, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgement dismissing JJBs appeal against the OFTs and CATs findings that JJB had infringed the Competition Act 1998.
JJBs subsequent application for leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the House of Lords itself.
Having exhausted its right to appeal, JJB paid the penalty and interest, amounting to 7.9 million to the OFT on 26 February 2007.
In acknowledgement of this liability, JJB has made a further charge in respect of the penalty and the interest thereon of 4,063,000 in its Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007.
On 5 March 2007, The Consumers Association lodged a representative action for damages against JJB at the CAT.
The action is brought on behalf of consumers for losses suffered by purchasing certain replica shirts in 2000 and 2001.
JJB subsequently made an offer to give a free England shirt and mug to anyone who presented one of these old replica shirts in its stores.
The cost of this free offer and a provision for future legal costs has been expensed by JJB in its Consolidated income statement for the 52 weeks to 28 January 2007.

Financial instruments continued b Financial risks and policies Set out below is a summary of the main financial risks faced by the Group during the accounting period and the policies employed to address these risks.
These policies have been applied consistently throughout the accounting period.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and funding requirements centrally with the objective of maximising interest income and minimising interest expense.
Investments of cash surpluses are made with banks which must satisfy credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board of Directors.
The Groups policy throughout the accounting period has been to use the revolving bank credit facility together with retained profits, to achieve continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
In addition, the Group obtained a Term loan in June 2006 to finance the acquisition of the Glasgow Rangers FC licensing agreement.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through the revolving bank credit facility, the Term loan and its retained profits.
Floating rates of interest are charged on the bank facility and Term loan.
No interest rate hedging agreement is currently in place because given the level of borrowings and the current interest rate environment, the Board does not consider fluctuations in interest rates to pose a significant risk to the Group.
Foreign currency risk The Groups treasury department tracks the sterling dollar exchange rate on a continuous basis in order to minimise and protect the Groups risk to currency fluctuations.
The majority of the Groups trading activities are conducted with United Kingdom suppliers and customers, the transactions being payable and receivable in sterling: only approximately 34 million of the Groups annualised purchases are settled in US dollars.
In November 2005 and January 2006, the Group entered into a series of forward contracts which covered its dollar requirements through to May 2006, at a fixed rate of exchange.
These contracts matured in February, April and May 2006 and protected the Groups trading position and Balance sheet from significant exchange rate movements.
In August 2006 the Group entered into a further series of forward contracts which covered its dollar requirements through to December 2007. c Financial assets Group 28 January 29 January 2007 2006 000 000 Current asset investment 168,117 168,117 Cash and cash equivalents 23,566 34,860 191,683 202,977 The currency profile of financial assets was: Group 28 January 29 January 2007 2006 000 000 Sterling 184,192 198,929 Dollar 1,968 2,404 Euro 5,523 1,644 191,683 202,977 Financial assets comprise short-term cash deposits with major United Kingdom and European clearing banks and earn floating rates of interest based upon bank base rates or at rates linked to LIBOR.
