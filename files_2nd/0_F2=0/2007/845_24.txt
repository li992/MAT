Notes to the company balance sheet 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Cash flow statement The company is exempt from the requirement of FRS 1 Cash flow statements to prepare a cash flow statement as its cash flows are included within the consolidated cash flow of the group.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment mainly three to five years Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instruments.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as described in note 1 to the consolidated accounts.
The company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures as the financial instruments disclosures of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: disclosure are included in the notes to the consolidated accounts.
Financial guarantee contracts Where the company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the group, the company considers these to be indemnity arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect the company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward exchange contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Interest Interest income and payable is recognised in profit or loss on an accruals basis using the effective interest method.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pensions Contributions to defined benefit pension schemes in respect of employees of AMEC plc are charged in the profit and loss account as incurred.
Defined benefit pension schemes are operated by the group but the company is unable to separately identify its share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes or any details of the surplus or deficit in the scheme and the implications of that surplus or deficit for the company.
Details of the disclosures required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits can be found in the accounts of AMEC Group Limited, a subsidiary company.
Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares: these awards are granted by AMEC.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred tax.
