As set out in note 29, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes including within the US.
The Group has applied to the IRS to correct a number of errors that had inadvertently been made in the operation of part of the US schemes, in order to preserve their favourable tax treatment.
At this stage it is not practicable to estimate whether or not this will result in a cost to the Company.
The annual contributions to the schemes by the Group are 4.7m 2006: 5.2m.
The Groups subsidiaries and the Company can be parties to legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Groups financial position.
