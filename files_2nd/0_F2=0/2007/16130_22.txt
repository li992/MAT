The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the cash-generating units relating to the Midlands and the South by 150.0 million 2006: 250.0 million before tax.
Net of tax, the impairment reduced the carrying value by 108.0 million 2006: 175.0 million.
The current period impairment charge was based on comparing carrying value with fair value less costs to sell as these cash-generating units were for sale during the year.
The review at the current period-end confirmed the impairment charge and was based on comparing the carrying value with value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The prior period impairment charge was based on comparing the carrying value with value in use and fair value less costs to sell.

Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units.
The carrying value of goodwill analysed by business segment is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Regionals 71.7 58.9 Nationals 2.2 2.2 73.9 61.1 The Regionals division comprises eight cash-generating units.
Prior to the disposal of the Sports business, the Nationals and Sports segments were combined as a single cash-generating unit.
None of the goodwill related to the Sports division.
The Group tests the carrying value of goodwill at the cash-generating unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
At the period-end reporting date, a review was undertaken on a value-in-use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from those assets, using cash flow projections in respect of periods to 2058 for goodwill relating to print businesses and to 2012 for goodwill relating to online businesses discounted at 7.34% 2006: 7.52% reflecting a long-term equity and debt mix based on the year-end Enterprise Value assuming a long-term debt to EBITDA ratio of three times.
The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of capital expenditure required during the period.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets and projections for 2009 to 2012.
The cash flow forecasts reflect past experience of and the risk associated with each asset.
Cash flows beyond 2012 are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for the relevant markets.
Investment cash flows have been forecast to reflect the cycle of capital investment required, including printing press replacement.
Management believes it is appropriate to forecast for a period of greater than five years for print businesses to most appropriately reflect the length of the capital investment cycle.

The Group tests the carrying value of publishing rights and titles with indefinite economic lives at the cash-generating unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that publishing rights and titles might be impaired.
The directors consider publishing rights and titles have indefinite economic lives due to the historic longevity of the brands and the ability to evolve the brands in the ever changing media landscape.
It is not practicable to review individual publishing rights and titles due to the interdependencies of the inflows within the cash-generating units.
The impairment review of the carrying value of the Groups publishing rights and titles performed at the interim reporting date indicated that an impairment charge was required in respect of the cash-generating units of the regional businesses in the Midlands and the South 2006: same.
The impairment charge was based on fair value less cost to sell as these assets were held for sale at the interim reporting date.
The impairment charge reduced the carrying value of the publishing rights and titles of the cash-generating unit relating to the Midlands by 85.0 million and the South by 65.0 million respectively 2006: 175.0 million and 75.0 million respectively before tax.
Net of tax, the impairment reduced the carrying value of the publishing rights and titles by 108.0 million 2006: 175.0 million.
The impairments have arisen due to declining profits in the respective cashgenerating units.
The customer relationships and domain names included above have finite estimated useful lives of between five and ten years and are tested at the cash-generating unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that customer relationships and domain names might be impaired.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 40 days 2006: 36 days.
No interest is charged on the receivables.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables over 120 days because historical experience is such that these receivables are generally not recoverable.
Trade receivables between 60 days and 120 days are provided for based on specific circumstances and by reference to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group, where appropriate, uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
Limits attributed to customers are reviewed during the year where appropriate.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% 2006: 10% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 3.5 million 2006: 5.9 million which are past due date at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
There are no significant amounts included in the allowance for doubtful debts relating to impaired trade receivables which have been placed under liquidation.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.

The movement in the number of shares under option during the period was: 2007 2006 Options outstanding at start of period 2,718,163 Granted during the period 2,917,754 Exercised during the period 7,896 1,101 Lapsed during the period 473,615 198,490 Awards outstanding at end of period 2,236,652 2,718,163 The weighted average share price for the options lapsed during the year was 455.9 pence 2006: 476.4 pence.
The weighted average share price for the options exercised during the year was 493.9 pence 2006: 488.1 pence.
The Group recognised a charge of 2.9 million 2006: credit of 1.8 million related to share-based payments during the period.
In 2006, the credit of 1.8 million represents a charge of 2.4 million in respect of the awards made in 2006 and a release of 4.2 million in respect of awards made in 2004 and 2005 due to adjustment for non-market-based factors.
36 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Defined benefit pension schemes The Group operates 10 defined benefit pension schemes for certain employees which were closed to new employees with effect from 1 January 2003.
All new employees are entitled to participate in a defined contribution plan, the Trinity Mirror Pension Plan.
Following the disposals completed in 2007, agreement was reached with the Trustees to make payments totalling 107.5 million into the final salary pension schemes in addition to the deficit payments already made in the period.
On 20 December 2007, 37.5 million and on 24 December 2007 a further 16.2 million was paid into the schemes with the balance of 53.8 million paid on 4 January 2008.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees, who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
These schemes have formal actuarial valuations carried out regularly.
The actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate their assets and liabilities vary according to actuarial and funding policies adjusted by the Trustees.
The last formal valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2004 and showed that they have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benefits.
During 2007, 34.0 million was paid into the Past Service Scheme 2006: 12.5 million.
As part of the payment on 4 January 2008, a further 21.5 million was paid into the scheme.
For 2008, agreement has been reached with the Trustees to pay a further 9.5 million into the scheme.
The next full actuarial valuation of the scheme is currently being prepared.
Formal valuations of the other eight final salary schemes are carried out regularly, with the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective Trustees.
The most significant of the schemes are the Trinity Retirement Benefit Scheme the Trinity Scheme, Midland Independent Newspapers Pension Scheme the MIN Scheme and the MGN Pension Scheme the MGN Scheme, which together with the Old Scheme and the Past Service Scheme represent over 97% of the aggregate market value.
The last formal valuation of these schemes was undertaken on 30 June 2006 for the Trinity Scheme, 31 March 2004 for the MIN Scheme and 31 December 2004 for the MGN Scheme.
These valuations showed deficits of 23.3 million, 30.8 million and 55.9 million respectively.
All of the schemes are being funded in accordance with the recommendations of the respective actuaries.
Deficit payments during 2007 were 8.5 million 2006: 2.5 million, 13.5 million 2006: 4.5 million and 23.0 million 2006: 7.0 million respectively.
As part of the payment on 4 January 2008, 3.5 million, 9.0 million and 16.0 million respectively was paid into these schemes.
For 2008, agreement has been reached with the Trustees to pay 2.2 million, 2.5 million and 4.0 million respectively into these schemes.
In addition during 2007, section 75 payments were made into the MIN Scheme and MGN Scheme of 2.2 million and 1.0 million respectively.
The employers contribution rate to the Trinity Scheme remained at 14% during the period and it has been agreed with the Trustees that this will increase to 15% in 2008.
The employers contribution rate to the MIN Scheme remained at 15% during the period.
The employers contribution rate to the MGN Scheme remained at 12% during the period.
The next full actuarial valuations for the MIN Scheme and the MGN Schemes are currently being prepared.
Valuations have been performed in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19 with scheme liabilities calculated using a consistent projected unit valuation method and compared to the market value of the schemes assets at 30 December 2007.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 28, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising share capital and reserves as disclosed in note 31. gearing ratio The Board reviews the capital structure, including the level of gearing and interest cover, as required.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Groups net debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.1 at the year end and is expected to increase during 2008 as a result of the share buy-back.
The Groups interest cover for 2007 was 5.9 and the minimum cover permitted under the Groups financing facilities is 3.25.
The gearing ratio and interest cover at the reporting date were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Debt 460.1 473.7 Cash and cash equivalents 211.6 32.8 Net debt 248.5 440.9 EBITDA 235.1 259.6 Net debt to EBITDA 1.1 1.7 Operating profit 208.9 217.8 Interest 35.4 31.8 Interest cover 5.9 6.8 Debt is defined as longand short-term borrowings.
EBITDA includes continuing and discontinued operations and is stated after non-recurring items, with the exception of the impairment of intangible assets.

Externally imposed capital requirement The Group is subject to externally imposed capital requirements based on net worth covenants under the US dollar and sterling private placement loan notes and the 269 million syndicated bank facility.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 3.
Categories of financial instruments The Groups significant financial assets are cash, trade and other receivables which are classified as loans and receivables and are accordingly held at amortised cost.
The Groups derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.
Trade and other payables, bank overdrafts and loan notes are all designated as other financial liabilities and held at amortised cost.
Financial risk management objectives The Groups Treasury function provides services to the business, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through regular meetings with the Group Finance Director analysing exposures by degree and magnitude of risk.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instruments where appropriate to hedge these exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a continuous basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The corporate Treasury function provides a monthly report to the Board covering compliance with covenants and other treasury-related matters.
TriniTy Mirror plc AnnuAl reporT & AccounTs 2007 88 ACCOUNTS AND NOTES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has entered into specific derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk in respect of its private placements as set out in note 29.
Foreign currency risk management The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
Hence, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts where appropriate.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Liabilities Assets 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Euro 3.8 3.1 US dollar 309.3 314.3 342.1 341.7 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to the Euro and US dollar.
The Euro exposure arises on sales of newspapers in Europe.
The Euro sales represent less than 2% of Group income.
The Euros are kept on deposit and used to fund Euro costs.
When Euros on deposit build to a target balance they are converted into sterling.
The Group does not hedge the Euro income or deposits because the risk of foreign exchange movements is not deemed to be significant.
The US dollar exposure arises on the Groups US private placement debt which is mainly US dollar denominated and fixed interest.
At the time of the private placement issue the Group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps to change the US dollar principal and US dollar fixed interest profile of the debt to sterling principal and sterling floating interest.
The timing of the swaps exactly match every private placement interest and principle payment due.
As a result the Group is not subject to any US dollar foreign exchange exposure on its private placement and matching swaps.
The Groups balance sheet shows the US private placement converted to sterling at the balance sheet date currency rate.
The matching swaps are carried at fair value which represents the value of the fixed to floating swap, the currency element of the interest payments due and the currency element of the principle payments.
The difference between the valuation approaches gives rise to a charge or credit to the income statement.
The following tables detail the Groups sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling rate against the Euro and US dollar in both years.
A 10% movement in exchange rates based on the level of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items including external loans.

During the current and prior period no contracts were entered into.
Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through interest rate cycles.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on the financial assets and liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
TriniTy Mirror plc AnnuAl reporT & AccounTs 2007 89 ACCOUNTS AND NOTES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the reporting date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared using the Groups monthly cash forecasting model.
A 2% increase in interest rates has been used and represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change.
If interest rates had been 2% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 30 December 2007 would decrease increase by 4.6 million 2006: decrease increase by 5.8 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates is unchanged from the prior period.
Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using yield curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The Group entered into one contract in the period 2006: none which was settled by the balance sheet date.
There were no outstanding balances at the end of the period.
Other price risks The Group has no equity investments and is not directly exposed to equity price risk.
The Group does not actively trade these investments.
The Group has indirect exposure through its defined benefit pension schemes.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties.
The Group only transacts with financial institutions that are rated the equivalent to investment grade and above.
This information is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not, the Group uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rate its major customers.
The Groups exposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are reviewed by the Board at appropriate times and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved counterparties.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers and spread across diverse sectors.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of trade receivables.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar characteristics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are connected entities.
Concentration of credit risk with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Standard and Poor.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The table below shows the internal credit limit and amount on deposit with the Groups major counterparties at the reporting date using the Standard and Poor credit-rating symbols: 2007 2006 Counterparty Credit limit Deposit Credit limit Deposit Location Rating m m m m National Westminster Bank plc London AA 75.0 50.7 75.0 8.5 HSBC Bank plc London AA 75.0 50.3 75.0 Lloyds TSB Bank plc London AA 75.0 50.0 75.0 Barclays Bank plc London AA 75.0 50.0 75.0 The Group has provided a bank guarantee for 9.5 million, to the finance lessor of the Newcastle presses.

TriniTy Mirror plc AnnuAl reporT & AccounTs 2007 90 ACCOUNTS AND NOTES NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 37 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk results from having insufficient financial resources to meet day-to-day fluctuations in working capital and cashflow.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 28 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Liquidity risk and interest risk tables The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
