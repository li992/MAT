113 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 17 Share-based payment continued The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 862.5p 2006: between 398p and 862.5p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: Exercise price p 2007 2006 350650 3,191 8,679 650950 48,940 484,444 9501250 52,131 493,123 The options have a weighted average contractual life of two years 2006: four years.
Options were exercised throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 1144p 2006: 919p.
The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options with nil exercise price 2007 2006 Risk free interest rate Expected volatility 19.0% 19.0% Peer group volatility 25.7%25.9% 29.7%31.2% Expected option life in years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 2.7%2.8% 3.4%-3.5% Weighted average share price 1236p1295p 931p1033p Weighted average exercise price 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 684p1194p 369p934p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2006: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
