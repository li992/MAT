Defined benefit plan The Group operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested in managed funds units.
The contributions are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The most recent actuarial valuation completed, using the projected unit method, was as at 5 April 2007.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments pre retirement, the rates of increase in salaries and the post retirement investment return.
The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 100.7m and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 98% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The scheme has been closed to new joiners for pension benefits since 1 April 2000.
