Pension contributions are determined based on the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Formal valuations of the Capita scheme and the FPS scheme were carried out as at 6 April 2005 and 31 March 2005 respectively.
For the other schemes, the latest formal valuations were carried out as at either 1 April 2004, 31 December 2006 or 31 March 2007.
These valuations are updated by qualified independent actuaries at each balance sheet date.
Scheme assets are stated at their market valuations at each respective balance sheet date.
The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on assets has been derived by considering the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.

The Directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 77.8m of which an IFRS transitional adjustment of 67.7m was taken directly to equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2004.
