Significant accounting policies continued Goodwill and intangible asset impairments The Group supplies a number of products and services some of which arise from internal development expenditure or through the acquisition of specific businesses.
Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash flows to appropriate cash-generating units CGUs, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation.
Subsequent changes to the CGU allocation or to the timing of asset cash flows could impact the respective assets.
Taxation The Groups operations have wide geographic coverage, resulting in differing taxation regimes depending on the location in which those activities take place.
The effective rate reflects this broad geographic spread of profits, irrecoverable losses in certain territories, a variety of imputed and higher rate overseas tax regimes and non-deductible items.
Accounting provision must be made for taxation liabilities before tax returns are filed, and review or audit of these returns by the local taxation authorities can take place several years later.
Management makes provision for taxation liabilities on what it believes to be a fair and reasonable calculation of the probable liability, which includes recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities on temporary differences between accounting and taxable profit.
Changes in the underlying assumptions regarding the reversal of these differences, or in the tax regime where the differences arise, could result in significant changes in the carrying value of tax assets or liabilities.
