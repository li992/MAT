The adjustment for share-based payment relates to the transitional impact of the accounting standard for share based compensation.
The annual bonus is paid in a mixture of cash and deferred shares and the proportions can vary from one year to another.
Under IFRS the deferred share element is amortised to the income statement over the vesting period whilst the cash element is expensed in the year.
The adjustment above addresses this by deducting from profit the difference between the IFRS 2 charge and the value of the annual share award.
The gross amounts of the above adjustments are profits on disposals 0.7m 2006 5.1m, share-based payment adjustment 4.8m 2006 6.1m and add back of amortisation of intangibles excluding software and impairment of goodwill and available-for-sale investments of 5.1m 2006 1.8m.
