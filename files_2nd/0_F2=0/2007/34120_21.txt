Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2007 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual outcomes may therefore differ from these estimates and assumptions.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
a Estimate of Fair Value of Investment Properties The Group values its self storage centres using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Development Property The Groups development properties are held in the balance sheet at historic cost and are not valued externally.
In acquiring sites for redevelopment into self storage facilities, the Group estimates and makes judgements on the potential net lettable storage space that it can achieve in its planning negotiations, together with the time it will take to achieve maturity occupancy level.
In addition, assumptions are made on the storage rent that can be achieved at the store by comparing with other stores within the portfolio and within the local area.
These judgements taken together with estimates of operating costs and the projected construction cost, allow the Group to calculate the potential net operating income at maturity, projected returns on capital invested and hence to support the purchase price of the site at acquisition.
Following the acquisition, regular reviews are carried out taking into account the status of planning negotiations, revised construction costs or capacity of the new facility, for example, to make an assessment of the carrying value of the development property at historic cost.
Once a store is opened, then it is valued as an investment property in the Groups balance sheet and transferred from development properties.
The Group reviews all development property assets for impairment at each balance sheet date.
REVENUE Analysis of the Groups operating revenue and costs can be found below and in the Portfolio Summary on page 20.
