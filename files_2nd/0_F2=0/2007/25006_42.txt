Financial statements ICAP plc 91 Annual Report 2007 23 Financial instruments Risk management The Group operates internationally and, in addition to operational risk, is exposed to a variety of financial risks including liquidity, interest rate, currency and credit risk.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by using derivative instruments to lower funding costs, alter interest rate exposures arising as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
The use of derivatives forms part of the Groups overall risk management framework as determined by the board through the group risk and group finance committees.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge actual or anticipated transactions which arise in the normal course of business and which are viewed by the Group as highly probable to occur.
The terms of the hedging instruments are designed to match the terms of the underlying hedged transactions and, where possible, to achieve hedge accounting under IAS39.
Liquidity risk The Group seeks to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and funding to enable it to fund its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost effective and attractive terms.
Interest rate risk The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages from time to time with a combination of interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps.
The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups income statement.
Currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies principally the US dollar and euro.
Consequently, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenues and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its overseas operations.
a Transactional exposures The Group seeks to manage its US dollar and euro transactional exposure by hedging forecast exposures for up to two years forward using forward foreign exchange contracts and options.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposures is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and 25% thereafter.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in equity to the extent it is highly effective and recycled to the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS39.
The Groups other transactional exposures are continually monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of 12 months forward.
Exposures are reviewed monthly with hedging actions approved by the finance committee.
b Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local balance sheet may contain assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation on the retranslation of the balance sheet of foreign operations into sterling, the Groups reporting currency.
These exposures are viewed as short-term in nature and, as such, the Groups policy is not to actively manage these exposures.
c Earnings translation exposures The Group does not hedge the translation of those profits or losses earned by its overseas operations.
Financial statements ICAP plc 92 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its agency, matched principal and corporate treasury operations.
The risk in respect of the agency business is limited to the collection of agency commission and is controlled by the establishment and monitoring of credit limits for individual clients.
The exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable.
Concentration is limited since the customer base is both large and unrelated.
No significant concentrations of risk existed at the year end.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which may involve one or more financial instruments and or counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk in respect of these transactions by having policies and procedures in place to ensure that the risks inherent in all trades are matched and that appropriate credit limits have been set and are monitored at entity, parent and country level to restrict the exposure to potential loss.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for the Group is represented by the total fair value of the financial assets.
There were no significant concentrations of risk at the year end.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited by the Groups policy of requiring its corporate treasury transactions to be undertaken with financial institutions which have been approved by the group risk committee and which are investment grade rated by one or more recognised credit rating agencies.
The Groups approach to managing financial risk is also described in the business review on pages 22 to 26. i Fair value of assets and liabilities The book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are presented in the table below.

Gains and losses on revaluation are recognised directly in equity to offset the revaluation of the net investment.
During the year the Group entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge a deferred liability arising from the acquisition of Reset.
The Group has designated these contracts as fair value hedging instruments against the liability, with gains or losses on revaluation being recognised in the income statement to offset the revaluation of the liability.
As at 31 March 2007 the hedging instruments had a fair value of 0.2m.

It shows the net monetary assets and liabilities held by Group companies that were not denominated in their functional currencies other than certain foreign currency borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations that were unhedged and therefore may give rise to exchange gains and losses that would flow through to the Groups income statement.
