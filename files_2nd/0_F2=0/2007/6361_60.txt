84 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Financial risk continued Counterparty credit risk The groups strategy for credit risk management is to set minimum credit ratings for counterparties and monitor these on a regular basis.
For treasury-related transactions, the policy limits the aggregate credit risk assigned to a counterparty.
The utilisation of a credit limit is calculated by applying a weighting to the notional value of each transaction outstanding with each counterparty based on the type and duration of the transaction.
For short-term transactions under one year, the financial counterparty must be investment grade rated by either the Standard & Poors or Moodys rating agency.
For long-term transactions, the financial counterparty must have a minimum rating of A A1 from Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Treasury transactions are dealt with the groups relationship banks all of which have a strong investment grade rating.
At 31 December 2007 the largest two counterparty exposures related to Treasury transactions were 5.3m and 4.4m and held with institutions with long term Standard & Poors credit ratings of AA and AArespectively.
These exposures represent 30% and 25% of the carrying values of derivative financial instruments with a fair value gain at the balance sheet date.
The group operates a multi-currency notional pooling cash management system with a wholly owned subsidiary of an AA rated bank.
At year end credit balances of 84.5m were pooled with debit balances of 82.9m, resulting in a net pool balance of 1.6m.
There is legal right of set off under the pooling agreement.
At an operating level the minimum investment grade rating criteria applies.
Exceptionally, where required by local country circumstances, counterparties with no, or a non-investment grade, rating can be approved as counterparties for a period of up to 12 months.
Due to the groups global geographical footprint and exposure to multiple industries, there is minimal concentration risk.
34 Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a wide range of retirement benefit arrangements which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
These include funded defined contribution and funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution arrangements The majority of the retirement benefit arrangements operated by the group are of a defined contribution structure, where the employer contribution and resulting income statement charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and charged to the income statement totalled 57.9m 2006: 49.8m.
In the UK, following the closure of the defined benefit schemes to new entrants, the main scheme for new employees is a contracted-in defined contribution scheme.
Wackenhut Services, Inc WSI is the administrator of several defined benefit schemes.
WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defined benefit schemes as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.
Therefore, these schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
In the Netherlands, most employees are members of industry-wide defined benefit schemes which are not valued on an IAS 19 basis as it is not possible to identify separately the groups share of the schemes assets and liabilities.
As a result the schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
Contributions made to the schemes and charged to the income statement in 2007 totalled 4.7m 2006: 4.2m.
The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the schemes during the financial year commencing 1 January 2008 in respect of the ongoing accrual of benefits is approximately 4.9m.
Defined benefit arrangements The group operates a number of defined benefit retirement arrangements where the benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Liabilities under these arrangements are stated at the discounted value of benefits accrued to date, based upon actuarial advice.
Under unfunded arrangements, the group does not hold the related assets separate from the group.
The amount charged to the income statement in respect of these arrangements in 2007 totalled 1.8m 2006: 1.6m.
Under funded arrangements, the assets of defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The group operates several funded defined retirement benefit schemes.
Whilst the groups primary schemes are in the UK, it also operates other material schemes in the Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and Israel.
During 2007, two defined benefit schemes one in the Netherlands and one in Israel have been reclassified, for disclosure purposes, into the material funded defined retirement benefit schemes category.

They comprise two arrangements: the pension scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S with total membership of approximately 8,000 and the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, with total membership of approximately 20,000.
Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2007 in respect of the Group 4 scheme and at 5 April 2006 in respect of the Securicor scheme.
Pension obligations stated in the balance sheet take account of future service and earnings increases, have been updated to 31 December 2007 and use the valuation methodologies specified in IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The weighted average principal assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuations were as follows: UK Rest of World Key assumptions used 2007 Discount rate 5.8% 5.5% Expected return on scheme assets 6.7% 5.8% Expected rate of salary increases 5.2% 3.3% Future pension increases 3.4% 2.1% Inflation 3.4% 2.2% Key assumptions used 2006 Discount rate 5.2% 4.8% Expected return on scheme assets 6.5% 5.8% Expected rate of salary increases 4.9% 3.7% Future pension increases 3.1% 2.3% Inflation 3.1% 2.3% In addition to the above, the group uses appropriate mortality assumptions when calculating the schemes obligations.
