The Group seeks to minimise the risk or sudden and unexpected rises in finance costs by way of financial derivative instruments while retaining the ability to take advantage of falling interest rates.
Foreign exchange risk The Group holds property and related borrowings in US Dollars.
Consequently the Group has a degree of exposure to foreign currency risk.
As the Groups investments in the US are held for the long term and funds are not usually returned to the UK the Groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency transactions.
Instead management monitor exchange rates on a regular basis and elect to transfer funds between the UK and the US only when the rate is favourable to do so.
Credit risk Management monitors credit risk on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed and security deposits taken from new residential and commercial tenants.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments in the balance sheet.

The weighted average interest rate on these mortgages was 6.64% 2006 6.71% and the weighted average period for which the borrowing is xed at 31 March 2007 was 10 years 2006 9 years.
