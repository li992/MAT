Goodwill m Cost At 1 January 2006 122.1 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 104.0 Exchange differences 14.0 At 31 December 2006 212.1 At 1 January 2007 212.1 Recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries 12.0 Exchange differences 1.1 At 31 December 2007 223.0 Net book value At 1 January 2007 212.1 At 31 December 2007 223.0 Cash-generating units, comprising individual business centres, are grouped by country of operation for the purpose of carrying out impairment reviews of non-current assets as this is the lowest level at which goodwill can be assessed.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations is held at a country level and is subject to impairment reviews based on the cash flows of these cash-generating units.
The goodwill attributable to the reportable business segments is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Americas business segment 123.6 115.4 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the EMEA business segment 3.1 1.8 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the Asia Pacific business segment 7.7 7.3 Carrying amount of goodwill included within the UK business segment 88.6 87.6 223.0 212.1 Specific groups of cash-generating units for which the carrying amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets is significant are as follows: Goodwill Intangible assets 2007 2006 m m m m USA 112.9 112.9 109.2 UK 88.6 11.2 99.8 98.8 The recoverable amount of each of the groups of cash-generating units above has been determined based on their value in use, calculated as the present value of future cash ows attributable to the group.
The following key assumptions have been used in calculating value in use for each group of cash-generating units: future cash ows are based on budgets for 2008 approved by the Board.
Thereafter a prudent growth rate not exceeding 3% has been applied to revenues for the first five years, with 0% growth thereafter which does not exceed the long term average growth rate for a similar business.
a terminal value is included in the assessment reecting the Groups expectation that it will continue to operate in these markets.
a country specic pre-tax discount rate has been applied to future cash ows for each cash-generating unit, based on an underlying post-tax discount rate of 12%, grossed up by the applicable tax rate in each country.
The pre-tax rate reects current market assessments and the risks specic to such businesses in each country.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to changes in the expected level of long-term profitability and the discount rate applied to the future cash ows.
The trading conditions in which the Group operates is subject to competitive and economic pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Foreseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections of a significant nature so as to result in a cash-generating units carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
A fall of more than 12% in the future cash ows would be required to result in the carrying amount exceeding the recoverable amount.
There is no goodwill relating to the Groups joint ventures.
Regus Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 59 Financial Statements Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued 13.
The Regus brand acquired in this transaction is assumed to have an indefinite useful life due to the fact that the value of the brand is intrinsically linked to the continuing operation of the Group.
As a result of the Regus brand acquired with the UK business having an indefinite useful life no amortisation is charged but the carrying value is assessed for impairment on an annual basis.
The brand was tested at 31 October 2007 against the recoverable amount of the UK business segment at the same time as the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the UK business see note 12.

Financial instruments and financial risk management The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments and the management of capital are determined at Group level.
The Groups Board maintains overall responsibility for the risk management strategy of the Group and the Chief Financial officer is responsible for policy on a day to day basis.
The Chief Financial officer and Group Treasurer review the Groups risk management strategy and policies on an ongoing basis.
The Board has delegated to the Group Audit Committee the responsibility for applying an effective system of internal control and compliance with the Groups risk management policies.
The Audit Committee is supported by the Head of Risk Management in performing this role.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of business.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
Credit risk Credit risk could occur where a customer or counterparty defaults under the contractual terms of a financial instrument and arises principally in relation to customer contracts and the Groups cash deposits.
A diversied customer base and requirement for customer deposits and payments in advance on workstation contracts which contribute the majority of the Groups revenue minimises the Groups exposure to customer credit risk.
No single customer contributes a material percentage of the Groups revenue.
The Groups policy is to provide against trade receivables when specic debts are judged to be irrecoverable or where formal recovery procedures have commenced.
A provision is created where debts are more than three months overdue which reflects the Groups historical experience of the likelihood of recoverability of these trade receivables.
These provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assess changes in the likelihood of recoverability.
Cash assets and derivative financial instruments are only transacted with counterparties of sound credit ratings, and management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date, analysed by geographic region is summarised below.
2007 2006 m m Americas 19.9 18.8 EMEA 33.0 25.5 UK 22.0 19.7 Asia Pacic 11.5 7.2 86.4 71.2 All of the Groups trade receivables relate to customers purchasing workplace solutions and no individual customer has a material balance owing as a trade receivable.
The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was Gross Provision Gross Provision 2007 2007 2006 2006 m m m m Not overdue 71.9 0.1 59.4 0.1 Past due 030 days 10.2 8.5 Past due 3160 days 3.4 2.8 More than 60 days 4.6 3.6 3.8 3.2 90.1 3.7 74.5 3.3 During the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group provided for an additional 3.1 million against potential bad debts 2006: 1.9 million and utilised 2.8 million directly against the balance of trade receivables 2006: 2.2 million.
The Group believes no provision is generally required for trade receivables that are not overdue as the Group collects the majority of its revenue in advance of the provision of ofce services and requires deposits from its customers.
com Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by reviewing its global cash position on a weekly basis and expects to have sufficient liquidity to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
In addition to free cash excluding blocked cash of 128.5 million 2006: 63.8 million the Group has a senior committed facility of 136 million.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Groups debt is held at variable interest rates because further early repayment of the debt is probable.
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
Whenever possible, and subject to the operational requirements of the Group, cash is repatriated to the parent company and managed by the Group Treasury department.
Foreign currency risk The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in Pounds Sterling, US dollars and euros.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the income statement.
The Groups investments in subsidiaries are generally not hedged as these currency positions are considered to be long term in nature.
Derivative financial instruments Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate uctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
At 31 December 2007 there were no derivative financial instruments outstanding 2006: None No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Other market risks The Group does not hold any available-for-sale equity securities and is therefore not subject to risks of changes in equity prices.
Capital management The Groups parent company is listed on the UK stock exchange and the Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base.
The Chief Financial officer monitors the diversity of the Groups major shareholders and further details on the Groups communication with key investors can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 28 to 34.
In 2006, the Board approved the commencement of a progressive dividend policy to enhance the total return to shareholders.
The Groups Chief Executive officer, Mark Dixon, is indirectly the major shareholder of the Company and all members of the Board hold shares in the Company.
Details of the Directors shareholdings can be found in the report of the Remuneration Committee on pages 35 to 41.
In addition, the Group operates various share option plans for key management and other senior employees.
At the 2007 Annual General Meeting shareholders approved a resolution for the Group to re-purchase up to 10% of its issued share capital in the market.
In June 2007, the Group commenced a share buyback programme to meet both the need to issue shares under the Groups share option programme and, more generally, as a means of returning cash to shareholders.
In the year ended 31 December 2007, 12,853,001 shares were repurchased in the market and 905,299 were used to satisfy obligations under the share option programme.
No shares were repurchased in 2006.
The Group purchased a further 22,025,000 of its own shares between 31 December 2007 and 14 March 2008.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group commenced a share buyback programme during the year ended 31 December 2007 and declared a final dividend for 2007 of 1.0p per share, 66.7% higher than 2006 0.6p per share.
There were no other changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
The Groups objective when managing capital equity and borrowings is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The Board balances the higher returns possible with higher levels of borrowings with the stability and security afforded by a sound capital position.
The Groups return on capital employed for the year ended 31 December 2007, dened as operating profit divided by total shareholders equity, was 39.6% 2006: 36.6%.
This compares to a weighted average interest rate on the principal Group secured nancing of 7.4% 2006: 7.0%.

Finance lease liabilities The fair value of finance leases has been calculated by discounting future cash ows at an appropriate discount rate which reects current market assessments and the risks specic to such liabilities.
Loans and overdrafts The fair value of bank loans, overdrafts and other loans approximates to the carrying value because interest rates are at oating rates where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

It is recognised by the Remuneration Committee that the additional EPS targets represent a highly challenging goal and consequently in determining whether they have been met the Committee will exercise its discretion.
The overall aim is that the relevant EPS targets must have been met on a run rate or underlying basis.
As such an adjusted measure of EPS will be calculated designed to assess the underlying performance of the business.
While the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to adjust EPS as it sees t at the time, by way of example, the following adjustments are currently anticipated: In a growth company such as Regus, costs are necessarily incurred in one year to drive profits in future years.
As such it is important to ensure management is not incentivised to cut back on these investments to meet EPS targets in any one year.
Accordingly those costs, incurred in the vesting year, which it considers necessary to drive future growth will be excluded from the EPS calculation.
These would include, inter alia, the costs of the business development departments, excess marketing expenditures and current year losses from investing in new locations.
Any one-off or non-recurring costs will be excluded.
It is expected that in the period between 2006 and 2008 the cash tax rate will rise as cumulative tax losses are utilised thereby increasing progressively the challenge of achieving a 14p EPS target.
This will then be further complicated by the need to recognise deferred tax assets as the business strengthens reducing the accounting rate of tax in one year and increasing it in the next.
To provide greater clarity and incentive to management EPS will be calculated based upon the cash tax rate up to a maximum of 30%.
The Remuneration Committee is of the opinion that the EPS and free cash ow performance targets are a transparent and accurate measure of the Companys performance at this time and are the key corporate metrics for driving long term shareholder value.
In addition, the TSR condition will ensure that executives are encouraged to focus on ensuring that the Companys return to shareholders is competitive compared to comparable companies.
