c Under UK GAAP, the final dividend for the year was provided in the results for that year while under IFRS it is provided in the year that it is declared.
d In respect of the Reynolds American transaction in 2004, which combined the Groups US domestic business B&W with R. J. Reynolds: a 918 million unrecognised gain, included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in UK GAAP, is included in profit from operations under IFRS: and a write-back of 216 million under UK GAAP for goodwill previously written off to reserves, is not required under IFRS, which results in an additional gain on the partial disposal of B&W.
In addition, the gains and losses on the disposal of subsidiaries and fixed asset investments were shown below profit from operations under UK GAAP 185 million.
e The other adjustments principally reflect: provisions for deferred tax on the unremitted profit of associates and part of the unremitted profit of subsidiaries required under IFRS but not UK GAAP: the application of IFRS to the results of associates: and an additional gain on the partial disposal of B&W in 2004 of 128 million, as a result of the IFRS adjustments for B&W in respect of post-retirement benefits.
IAS32 and IAS39, which deal with financial instruments, were applied from 1 January 2005 and consequently the figures for 2004 and 2003 do not reflect the impact of those standards.
