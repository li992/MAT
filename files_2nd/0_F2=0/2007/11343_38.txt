EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes for its employees, the Northgate Information Solutions Pension Scheme the Northgate Scheme and the Rebus Group Pension Scheme the Rebus Scheme.
Benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service.
Assets are held in separate, trustee-administered funds.
Employer contributions to the schemes are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The schemes are closed to new employees who are instead eligible to join the defined contribution section of the Northgate Scheme or another defined contribution scheme.
As the schemes are closed to new entrants for pension accrual, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with IAS19, the cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase as the average age of the membership increases.
The accounting numbers are based on updated funding valuations carried out as at 31 March 2005 for the Northgate Scheme and 1 April 2005 for the Rebus Scheme and have been updated by Lane, Clarke Peacock to take account of the requirements of IAS19 to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes at 30 April 2007 and 30 April 2006.
The Group has adopted the revisions to IAS19 which were published in December 2004.
As permitted by the revised standard, actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the period in which they occur outside income and expense through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
Liability for defined benefit obligations The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date were: Northgate Rebus Northgate Rebus Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme 2007 2007 2006 2006 %% %% Discount rate at 30 April 5.3 5.3 5.2 5.2 Expected return on plan assets at 30 April 6.0 6.0 6.4 6.0 Future salary increases 3.0 3.0 2.9 2.9 Retail price inflation 3.0 3.0 2.9 2.9 Future pension increases 2.5% LPI 2.2 2.2 2.2 2.2 Future pension increases 5% LPI 3.0 3.0 2.9 2.9 The post-retirement mortality assumptions based on PA92 tables allow for future improvements in mortality.
The assumed life expectancy for a male active member reaching age 65 at the accounting date is 19.7 years 2006: 19.6.
Allowance has been made for further improvements to mortality, whereby the assumed life expectancy of a male member on reaching age 65 in 20 years time is 21.0 years 2006: 20.9.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued The expected rate of return on the pension plan assets is determined as the Groups best estimate of the long-term return of the major asset classes equities, bonds, gilts and cash weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
The expected rate of return is calculated using geometric averaging.
In addition to these contributions, the Board of Northgate has proposed a one-off contribution to Northgates current defined benefit scheme of 15.0 million.
This includes additional contributions aimed at removing the deficit of the Schemes over time.
There are additional contributions to the defined contribution scheme see below.

The options outstanding at 30 April 2007 have an exercise price in the range of 0.00 pence to 75.90 pence and a weighted average remaining life of 5.7 years 2006: 6.4 years.
Options with no minimum exercise price are subject to challenging earnings per share growth criteria.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value is measured based on either the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models.
The Monte Carlo model has been adopted for the Performance Share Option plan, introduced in January 2006, to incorporate market performance criteria not previously incorporated in the Black-Scholes valuation model.
Details of the fair value of share options granted in the period and the assumptions used in determining the fair value are summarised below based on a weighted average of grants in the year.
