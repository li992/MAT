Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2007 14.
VALUATIONS continued Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge representing 6% of the estimated annual revenue.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming straight line absorption from day one actual occupancy to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 43 stores both freeholds and leaseholds averages 86.06% 2006: 85.98%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
On average, for all 43 stores, the yield net of purchasers costs arising from the first year of the projected cash flow is 5.24% 2006: 6.01%.
This rises to 6.80% 2006: 7.49% based on the projected cash flow for the first year following estimated stabilisation in respect of each property.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 10.19% 2006: 10.59%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.75% 2006: 5.75% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 7.75% 2006: 7.75% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the groups leaseholds is 18.8 years March 2006: 19.8 years.
Change in valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.75% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
We believe therefore that the valuation assumptions should be adjusted to reflect the reality.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
We therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2007 of 615,950,000 25,890,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements or 21.9 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 000 000 Trade receivables 1,449 1,042 Other receivables 267 284 Prepayments and accrued income 5,266 4,683 6,982 6,009 Trade receivables are net of a bad debt provision of 53,000 2006: 4,000.
The Group does not offer credit terms to its customers and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
