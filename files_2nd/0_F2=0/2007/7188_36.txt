EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension plans During the year, the group operated a UK and Swiss defined benefit plan and defined contribution plans in the UK, France and the Netherlands.
The Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme is the principal defined benefit plan which provides benefits to group employees that have been admitted into the scheme.
The scheme is self-administered and its assets are held independently of the companys finances.
The scheme is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the company at rates advised by professionally qualified actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 using the projected unit method.
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary were, increase in salaries 4.5%, increase of pensions in payment 2.5%, discount rate before retirement 6.7%, discount rate after retirement 4.7% and inflation 2.5%.
Assets were taken at their audited market value at the valuation date.
The total group cost of operating the plans during the year was 3,164,000 2006: 3,075,000 and, at 31 December 2007, there was an amount of 423,000 2006: 319,000 owed to the plans, being employer and employee contributions due for December 2007 but not received by 31 December 2007.
Included within the total group cost are costs relating to the groups defined contribution plans.
The pension cost for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the plans and amounted to 1,361,000 2006: 1,307,000.
Contributions amounting to 95,000 2006: 88,000 were payable to the scheme at 31 December 2007.
In the UK there is no contractual agreement or stated group policy for allocating the net defined benefit liability between the participating subsidiaries and as such the full deficit is recognised by the company, which is the sponsoring employer.
The participating subsidiary companies have recognised a cost equal to contributions payable for the period as advised by a professionally qualified actuary.
The company recognises a cost equal to its contributions payable for the period net of amounts recharged in relation to the group deficit to the participating subsidiary companies.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED Share-based payments group and company Executive directors and executive management currently participate in executive share option schemes.
The option price may not be less than the greater of the mid-market value of the groups shares at the time when the options were granted or the nominal value.
Options granted under the 1998 Inland Revenue approved scheme are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of their date of grant, subject to the movement of the groups basic earnings per share exceeding RPI over the relevant period.
Options granted under the 1998 unapproved scheme are normally exercisable between the third and seventh anniversaries of their date of grant.
Awards are subject to the movement of the groups basic earnings per share exceeding RPI between 3% and 5% per annum over the relevant period.
Additionally, the group operates a savings related share option scheme sharesave scheme which is open to employees subject to eligibility criteria determined by the directors prior to each option grant.
The first grant under the current scheme was made on 28 October 2002 where employees with over one years service were invited to participate.
As this sharesave scheme was granted before 7 November 2002, the recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The most recent grant was on 25 May 2006 when employees with over one months service were invited to participate.
This sharesave scheme has been accounted for under IFRS 2.
