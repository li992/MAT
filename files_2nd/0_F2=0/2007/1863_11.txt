The 1.5 million goodwill on acquisitions in prior years arises as a result of the finalisation of fair value exercises.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2007 2006 m m Flight Support ASIG US 74.2 75.3 Signature US 109.5 92.3 Signature UK 13.7 16.5 Executive Beechcraft 19.2 Other several CGUs 25.0 20.7 Aftermarket Services & Systems Dallas Airmotive 40.1 40.7 H&S Aviation 10.7 10.7 Ontic Engineering & Manufacturing 21.1 21.3 Oxford Aviation Services 14.3 Other several CGUs 26.7 22.3 340.2 314.1 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an estimated growth rate of 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10.2%.
