30 Events after the Balance Sheet date On 21 March 2007, the UK Chancellor announced that the full rate of UK corporation tax would be reduced from 30% to 28% from April 2008.
However, this rate reduction has not been substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date and therefore as required by IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities as set out in note 12 relating to the UK have been measured at the currently enacted tax rate of 30%.
The deferred tax charge that will arise on substantive enactment of the proposed change to the corporation tax rate is not expected to have a material financial effect on the Groups effective tax rate for 2007 08.
