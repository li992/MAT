Financial instruments Treasury risk management policies The treasury risk management policies are set out in the Financial review, see page 42.
Capital management disclosures are also set out in the Financial review, on page 39. a Interest rate derivatives The Group uses a combination of short-term and long-term cross currency and interest rate swaps to manage the currency and interest rate profile of its borrowings.

qxd 3 3 08 18:32 Page 123 On swaps where fixed rates of interest are payable, the Group receives interest at floating rates of 3 months or 6 month LIBOR rates or local equivalent.
The differential to be paid or received on the current leg of swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognised within finance costs in the periods that they arise over the lives of the respective agreements.
The remaining cash flows to maturity of each swap are discounted at current market rates to determine the fair value of swap agreements at year-end.
b Embedded derivatives The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in IAS 39.
As at 31 December 2007, the fair value of embedded derivatives was an asset of 0.3 million 2006: 0.5 million.
This relates to foreign exchange forward contracts embedded within certain procurement contracts with maturities of between one and two years.
Amounts recorded in the income statement are included within those disclosed in Note 10 to the financial statements.
c Fair values and sensitivity analysis Fair values of non-derivative financial assets and liabilities: The fair values for public debt are based on quoted market prices.
For cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term loans and receivables with a maturity of less than one year the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
For non-public long-term loans and receivables, fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values using current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at year end.
The table below contains fair values of debt instruments based on clean prices excluding accrued interest.

Financial instruments continued The table below presents a sensitivity analysis of the changes in fair value which all impact the profit and loss of the Groups derivatives due to hypothetical changes in market rates.
The fair values are quoted market prices or, if not available, values estimated by discounting future cash flows to net present values.
The analysis below shows forward-looking projections of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur.
The sensitivity figures are calculated based on a downward parallel shift of 1% in yield curves and 10% weakening of sterling against other exchange rates.
An upward parallel shift of 1% in yield curves and 10% strengthening of sterling against other exchange rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on fair values to the table below.

The fair values of derivative instruments are based on the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay if the transaction was terminated.
Financial derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value being recognised immediately in the income statement.
For 2007 no derivatives were hedge accounted for.
