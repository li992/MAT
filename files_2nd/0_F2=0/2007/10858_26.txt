70 National Express Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued 8 Share-based payment continued The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had exercise prices that were between 398p and 1224p 2006: between 398p and 1224p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
Options were exercised regularly throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 1153p 2006: 911p.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options without Share options with nil exercise price nil exercise price 2007 2006 2007 2006 Risk free interest rate 5.0%5.2% 4.4%4.7% Expected volatility 27.0%27.3% 27.0%27.5% 19.0% 19.0% Peer group volatility 25.7%25.9% 29.7%31.2% Expected option life in years 6 years 6 years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.1% 3.6%3.8% 2.7%2.8% 3.4%3.5% Weighted average share price 1071p1175p 937p940p 1236p1295p 931p1033p Weighted average exercise price 1093p1153p 920p940p 0p 0p Weighted average fair value of options granted 215p262p 181p188p 684p1194p 369p934p Experience to date has shown that approximately 15% 2006: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to redundancies.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last eight years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
