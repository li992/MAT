24 ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS Details with regard to acquisitions made during the year ended 31 December 2007 are set out below: MedImmune, Inc. On 1 June 2007, AstraZeneca announced the successful tender offer for all the outstanding shares of common stock of MedImmune, Inc. a world-leading biotechnology company with proven biologics discovery and development strength, pipeline and leading biomanufacturing capability.
At that date, approximately 96.0% of the outstanding shares were successfully tendered: the remaining shares were acquired by 18 June 2007.
The financial results of MedImmune, Inc. have been consolidated into the Groups results from 1 June 2007.
Cash consideration of $13.9bn was paid for the outstanding shares.
After taking account of the cash and investments acquired, together with the settlement of MedImmunes convertible debt and outstanding share options, the total cash paid to acquire MedImmune was $15.6bn.
In most business acquisitions, there is a part of the cost that is not capable of being attributed in accounting terms to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is therefore recognised as goodwill.
In the case of the acquisition of MedImmune, this goodwill is underpinned by a number of elements, which individually cannot be quantified.
Most significant amongst these is the premium attributable to a pre-existing, well positioned business in the innovation intensive, high growth biologics market with a highly skilled workforce and established reputation.
Other important elements include buyer specific synergies, potential additional indications for identified products and the core technological capabilities and knowledge base of the company.
MedImmune, Inc. contributed $714m of turnover in the period since acquisition.
After amortisation, net investments interest costs including interest costs of external financing of $446m and tax, the loss attributable to MedImmune since acquisition is $410m.
If the acquisition had taken effect at the beginning of the reporting period 1 January 2007, on a proforma basis the revenue, profit before tax and profit after tax of the combined Group for the year would have been $30,127m, $7,576m and $5,351m, respectively.
Basic and diluted Earnings per Share for the combined Group would have been $3.56 and $3.55, respectively.
This proforma information has been prepared taking into account amortisation, interest costs and related tax effects but does not purport to represent the results of the combined Group that actually would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on 1 January 2007 and should not be taken to be representative of future results.
