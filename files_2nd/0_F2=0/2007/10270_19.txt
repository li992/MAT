The additional 1.4m profit arising in 2007 on that transaction was a result of releasing accruals that are no longer required on capital expenditure relating to those assets.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED b Transfer to lease premium prepayments The transfer to lease premium prepayments in 2006 represents the recognition of initial payments made in respect of operating leased land held under short leases.
These leases had been misclassified under Property, plant and equipment in the 2005 Financial Statements.
c Disposal to CDLHT The 2006 disposal to CDLHT, in which the Group holds a 38.5% interest as at 31 December 2007 31 December 2006: 39.3%, represents the property, plant and equipment element of the sale and lease back of three Singapore hotels.
The disposal amount has been adjusted in respect of the land lease element of the transaction on the 75-year leases of the Orchard Hotel and M Hotel.
In the 2006 Financial Statements these land leases were recorded as a disposal, but this treatment has been reviewed as the 75 year lease does not represent the disposal of the substantial benefit of the lands indefinite life.
Accordingly the land leases are now recognised on the balance sheet at their aggregate value at the date of the transaction of 87.5m and the disposal figure in the note above has been reduced by the same amount.
The prepaid operating land lease income is recognised on the balance sheet as deferred income, and will be amortised over the 75 years of the lease.
At 31 December 2007 an amount of 85.9m is recognised on the balance sheet as deferred income, 84.7m in non-current creditors and 1.2m in current creditors and an amount of 1.6m has been credited to the 2007 income statement which consists of 0.5m in respect of the prior year.
d Land and buildings Land and buildings includes long leasehold building assets with a book value of 342.3m 2006: 355.6m and assets held under finance leases with a net book value of 0.1m 2006: 10.6m.
The net book value of land and buildings held under short leases was 13.4m 2006: 5.7m, in respect of which depreciation of 1.4m 2006: 2.3m was charged during the year.
No interest has been capitalised within land and buildings during the year 2006: nil.
The cumulative interest within land and buildings is 4.4m 2006: 4.4m.
In line with local tax regimes, tax relief is obtained in the United Kingdom and France on 100% of the interest capitalised in the year, in the United States of America over the period of amortisation of the related asset and in New Zealand no tax relief is available.
e Impairment The Directors undertake an annual review of the carrying value of hotel and property assets for indications of impairment, as required by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where appropriate, external property valuations are also undertaken.
An impairment charge of 7.0m 2006: 3.5m has been recorded within administrative expenses in the year as shown in note 2 and comprises a charge relating to property, plant and equipment of 7.0m 2006: 2.4m and a charge made to the lease premium prepayment of nil 2006: 1.1m as shown in note 9.
In 2007, the impairment charge and the estimated recoverable amount was based on the hotel propertys value in use, determined using a discount rate of 11.0% in relation to the Millennium Resort Scottsdale McCormick Ranch, 12.0% in relation to the Millennium Hotel St Louis and 8.0% 2006: 7.8% in relation to Millennium Hotel & Resort Stuttgart.
f Pledged assets At year-end, the net book value of assets pledged as collateral for secured loans was 245.3m 2006: 690.2m, the security for the loans is by way of charges on the properties of Group companies concerned.

Further details are given in note 31.
Notes a CDLHT is quoted on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited and as at 31 December 2007 its share price was S$2.35 2006: S$1.67.
For the Groups 38.5% 2006: 39.3% interest, this equates to a market capitalisation of 259.0m 2006: 175.5m.
b Additions joint ventures In 2007 the Group, via its subsidiary Zillion Holdings Limited, acquired a 30% share in Beijing Fortune Hotel Co Limited, for 9.9m.
The joint venture will own and operate the Grand Millennium Beijing which is expected to open in 2008.
Additions associates The Group through a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium & Copthorne Hotels New Zealand Limited ``MCHNZ entered into a Strategic Cooperation Agreement to invest in a property related group of companies operating predominantly in China i-Vale with a wholly owned subsidiary of Tai Tak Estates Sdn Bhd ``Tai Tak, Guangdong Idea Valley Group Co. Ltd. the then holding company of i-Vale Group and its Chief Executive Officer, Mr Cheung Ping-Kwong.
As at 31 December 2007, MCHNZ and Tai Tak have each contributed approximately 16.5m into a newly incorporated company, First Sponsor Capital Limited which has acquired a 60% majority equity interest in i-Vale Group with the management team of i-Vale, including Mr Cheung, holding the remaining 40% minority equity stake.
As at 31 December 2007, MCHNZ holds 24.5% of the ordinary share capital and 50.0% of the preference share capital of First Sponsor Capital Limited, resulting in a 49.99% effective economic interest held by MCHNZ in the company or a 35.0% effective economic interest held by the Group after taking into account the Groups 70.0% interest in MCHNZ.
The Group accounts for its investment in First Sponsor Capital Limited as an associated company in which it has significant influence but no control over the financial and operating policies.
In addition to the 79.0m invested in CDLHT in 2006, the Group subscribed to a CDLHT rights issue which involved an additional investment in CDLHT of 33.3m and received stapled securities in CDLHT in lieu of payment of management and acquisition fees amounting to 2.3m.
c In line with the Groups accounting policy, transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
The 9.3m deduction from the Groups share of the associates net assets in 2006 represent the unrealised profit element from disposing of the three Singapore hotels to CDLHT in which the Group had an initial 39.1% interest.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES CONTINUED The Group has subsequently identified that it would be more appropriate for the unrealised gain to be recognised on a pre-tax basis.
Accordingly, the 2.7m net tax credit comprising a 3.4m deferred tax credit offset by a 0.7m current tax charge, has been released to the 2007 income statement with the corresponding amount debited to the carrying value of associates.

In 2007, an independent valuation company having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the Sunnyvale redevelopment, prepared a report on the propertys value in order to provide the Groups Directors with an independent perspective to their assessment of the propertys value.
With uncertainties in the US property market, the Directors now consider the propertys net realisable value to be 15.5m and this resulted in a write-down of 9.6m to the carrying value of this property.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, and the Groups policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
a Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment securities.
Exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis, credit checks being performed on all clients requiring credit over certain amounts.
Credit is not extended beyond authorised limits, established where appropriate through consultation with a professional credit vetting organisation.
Credit granted is subject to regular review, to ensure it remains consistent with the clients current credit worthiness and appropriate to the anticipated volume of business.
Investments are allowed only in liquid short-term instruments within approved limits, with investment counterparties approved by the Board.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset on the balance sheet, these being spread across the various currencies and jurisdictions in which the Group operates.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED b Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments, which are discounted using the interest rate prevailing as at the reporting date.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The primary objectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and to identify and manage financial risks, including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities.
If appropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks, as set out below: i Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue, purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars, New Zealand dollars, Australian dollars, New Taiwan dollars and Korean won.
The Groups principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated in the same currency.
Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure, an appropriate proportion of net assets is designated as hedged against corresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity, to the extent that the hedge is effective.
The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Groups net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
Foreign currency translation exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in the same currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits, using spot or shortterm forward contracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined.
Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Reporting date Sterling 2007 2006 2007 2006 US dollar 1.998 1.837 1.985 1.957 Singapore dollar 3.010 2.925 2.882 3.007 New Zealand dollar 2.711 2.817 2.577 2.782 Australian dollar 2.394 2.442 2.270 2.491 New Taiwan dollar 66.455 60.687 65.351 64.876 Korean won 1,854.837 1,754.709 1,859.355 1,816.918 Sensitivity analysis With respect to the Groups foreign currency translation exposure, and assuming that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant, it is estimated that a 10 percent strengthening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss before tax by the amounts shown below: 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 Profit Profit Equity before tax Equity before tax m m m m US dollar 36.6 1.1 37.8 2.9 Singapore dollar 28.6 7.2 25.2 4.5 New Zealand dollar 13.2 1.5 11.0 1.4 Australian dollar 5.1 0.3 6.6 0.5 New Taiwan dollar 15.0 1.0 14.4 0.9 Korean won 9.1 1.0 9.2 0.6 107.6 12.1 104.2 10.8 A 10 percent weakening of sterling against the above currencies at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
98 Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2007 18.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED ii Interest rate risk The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account market expectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt, and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floating rates presently as this flexibility is being considered to be appropriate in the context of the Groups overall geographical diversity, investment and business cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefit from the flexibility of variable rate borrowings.
The Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives.
Interest rate derivatives, if any, are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Groups balance sheet.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of one percentage point in the average interest rates applicable to variable rate instruments for the year would have increased decreased the Groups profit before tax for the year as shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 2007 31 December 2006 1% 1% 1% 1% increase decrease increase decrease m m m m Variable rate financial assets 1.4 1.4 0.9 0.9 Variable rate financial liabilities 3.5 3.5 4.5 4.5 Cash flow sensitivity net 2.1 2.1 3.6 3.6 In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they re-price and in addition shows non-interest bearing financial assets and liabilities.

Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price and deducting the current spot rate.
For interest rate swaps bank valuations are used.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All other receivables payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair value Prevailing market interest rates are used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Pension arrangements The Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The most significant funds are described below: United Kingdom The Group operates a pension scheme the Millennium & Copthorne Pension Plan for its UK employees, which was set up in 1993.
The scheme is a funded defined benefit arrangement with different categories of membership.
During 2007, as appointed by the Trustees of the Plan, Russell Investments Ltd formerly known as The Frank Russell Company Limited and Legal and General Investment Management Limited were the investment managers of the Plan.
The assets of the Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit credit method.
The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 6 April 2005 and this has been updated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2007.
The contributions of the Group during the year were 20.5% of pensionable salary, plus enhanced contributions of 1.1m per annum to remove the plans deficit.
The same rate of contributions are expected to be paid during 2008.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants, the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to mortality, the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Korea The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Korea.
The contributions required are determined by an external qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2007.
The contributions of the Group were 10.9% 2006: 17.0% of the employees earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
Taiwan The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan.
The contributions of the Group were 6% 2006: 6% of the employees earnings.
The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principal assumptions: 2007 2007 2007 2006 2006 2006 UK Korea Taiwan UK Korea Taiwan Inflation rate 3.20% 2.50% 3.10% 2.30% Discount rate 5.90% 7.00% 2.75% 5.23% 5.00% 2.50% Rate of salary increase 3.70% 5.00% 3.00% 3.60% 5.00% 3.00% Rate of pension increases 3.20% 3.10% Annual expected return on plan assets 7.24% 5.00% 2.75% 6.17% 4.00% 2.50% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not be necessarily borne out in practice.
The present value of the schemes liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
The expected annual return on UK plan assets for 2007 of 7.24% has been calculated using a 7.70% return on equity representing 75% of plan assets and a 5.90% return on bonds representing 25% of plan assets.
The discount rate used in respect of the UK pension scheme of 5.90% 2006: 5.23% was based on the yield of the Merrill Lynch over-15 year AA rated corporate bond index.

The 2006 actuarial loss was principally a result of the mortality rates used.

Details of these schemes are given in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policy O iv, on share-based payment transactions, the fair value of share options and long-term incentive awards are recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the share options and long-term incentive awards.
The charge to the income statement in the year was 0.8m 2006: 0.6m.
The Group applied IFRS 2 to its active employee share-based payment arrangements at 1 January 2005 except for equity-settled employee share-based payment arrangements granted before 7 November 2002.
The Group has granted employee equity-settled share-based payments in 2006 and 2007.
The adoption of IFRS 2 is equity neutral for equity-settled transactions.

2 9.5m of deferred tax has been released due to under over provisions in respect of prior years, the conclusion of reviews by tax authorities and other timing differences.
3 In relation to the disposal to CDLHT in 2006, an over provision of deferred tax totalling 3.4m has been recognised in 2007, see note 11 c. 4 Employee benefits comprise defined benefit pension schemes and share-based payment arrangements.
In relation to 0.6m charged to reserves in 2007, there is a 1.2m charge relating to defined benefit pension schemes offset by a 0.6m credit relating to share-based payment arrangements.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when deferred taxes relate to the same taxation authority.
In 2006, deferred tax liabilities totalling 9.1m and relating to the three hotels sold to CDLHT in that year, were released as a result of that transaction.
The balance released represented the total of the brought forward balance at 1 January 2006 on the three properties 7.6m and the increase charge in the period to disposal 1.6m, less a foreign exchange adjustment of 0.1m.
The release of 9.1m was credited in part to the 2006 income statement 5.4m, in part to reserves 0.3m and in part was deferred as part of the unreleased profit on disposal 3.4m.
As explained further in note 11, the tax element of the unrealised profit on the transaction, including the 3.4m deferred tax credit, has subsequently been credited to the income statement in 2007.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

HBT is a business trust which is dormant.
It exists primarily as a master lessee of last resort and will become active if H-REIT is unable to appoint a master lessee for any of the hotels in its portfolio at the expiry of the relevant master lease agreement or for a newly acquired hotel.
HBT may also become active if it undertakes certain hospitality and hospitality-related development projects, acquisitions and investments which may not be suitable for H-REIT.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS Management discussed, with the Audit Committee, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year.
The Group evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.
Such estimates and judgements are based upon historical experience and other factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies, among others, affect the Groups more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Actual results could differ from the Groups estimates and assumptions.
Asset carrying values Land and buildings are stated at cost or deemed cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
The assessment for possible revaluation and impairment requires the Group to make certain judgements, including property valuations and future cash flows from the respective properties and investments.
A review of recoverability of property valuations and investment carrying values is made whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable.
Defined benefit pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans.
As set out in note 19, the calculation of the present value of the Groups defined benefit obligations at each period end is subject to significant estimation.
An appropriately qualified, independent actuary is used to undertake this calculation.
The assumptions made by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial Millennium & Copthorne Hotels plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2007 119 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 31.
ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS CONTINUED assumptions, which due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The valuation of scheme assets is based on their fair value at the balance sheet date.
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short-term, their values may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
Taxation The Group has, from time-to-time, contingent tax liabilities arising from trading and corporate transactions.
After taking appropriate external professional advice, the Group makes provision for these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may be incurred and which is reliably measureable.
Investment in CDLHT As set out in note 11, in 2006 the Group acquired a 39.1% interest in CDLHT, a stapled security listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited, comprising a hotel real estate investment trust REIT and a business trust.
The business trust is dormant.
The Groups interest in CDLHT at 31 December 2007 was 38.5%.
CDLHT is not considered to be a special purpose entity under Standing Interpretations Committee 12: Consolidation Special Purpose Entities, and the Group does not have, by virtue of its unit holdings, the power to control a majority of the voting rights of the units of CDLHT.
However, as further noted in note 29, the Group acts as REIT Manager through a wholly owned company, under the terms of the trust deed constituting the REIT.
The Directors have therefore given careful consideration to the Groups interest in and relationship with CDLHT for the purposes of assessing whether it should be consolidated in accordance with IAS 27: Consolidation and Separate Financial Statements.
A subsidiary of the Group, M&C REIT Management Limited, in its capacity as REIT Manager, has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
However, there are certain substantive kick-out rights that prevent the Group from exercising the power to control the majority of the Board of the REIT Manager so as to be able to govern the financial and operating policies of the REIT.
The Group does not therefore control CDLHT and it is not a subsidiary of the Group.
Because of the significant influence that the Group has by way of its holding of 38.5% of CDLHT units and representation on the Board of the REIT Manager, the Group equity accounts for its interest in CDLHT as an associate.
Lease backs from CDLHT As part of the transactions with CDLHT in 2006 and as explained in note 8 c, the Group entered into sale and lease back arrangements in respect of three hotels in Singapore.
As further explained in note 29, the Group entered into 20 year leases with CDLHT for each of the hotel buildings with variable rent based on the hotels performance but subject to a fixed minimum rental, and with an option granted to the Group to renew for a further 20 years on the same rental terms.
Although the Group has the option to lease the building assets for a total of 40 years, there remains a substantial proportion of the assets economic lives for which the Group will not benefit from the assets.
In addition, the present value of the minimum lease payments for the 40-year potential term of the three leases do not constitute substantially all of the fair value of the leased assets, and the variable rent structure is such that the Group does not retain significant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets.
Accordingly, the Group has classified the lease back arrangements as operating leases in accordance with IAS 17: Leases In addition, the Groups lease of the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel from CDLHT as part of the 2006 transactions entered with CDLHT has also been similarly accounted for by the Group as an operating lease for the same reasons noted above.
Investment property The Group holds a number of investment properties and accounts for such properties in accordance with the accounting policy set out on page 75.
CDLHT owns hotel assets which are leased to both the Group and external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to the agreement involved.
The Group accounts for such hotel assets in its financial statements in accordance with the accounting policy set out on page 75.
The Group is required to consider whether the relevant hotel assets held by CDLHT are owner-occupied or not, for the purposes of assessing whether IAS 40, Investment Property is applicable and whether therefore, accounting for the relevant hotels as investment properties is appropriate for the purposes of the Groups financial statements.
The question of whether or not a property is owneroccupied is a matter of judgement, involving consideration of various factors such as, the length of the agreement involved, the powers of intervention and level of influence on financial and operating decisions held by the Group or CDLHT, and the extent of the Group or CDLHTs interest in the profits and cash flows generated by the relevant properties.
Where the indicators are such that on balance, CDLHT is, in the Groups opinion, shown to be a passive investor, the relevant hotel property is accounted for in accordance with IAS 40 and the Group accounts for its share of the fair value change through the income statement as a share of other operating income of the associate.
Where indicators are of an owner-occupied property, the hotel is classified as part of CDLHTs property, plant and equipment with the Groups share of CDLHTs results for the period incorporating an appropriate depreciation charge.
