The most important components of financial risk for the Company are interest rate risk, currency risk and credit risk.
These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements.
The principal risk the Company faces is currency risk.
The Companys functional and presentational currency is GBP, whereas the functional currencies of its principal subsidiaries are South African Rand, US Dollar, Swedish Krona and Euro.
a Capital risk management Old Mutual plc is the holding company of the Group and is responsible for the raising and allocation of capital in line with the Groups capital management policies set out in note 48 to the consolidated financial statements and for ensuring the operational funding and regulatory capital needs of the holding company and its subsidiaries are met at all times.
b Currency risk The Company is exposed to effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows.
The principal foreign currency risk arises from the fact that the Companys functional currency is GBP, whereas the functional currency of its principal operations is South African Rand, US Dollar, Swedish Krona and Euro.
The Company hedges some of this currency translation risk through currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange rate contracts.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts and currency swap agreements.
The table below summarises the Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk: m At 31 December 2007 GBP ZAR USD Euro SEK Other Reclassification Total Assets Investments in associated undertakings 25 25 1 Derivative financial instruments assets 29 33 4 6 72 Placements with other banks 18 15 8 41 Investments and securities 45 45 Other non-financial assets 5,108 1,111 36 1,466 14 7,735 Total assets 5,225 15 1,152 40 1,466 14 6 7,918 Liabilities 2 Other borrowed funds 272 359 43 470 10 1,134 3 Derivative financial instruments liabilities 851 1 16 31 Other non-financial liabilities 484 1 1,220 36 27 1,768 Total liabilities 764 6 1,580 79 498 6 2,933 Old Mutual plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Financial statements of the Company 237 Notes to the Company financial statements 11 Financial risk continued b Currency risk continued m At 31 December 2006 GBP ZAR USD Euro SEK Other Reclassification Total Assets Investments in associated undertakings 13 13 Derivative financial instruments assets 101 101 Placements with other banks 27 10 2 39 Investments and securities 56 56 Other non-financial assets 5,560 112 1,669 14 13 7,368 Total assets 5,656 112 1,679 16 13 101 7,577 Liabilities Other borrowed funds 55 314 12 463 98 942 Derivative financial instruments liabilities 10 1 6 1 3 21 Other non-financial liabilities 481 1,179 3 5 1,668 Total liabilities 546 1 1,493 21 469 101 2,631 1 The derivative financial instruments of 6 million 2006: 101 million represent currency hedge for borrowed funds and so have been reclassified and netted against USD borrowed funds.
2 The total of 359 million USD 2006: 314 million and 470 million SEK 2006: 463 million of borrowed funds have been net of hedges in derivative financial instruments of 6 million and 16 million respectively.
3 The derivative financial instruments of 16 million 2006: 3 million represent currency hedge for borrowed funds and so have been reclassed and netted against SEK borrowed funds.
c Credit risk The Company is principally exposed to credit risk through cash at bank, which it holds to back shareholder liabilities.
Credit risk is managed by placing limits on exposures to any single counterparty, or groups of counterparties and to geographical and industry segments.
Credit risk is monitored with reference to established credit rating agencies with limits placed on exposure to below investment grade holdings.
The following table analyses the credit rating Standard & Poors or equivalent by investment grade of financial assets bearing credit risk: m Sub-investment Investment Grade Grade At 31 December 2007 AAA to BBB BB and lower Not rated Total Investments in associated undertakings 25 25 Derivative financial instruments assets 72 72 Investments and securities 45 45 Placements with other banks 41 41 Financial assets bearing credit risk 113 70 183 At 31 December 2006 Investments in associated undertakings 13 13 Derivative financial instruments assets 101 101 Investments and securities 56 56 Placements with other banks 39 39 Financial assets bearing credit risk 140 69 209 d Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that fluctuating interest rates will unfavourably affect the Companys earnings and the value of its assets, liabilities and capital.
The Company employs currency and interest rate swap transactions to mitigate against the impact of changes in the fair values of its borrowed funds.
Details of the arrangements in place are shown in the Group Accounts note 29 Hedge accounting.
12 Post balance sheet events Post year end, the Company provided a guarantee in relation to a block of business sold by one of its subsidiary undertakings, on behalf of a third party.
The maximum cumulative aggregate liability of the Guarantor in relation to all and any claims under this guarantee shall in no event exceed 126 million, over a 10 year period.
The probability of payment of such an amount is considered very low.
