Insurance contracts continued ii The With-Profits Fund of FPLA is closed to new business.
The Funds policyholders are entitled to all the surplus of that fund.
In addition, FPLA has a closed unitised with-profits fund.
Shareholders are entitled to all profits from the unitised with-profit fund other than investment profits, which are wholly owned by with-profits policyholders.
The investment element of the contract is wholly reinsured to the FPLP With-Profits Fund.
The effect of this fund structure is that investment risk, in respect of assets backing with-profits policies, is largely borne by policyholders: shareholders bear 10% of the investment risk from conventional with-profits policies.
Expense risk is borne by the shareholders, other than in the FPLA closed fund.
Until 2009, the FPLP With-Profits Fund is charged a fixed amount for managing policies, adjusted by an inflation index, irrespective of actual costs.
The charges will be reviewed with effect from the end of 2009 to reflect market rates at the time.
Other forms of risk are shared between shareholders and policyholders as described above.
FPLPs With-Profits Balance Sheet FPLPs with-profits business can be summarised as follows: 2007 2006 m m Total net assets 14,739 16,087 Less non-profit liabilities including long-term insurance capital requirements 2,561 2,670 Total regulatory assets 12,178 13,417 Additional assets arising on realistic basis 219 265 Total assets 12,397 13,682 Policyholder liabilities: Asset shares 10,323 11,365 Financial guarantees net of charges 210 101 Options guaranteed annuities 628 747 Other liabilities 990 1,249 Total liabilities 12,151 13,462 Excess of assets over liabilities 246 220 At 31 December 2007, the surplus of assets over liabilities initially amounted to 274m 2006: 254m with a Risk Capital Margin RCM of 246m 2006: 220m, the surplus assets have subsequently been reduced by 28m 2006: 34m via a reduction in future guarantee charges leaving the working capital at 246m 2006: 220m fully covering the RCM.
Adding back the shareholders share of future bonuses totalling 94m 2006: 95m and deducting adjustments to eliminate double counting of other assets of 2m 2006: 19m, the excess in accordance with FRS 27 amounted to 338m 2006: 296m.
The main element of the liabilities is the asset shares of with-profits business.
This represents the premiums received to date together with the investment return earned less expenses and charges.
This is mainly calculated on an individual policy basis using historic information and in line with the companys PPFM.
Asset shares are closely matched since they move with the value of the underlying assets.
Policyholder liabilities including options and guarantees are then valued using a market consistent stochastic model.
Included in other liabilities are provisions for specific items such as mortgage endowment reviews and other liabilities of the fund.
Realistic valuations also allow for future profits of non-profit business written in the With-Profits Fund to be included.
In accordance with FRS 27, the value of future profits of non-profit business has been deducted from policyholder liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet.

A summary of the key assumptions is as follows: The majority of the Groups life and pensions options and guarantees are within FPLPs With-Profits Fund.
These are valued stochastically Policy discontinuances: lapse, early retirement and paid-up rates vary and included in the liabilities.
There are two main types of by policy type and period and have been based on recent experience.

Early retirement rates vary by age band and policy type and have been reviewed and amended in 2007 based on recent experience.

The cost of guarantees also depends on management actions that would be taken under various scenarios.
The regular bonus rate is set each year such that, by maturity, guaranteed benefits are targeted as a prescribed fraction of the total asset share, leaving the remaining portion of the asset share to be paid as final bonus.
This management action is in line with the companys PPFM and is programmed into the model.
