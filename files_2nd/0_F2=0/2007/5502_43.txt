As at 29 September 2007, adjusting to the Groups accounting policies, the Groups share of Welbilt Thailands total assets was 1.7m 2006: 1.8m and total liabilities was 0.6m 2006: 0.5m.
For the 52 weeks ended on 29 September 2007, the Groups share of Welbilt Thailands revenues was 2.7m 2006: 2.7m and operating profit was nil 2006: nil.
During 2006, management reviewed the performance of Welbilt Thailand and concluded that the net present value of future trading performance discounted at a risk adjusted rate of 12% did not fully support the carrying value.
As a consequence, a charge of 0.5m was charged to profit and loss in the Foodservice Europe Asia segment during 2006.
As the Group does not control Welbilt Thailand, the Group applies equity accounting for its investment interest.
