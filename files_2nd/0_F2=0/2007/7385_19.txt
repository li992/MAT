Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Adoption of new and revised Standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital.
2. significant accounting policies Basis of accounting Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLCs consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the revaluation to market of certain financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups previously published financial statements were also prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.
These International Financial Reporting Standards have been subject to amendment and interpretation by the International Accounting Standards Board and the financial statements presented for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2007 have been prepared in accordance with those revised standards.
Unless stated otherwise these policies are in accordance with the revised standards that have been applied throughout the year and prior years presented in these financial statements.
The presentational and functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC is the US Dollar as the majority of the Companys business is conducted in US Dollars $.
The significant accounting policies are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC the Company and entities controlled by the Company together the Group and the Groups share of the results and net assets of its associates.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies either directly or indirectly of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identied separately from the Groups equity therein.
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minoritys proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, any losses applicable to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classied as held for sale.
significant inuence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but not control or joint control over these policies.
Investment in joint venture A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and a third-party undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control over an economic activity, and exists only when the strategic financial and operating decisions relating to the activity require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control the venturers.
60 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Each venturer contributes cash or other resources to the jointly controlled entity.
These contributions are included in the accounting records of the venturer and recognised in its financial statements as an investment in the jointly controlled entity.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using proportionate consolidation.
The application of proportionate consolidation means that the balance sheet of the Group includes its share of the assets that it controls jointly and its share of the liabilities for which it is jointly responsible.
Intangible assets a Goodwill: arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Marketing rights: are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year in which the rights first generate sales.
c Customer relationships: represent the value attributed to the long-term relationships held with existing customers at the date of acquisition and are amortised over their useful economic life.
d Product related intangibles: i product les and under-licenced products are assigned indefinite useful lives which are reviewed for impairment at least annually: any impairment is recognised immediately in profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed: and ii Under-licence agreements and product dossiers are amortised over their useful lives commencing in the year acquired.
e Purchased software: is amortised over the useful economic lives commencing when the asset is available for use.
f In process research and development is amortised over the useful life commencing in the year acquired.
g Trade name: some trade names are assigned indefinite useful lives and others have nite useful lives over which they are amortised.
The trade names with indefinite useful lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually: any impairment is recognised immediately in profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Foreign currencies For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in US Dollars, the functional currency of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in currencies other than local currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value and the related foreign exchange are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised in the income statement when goods or services are supplied or made available to external customers against orders received and when title and risk of loss has passed.
Revenue represents the amounts receivable after the deduction of discounts, value added tax, other sales taxes, and allowances given and accruals for estimated future rebates and returns.
The methodology and assumptions used to estimate rebates and returns are monitored and adjusted regularly in light of contractual and historical information and past experience.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Chargebacks The provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue.
In the USA the Group sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies.
The Group also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organisations, hospitals, and Group purchasing organisations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.
The Group enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products.
The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which they purchase the products at agreed-upon prices.
The Group will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed-upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesalers invoice price.
This credit is called a chargeback.
The provision for chargebacks is based on historical sell-through levels by the Groups wholesale customers to the indirect customers, and estimated wholesaler inventory levels.
As sales are made to the large wholesale customers, the Group continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes that actual chargebacks may differ from estimated reserves.
Returns and rebates In certain countries and consistent with industry practice, the Group has a product return policy that allows selected customers to return the product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date, in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases.
The Group estimates its provision for returns and rebates based on historical experience, changes to business practices and credit terms.
While such experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns.
The Group continually monitors the provisions for returns and rebates, and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from established reserves.
Price adjustments Price adjustments, also known as shelf stock adjustments, are credits issued to reect decreases in the selling prices of the Groups products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of the price reduction.
Decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by Group management to reect competitive market conditions.
Amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated declines in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers.
The Group regularly monitors these and other factors and re-evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
To the extent that variable rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective cash ow hedge of interest rate risk, the effective portion of the derivative is deferred in equity and released to profit or loss when the qualifying asset impacts profit or loss.
To the extent that xed rate borrowings are used to finance a qualifying asset and are hedged in an effective fair value hedge of interest rate risk, the capitalised borrowing costs reect the hedged interest rate.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specic borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Dividend income Income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leasing Leases are classied as capital leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under capital leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a capital lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
62 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Research and development Research and development expenses are fully charged to the income statement, as the Group considers that the regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of its products generally mean that the recognition criteria in IAS 38 Intangible assets are not met.
Where, however the recognition criteria are met, intangible assets will be recognised and amortised over their useful economic life.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to dened contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to dened contribution schemes where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a dened contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Tax The Group provides for income tax according to the laws and regulations prevailing in the countries where the Group operates.
Furthermore, the Group computes and records deferred tax assets and liabilities according to IAS 12 Income Taxes.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statements because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 Share-based Payments requires an expense to be recognised when the Group buys goods or services in exchange for share or rights over shares share based payments or in exchange for other equivalent assets.
The cost of share-based payments transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which the share-based payments are granted.
The equity settled stock options scheme fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The long-term incentive plan fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.
The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations further details are given in Note 35.
In valuing share-based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the market price of the shares of Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 63 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. significant accounting policies continued The cost of share-based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of a share-based payments are modied, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modication, as measured at the modication date.
Where a share-based payments award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for a cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding share-based payments is reected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment have been valued at cost on acquisition and are depreciated, except for land, on a straight-line basis at the following depreciation rates: Buildings 2% to 4% Vehicles 10% to 20% Machinery and equipment 5% to 20% Fixtures and equipment 8% to 33% Projects under construction are not depreciated until construction has been completed.
Any additional costs that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are capitalised.
Property, plant and equipment which are nanced by leases giving Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease, and depreciated in the same manner as other property, plant and equipment over the shorter of the lease term or their useful life.
Whenever the recoverable amount of an asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is taken to the income statement.
Projects under construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation of these assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Purchased products are valued at acquisition cost and all other costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost of own-manufactured products comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
In the balance sheet, inventory is primarily valued at standard cost, which approximates to historical cost determined on a moving average basis, and this value is used to determine the cost of sales in the income statement.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion and all estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Provisions are made for inventories with net realisable value lower than cost or for slow moving inventory.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
The principal derivative instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at cost and then remeasured at subsequent reporting dates to fair value.
Hedging derivatives are classied on inception as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, with the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designed as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement in line with the hedged forecast transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for in a similar way to cash ow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the income statement.
64 Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Investments Available for sale investments with quoted market prices are initially recognised at cost on acquisition and remeasured to their fair values at year-end.
Gains or losses on remeasurement to fair value are recognised in shareholders equity until the investments are sold, disposed of, or determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gains or loss relating to these investments previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets without market prices and the fair value of which cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, less a provision for any impairment loss, which is taken to the income statement.
The fair value of quoted financial assets represents the closing price in the financial markets at the date of the financial statements.
However, the fair value of unquoted financial assets, or those with no declared price are estimated by comparing the fair value of a similar financial instrument or through a discounted cash ow method.
Accounts receivable Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligations and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset for which the estimates of future cash ows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or income-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset income-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 65 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3. Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions Generics, Branded and Injectables.

These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
In addition, a deferred tax asset of approximately $5.0 million 2006: $8.5 million on other deductible temporary differences has not been recognised due to uncertainty regarding the tax treatment of the profits against which these differences will reverse.
As at 31 December 2007, the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries amounted to $195 million 2006: $161 million.
No income taxes have been provided on the Companys share of these undistributed earnings due to managements ability and intent to reinvest such amounts indefinitely.
A determination of the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practical to do so.
A portion of these earnings can be distributed without incurring additional taxes.

Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specic trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.

The average lease term is five years 2006: six years.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the average effective borrowings rate was between 3.9% and 7.5% 2006: between 3.8% and 7.0%.
Financial policies for risk management and their objectives Credit risk: The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts, chargebacks in the US, expired goods and without recourse discounts.
A provision for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
As a market norm, clients in the MENA region are offered relatively longer payment terms compared to clients in Europe and the US.
As at 31 December 2007, the Groups largest three clients in the MENA region represented 14% of Group Turnover located in S. Arabia, 4% of Group turnover located in Algeria and 3% of Group turnover located in Algeria.
The amount of receivables due from the Algerian market for 2007 is $34,979,000 2006: $13,804,000.
The Group manages this risk through the implementation of stringent credit policies and procedures and certain credit insurance agreements.
As at 31 December 2007, none of the Groups major debtors have gone into liquidation.
Market risk: The Groups objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, uctuations in earnings and cash ow associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates.
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Management actively monitors these exposures to manage the volatility relating to these exposures by entering into a variety of derivative financial instruments.
Foreign exchange risk: The Group uses the US Dollar as its functional currency and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange movements primarily in European, Algerian and Japanese currencies.
Consequently, the Group enters into various contracts, which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to hedge against the risk of movement in foreign denominated assets and liabilities.
Interest rate risk: The Group manages its exposures to interest rate risks by changing the proportion of debt that is xed by entering into interest rate swap agreements.
Using these derivative financial instruments has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position at 31 December 2007 or the Groups results of operations for the year then ended.
As at 31 December 2007 As at 31 December 2006 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s $000s Financial liabilities Interest bearing loans and borrowings 50,106 284,093 334,199 45,195 15,758 60,953 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 28,905 28,905 86,227 86,227 An interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2007, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our debt portfolio as at 31 December 2007, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $2.8 million in interest expense being incurred per year.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 79 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28.
Financial policies for risk management and their objectives continued Fair value of financial assets and liabilities: The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value: Cash and cash equivalents approximates to the carrying amount: Short-term loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments: Long-term loans approximates to the carrying amount in the case of oating rate bank loans and other loans: Forward exchange contracts based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date: Receivables and payables approximates to the carrying amount: and Lease obligations approximates to the carrying value.
Management consider that the book value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities do not materially differ from their fair value.

This came as a result of increased borrowings to fund acquisitions during 2007.
The Group believes, that given the $158 million net equity placing in January that was used to repay short-term debt less than one year, its committed nancing headroom and forecast operating cash ow during 2008, it has the ability to satisfy its liability commitments.
Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC Annual report 2007 81 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 29.
Derivative financial instruments Currency derivatives The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash ows.
The Group is party to a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
At the balance sheet date, total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group was committed to, are as below.
2007 2006 $000s $000s Foreign exchange forward contracts and options Euro 1,471 Foreign exchange forward contracts Yen 578 These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures.
At 31 December 2007 the fair value of the Groups currency derivatives was a net loss of $24,889.
The fair valuation of the currency derivatives that are designated and effective as cash ow hedge resulted in a loss of $24,889 for the year ended 31 December 2007 that has been reected in equity.
These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
At 31 December 2006 there were no open forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of cash ow hedges of currency and interest rate uctuations is not significant and will not affect in a material way the financial health of the Group.
Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
These contracts with original nominal values of $15 million as at 31 December 2006 increasing to $23.8 million as at 31 December 2007 have xed interest payments at rates ranging from 3.9% to 4.75% for periods up until 2017 and have oating interest receipts at LIBOR.
The fair value of swaps entered into by the Group is estimated as a liability of $28,000 2006: $149,000.
These amounts are based on market values provided by the banks that originated the swaps and are based on equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Some of these interest rate swaps are designated as effective cash ow hedges and the fair value thereof totalling $82,000 2006: $149,000 has been deferred in equity.
The ineffective element of the cash ow hedges are taken to the income statement.
No gain or loss has been recognised in the income statement for the years ended 31 December 2007 and 2006.
The Group believes that the effect on the value of interest rate swaps by interest rate uctuations is not significant and will not affect in a material way the financial health of the Group.

The amount of goodwill recognised in relation to the Thymoorgan acquisition relates to the value attributed to the employee know how within the business, as Hikma do not have contractual or legal rights over these assets they do not meet the identiability criteria within IAS 38 and hence are reected within goodwill.
In addition, the goodwill is also attributable to the anticipated profitability of the distribution of the products manufactured into the new Hikma oncology market.

Contingent liabilities The Group was contingently liable for letters of guarantee and letters of credit totalling $17.8 million 2006: $16.9 million.
The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods and services should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is ongoing.
In common with many other companies in the pharmaceutical industries the Group is subject to certain legal and product liability claims from time to time.
Whilst provisions have been made for probable losses that management deems to be reasonable or appropriate there are inherent uncertainties connected with these estimates.
The Group does not expect the resolution of uncertainties to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Share-based payments Equity settled share option scheme During the year ended 31 December 2007 and 2006, the Company had two share-based compensation schemes settled by equity instruments with two separate grant dates.
The options over these instruments are settled in equity once exercised.
Details of the grants under the scheme are shown below: 2005 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 13 October 2005 Number granted 1,600,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.74.
This was calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $4.50, exercise price of $4.50, expected volatility of 26.2%, expected dividend yield of 6.67%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.54%.
To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the employees would exercise the options immediately after vesting date.
2004 Type of arrangement General employee share option plan Date of grant 12 October 2004 Number granted 9,520,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions 20% per year for five years beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the general employee share option plan is $0.35.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date of $0.91, exercise price of $0.91, expected volatility of 44.8%, expected dividend yield of 3.85%, expected contractual life of 7.5 years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.22%.

Share-based payments continued Further details of the general employee share option plan are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average Number of exercise Number of exercise shares option price in $ shares option price in $ Outstanding at 1 January 9,598,200 1.44 11,120,000 1.42 Exercised during the year 2,569,600 1.21 1,365,800 1.18 Expired during the year 169,200 4.25 156,000 2.94 Outstanding at 31 December 6,859,400 1.43 9,598,200 1.44 Exercisable at 31 December 2,046,733 1.00 2,606,200 1.09 The cost of the equity settled share option scheme of $865,000 2006: $879,000 has been recorded in the income statement as part of general and administrative expenses.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was $8.56.
The options outstanding at 31 December 2007 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of two to three years.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous three to four years.
Long-term incentive plan During the year, the Company granted awards under Hikma Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP to certain employees.
Under the LTIP, conditional awards of nominal cost share options are made which vest after three years subject to a total shareholder return TSR performance condition.
This condition measures the Groups TSR relative to a comparator group of other pharmaceutical companies.
In this case, the vesting schedule dictates that 20% of awards vest for median performance and 100% for upper quartile performance, with pro rata vesting in between these points.
No awards vest for performance which is below the median.
Details of the grants under the plan are shown below: 2 April 2007 Type of arrangement Long-Term Incentive Plan Date of grant 2 April 2007 Number granted 160,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions After three years subject to a TSR performance condition The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the LTIP is 2.20.
This was calculated by applying the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology for estimation of the fair value.
The model inputs were as follows: a the exercise price of the share award of nil: b the life of the share award of three years: c the current price of the underlying shares on the date of grant of 3.79: d the volatility of the Companys share returns of 34.64%: e expected dividend yield of 0.075%: and f the risk-free interest rate for the life of the share award of 5.40%.

Share-based payments continued The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the LTIP is 2.23.
The model inputs were as follows: a the exercise price of the share award b the life of the share award of three years: c the current price of the underlying shares on the date of grant of 3.84: d the volatility of the Companys share returns of 34.64%: e expected dividend yield of 0.075%: and f the risk-free interest rate for the life of the share award of 5.45%.
10 September 2007 Type of arrangement Long-Term Incentive Plan Date of grant 10 September 2007 Number granted 150,000 Contractual life 10 years Vesting conditions After three years subject to a TSR performance condition The estimated fair value of each share option granted in the LTIP is 2.3163.
The model inputs were as follows: a the exercise price of the share award b the life of the share award of three years: c the current price of the underlying shares on the date of grant of 4.08: d the volatility of the Companys share returns of 34.64%: e expected dividend yield of 0.075%: and f the risk-free interest rate for the life of the share award of 4.998%.
