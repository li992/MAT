b A provision was recognised in 2006 for the Groups onerous contract for Eurostar with ICRRL.
8.4m was paid to ICRRL during the year, which is offset by a receipt in relation to preference share dividends.
The provision will be utilised during the period up to the end of our contract in 2010, with the final payment being made in February 2011. c The following items are included within other provisions: i.
An increase in the provision for the expected liabilities in relation to the discontinued North American Public Transit business was recognised in the year, as disclosed in note 11.
These liabilities arise as the Group is a party to an industry-wide litigation in respect of working time regulations.
A provision has been recognised for the expected value of the settlement, but the total amount of the provisions recognised by the Group is not disclosed as this may prejudice the Groups position in this matter.
The whole provision is expected to be paid in 2008. ii.
A provision was recognised in the year for the disposal of Stewart of 0.9m.
The balance is expected to be paid in 2008. iii.
All other remaining provisions are expected to be paid within 2008.
When the effect is material, the provisions are discounted to their net present value.
