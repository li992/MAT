A summary of the provisional fair value of net assets acquired by geographical location is presented below: North New Total Europe America Markets group m m m m Provisional fair value of net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 7.8 0.3 9.4 17.5 Acquisition of minority interests 19.2 0.3 1.4 20.9 Total provisional fair value of net assets acquired 27.0 0.6 10.8 38.4 Goodwill 92.5 1.6 85.1 179.2 Total purchase consideration 119.5 2.2 95.9 217.6 70 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Acquisitions continued Current year acquisitions continued The following table sets out the book values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and their provisional fair value to the group in respect of all acquisitions made in the year: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value mm m Acquisition-related intangible assets 34.1 34.1 Other intangible assets 1.0 0.7 0.3 Property, plant and equipment 24.5 1.9 22.6 Inventories 4.0 0.4 3.6 Trade and other receivables 50.2 3.6 46.6 Deferred tax assets 0.1 0.1 Cash and cash equivalents 11.6 11.6 Trade and other payables 46.7 2.4 49.1 Current tax liabilities 1.6 1.1 2.7 Provisions 7.7 3.1 10.8 Borrowings 22.9 22.9 Deferred tax liabilities 9.7 9.7 Minority interests 10.7 4.5 6.2 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 1.8 15.7 17.5 Acquisition of minority interests 17.8 3.1 20.9 Goodwill 179.2 Total purchase consideration 217.6 Satisfied by: Cash 147.7 Transaction costs 3.9 Contingent consideration 66.0 Total purchase consideration 217.6 Adjustments made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reflect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 34.1m attributable to the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 3.1m attributable to the acquisition of minority interests.
The fair values of net assets acquired are provisional and represent estimates following a preliminary valuation exercise.
These estimates may be adjusted to reflect any development in the issues to which they relate.
Final fair value adjustments will, if required, be reflected in the comparative to the 2008 consolidated financial statements.
The goodwill arising on acquisitions can be ascribed to the existence of a skilled, active workforce and the opportunities to obtain new contracts and develop the business.
Neither of these meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets separable from goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisition includes 47.5m arising on the acquisition of minority interests.
From the date of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed 171.2m to revenues, 10.0m to PBITA and 0.3 m to profit for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2007, group revenue would have been 4,572.2m, PBITA would have been 321.0m and profit for the year would have been 162.4m.
Prior year acquisitions The group undertook a number of acquisitions in 2006, none of which were individually material.
Principal acquisitions in subsidiary undertakings included the purchase of controlling interests in the Chilean company, Servicios Generales, Limitada, a manned security services provider, and in al Majal Security Services, a security services and cash services business in Saudi Arabia.
In addition, the group increased its interests in United Arab Emirates.
71 17 Acquisitions continued Prior year acquisitions continued At 31 December 2006, the fair value adjustments made against net assets acquired were provisional.
The initial accounting in respect of acquisitions made during 2006 has since been finalised.
The net assets acquired and goodwill arising in respect of all acquisitions made in the year are as follows: Fair value Book value adjustments Fair value mm m Acquisition-related intangible assets 17.6 17.6 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets other than acquisition-related 7.0 0.5 6.5 Deferred tax assets 0.2 0.2 Current assets 22.0 2.1 19.9 Current liabilities 10.6 4.7 15.3 Non-current liabilities 6.6 6.4 13.0 Minority interests 1.8 0.6 1.2 Net assets acquired of subsidiary undertakings 10.2 4.5 14.7 Acquisition of minority interests 6.4 4.6 11.0 Goodwill 72.7 Total purchase consideration 98.4 Satisfied by: Cash 96.0 Transaction costs 0.7 Contingent consideration 1.7 Total purchase consideration 98.4 Included within current assets acquired is 3.5m of cash and cash equivalents.
Adjustments made to identifiable assets and liabilities on acquisition are to reflect their fair value.
These include the recognition of customer-related intangible assets amounting to 17.6m attributable to the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and 4.6m attributable to the acquisition of minority interests.
On completion of the fair value exercise during 2007, adjustments made to the provisional calculation amounted to 4.7m, with an equivalent increase in the reported value of goodwill.
The comparative balance sheet at 31 December 2006 has been restated accordingly.
Goodwill arising on acquisition includes 10.1m arising on the acquisition of minority interests.
In the year of acquisition, in aggregate, the acquired businesses contributed 57.1m to revenues, 7.8m to PBITA and 1.8m to profit for the part year they were under the groups ownership.
If all acquisitions had occurred on 1 January 2006, group revenue would have been 4,092.2m, PBITA would have been 279.5m and profit for the year would have been 110.0m.
Post balance sheet acquisitions A number of acquisitions were effected after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements were authorised for issue, none of which were individually material.
In aggregate, the acquisitions, primarily within Europe, North America and Africa, were satisfied by total consideration of 66m.
In addition, there was a cash outflow of 41m in respect of contingent consideration accrued at 31 December 2007.
It is considered impractical to disclose any further information in relation to acquisitions effected after the balance sheet date because the preliminary assessment of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired is in progress.
