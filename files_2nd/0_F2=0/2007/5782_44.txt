Interest on the $550m facility is calculated at 0.7% above LIBOR.
The loan re-prices at a frequency of between one week and six months.
The outstanding amount of the revolving credit facility is repayable on 30 June 2011 and the facility is secured by fixed and floating charges over the assets of the Group.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had $153m of committed borrowing facilities available.
As the facility is arranged at floating interest rates it exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The fair value of the facility is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets.
The main facility is collectively a designated net investment hedge against the Groups overseas subsidiaries.
Foreign exchange movements in the fair value of the facility loans are recognised directly in equity, offset against foreign exchange movements in the net investment.
At the 31 March 2007, current liabilities include a mortgage of NOK0.8m and a government loan of NOK2.3m.
The government loan carries an interest charge of 7.15% and the mortgage carries a half yearly re-fixing rate of NIBOR plus 0.45%.
The Group intends to settle the loan and mortgage within the next 12 months.
