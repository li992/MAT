Notes to accounts For the year ended 31 December 2007 15 Net foreign exchange gains losses The Group recognised foreign exchange gains of 8.0 million 2006: 26.9 million loss during the year.
The Group writes business in many currencies and although a large amount of the Groups balance sheet assets and liabilities are matched, minimising the effect of movements in foreign exchange rates on the Groups result, it is not possible, or practical, to match exactly all assets and liabilities in currency and accounting standards dictate that certain classes of assets and liabilities be translated at different rates see Foreign currency translation accounting policy.
Included within the Groups foreign exchange gains is 14.7 million 2006: 27.9 million loss due to the translation of non-monetary assets and liabilities at historic average rates.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on investments in overseas subsidiaries are taken directly to reserves in accordance with IAS21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
