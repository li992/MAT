Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
