ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CURRENT COST INFORMATION The current cost information has been prepared for the Appointed Business of Yorkshire Water Services Ltd in accordance with guidance issued by the Director General of Water Services for modified real terms financial statements suitable for regulation in the water industry.
Profitability is measured on the basis of real financial capital maintenance in the context of assets which are valued at their modern equivalent asset value to the business.
The accounting policies used are the same as those adopted in the statutory historical cost accounts, except as set out below.
Infrastructure assets As noted on page 43, FRS 12 has not been implemented in the regulatory accounts and the difference between planned and actual expenditure on infrastructure renewals is shown separately in the current cost balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets Assets in operational use are valued at the replacement cost of their operating capability.
To the extent that the regulatory regime does not allow such assets to earn a return high enough to justify that value, this represents a modification of the value to the business principle.
Also, no provision is made for the possible funding of future replacements of assets by contributions from third parties and, to the extent that some of those assets would on replacement be so funded, replacement cost again differs from value to the business.
Redundant assets are valued at their recoverable amount.
The modern equivalent asset values arising from the last Periodic Review are incorporated in the 2006 07 Regulatory Accounting Information.
- Land and buildings Non-specialised operational properties are valued on the basis of open market value for existing use and have been expressed in real terms by indexing using the Retail Price Index RPI.
Specialised operational properties are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and recoverable amount, restated annually between periodic Asset Management Plan AMP reviews by adjusting for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
The unamortised portion of third party contributions received is deducted in arriving at net operating assets as described below.
- Infrastructure assets Mains, sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls are valued at replacement cost, determined principally on the basis of data provided by the AMP.
Values now reflect the AMP carried out at the last Periodic Review.
A process of continuing refinement of asset records is expected to produce adjustments to existing values when periodic reviews of the AMP take place.
In the intervening years, values are restated to take account of changes in the general level of inflation, as measured by changes in the RPI over the year.
48 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information - Other fixed assets All other fixed assets are valued periodically at depreciated replacement cost.
Between periodic AMP reviews, values are restated for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
- Surplus land Surplus land is valued at recoverable amount, taking into account that part of any proceeds to be passed on to customers under Condition B of the Instrument of Appointment.
Grants and other third party contributions Grants, infrastructure charges and other third party contributions received since 31 March 1990 are carried forward to the extent that any balance has not been credited to revenue.
The balance carried forward is restated for the change in the RPI for the year and treated as for deferred income.
Real financial capital maintenance adjustments These adjustments are made to historical cost profit in order to arrive at profit after the maintenance of financial capital in real terms: - Working capital adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening total of trade debtors and stock less trade creditors and the provision for liabilities and charges.
- Financing adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening balance of net finance, which comprises all monetary assets and liabilities in the balance sheet apart from those included in working capital.
Investment in York Waterworks The intangible assets and investments accounting policy on pages 20 and 21 of the accounts outlines the treatment of the transfer of the trade and net assets of The York Waterworks Ltd to Yorkshire Water Services Ltd.
In the regulatory accounts, the investment figure and compensating inter-company creditor of 16.6m have been netted to provide suitable comparisons with the previous year and consistency with the approach agreed with OFWAT.
APPOINTED AND NON-APPOINTED BUSINESS The historical cost accounting information shows separate figures for Appointed and Nonappointed Business.
The Appointed Business is defined to be the regulated activities of the Appointee, i. e. those necessary to fulfil the functions and duties of a water and sewerage undertaker.
The Nonappointed Business encompasses those activities for which Yorkshire Water Services Ltd is not a monopoly supplier or the activity involves the optional use of an asset owned by the Appointed Business.
49 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information 3.
DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSOCIATES Allocation of costs All direct costs are allocated immediately to the activity to which they relate.
Indirect costs and overheads are apportioned on an appropriate basis to reflect the incidence of such costs.
Indirect costs include administrative expenses and the provision of common services.
Direct costs attributable to the provision of services other than the Appointed Business are separately allocated and identified as 'Non-Appointed'.
Indirect costs, relating to nonappointed activities, are recovered as a fixed percentage of direct costs based upon the analysis of operating costs.
Borrowings or sums lent During the year, an amount was lent to the parent company which represented the surplus in funds at 3 month LIBOR rates.
At 31 March 2007, the amount lent was 80.0m.
In addition, 400m was borrowed from the parent company on 31 November 2006 and a further 317m on 30 March 2007, also at 3 month LIBOR rates, following the payment of special dividends of the same amounts to the parent company.
On 31 March 2000, 200m was lent by the parent company, at a fixed rate of 6.875%, repayable in 2010, on 17 April 2000 150m was lent at a fixed rate of 6.625% repayable in 2031, and on November 2001 a further 90m was lent at a fixed rate of 6.625% repayable in 2031.
195.8m has been lent by Yorkshire Water Services Finance Plc, a subsidiary of the company, at a fixed rate of 5.375%, repayable in 2023, 98.7m at 3.048%, repayable in 2033, 125m at 1.462% repayable 2051 and 125m at 1.46% repayable 2056.
No other material sums were lent to or borrowed from other associated companies.
Dividends paid to associated undertakings Amounts paid to the parent company, Kelda Group plc, and the underlying dividend policy are disclosed in the Directors Report on page 9 of these accounts.
Guarantees securities The bankers for Kelda Group current accounts provide an arrangement whereby debit and credit balances are pooled with interest charged on the net group balance.
This facility is subject to provision of cross guarantees by each company within the pooling arrangement, guaranteeing each of the other companies current account liabilities with the bank.
This is provided the net amount of aggregate cleared debit less credit balances must not exceed 20m nor must the aggregate cleared debit balances exceed 25m.
Transfer of assets and liabilities During the course of the year land and buildings were sold to group companies at market value.
Supply of service Details of services supplied to the Appointee by associates during the year are disclosed overleaf where these exceed a materiality level of 1m in line with RAG 5.04 requirements.
No services of a material value were provided by the Appointee to associates.

LINK BETWEEN DIRECTORS PAY AND STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE During 2006 07 remuneration has not been paid or become due to directors as a result of any arrangements which directly link the remuneration of the directors to standards of performance in connection with the carrying out by the company of the functions of a relevant undertaker and no such arrangements were in place.
The remuneration policy of the company, which is set within the context of the groups remuneration policy, is to enable directors to receive remuneration which is positioned in the upper quartile of the market for upper quartile performance, taking into account individual performance, responsibilities and experience.
Accordingly, a significant proportion of directors remuneration is performance related through annual and long term incentive plan awards which may be paid in addition to a base salary.
Under the annual incentive plan, each director has the opportunity to earn an annual incentive award up to a specified percentage of their salary.
Awards are entirely performance related.
At the start of the financial year the board sets challenging financial and operational performance targets.
When determining the actual annual incentive award for each director, the group remuneration committee considers overall business and individual performance taking account of a range of factors including financial performance and standards of performance against regulatory measures.
The amount of any annual incentive award is determined by and at the discretion of the group remuneration committee taking account of and making a judgement in the context of the balance of all matters relevant to overall performance.
The group remuneration committee believes that this is the most appropriate means of aligning directors remuneration to performance.
Awards under the long term incentive plan are based on the total shareholder return over a three year performance period of the group, compared to that of a comparator group of companies including other water and sewerage undertakers whose shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Information on the remuneration of directors is set out on page 23 of the statutory financial statements.

60 Regulatory Operating and Financial Review INTRODUCTION The requirements of the Regulatory Operating and Financial Review are set out in this section and, where noted by cross reference below, in the Business Review and Directors Report that accompany the statutory financial instruments.
The Business Review on page 1 contains a description of the business, its strategy and review of financial and operational performance in the year, together with key performance indicators, based on the statutory accounts.
It also sets out forward-looking statements and the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business.
This review contains additional information and disclosures on regulatory financial information.
The Directors Report in respect of the statutory accounts on page 10 sets out the principal activities of the company, subsequent events and companys policy in respect of employees, employment practices, environment and community matters.
The Regulatory Operating and Financial Review in the Regulatory Accounts is required by Ofwat.
The contents, including the cross-referencing to the statutory financial statements where appropriate, have been prepared following the Accounting Standards Boards Reporting Statement, as supplemented by additional Ofwat requirements.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Key financial performance indicators 2006 2007 Interest cover 2.8x 3.7x Gearing 71.7% 48.7% Net debt to Regulatory Capital Value RCV 60.6% 42.5% Historical cost profit before tax has reduced by 39.3m 18.1% to 177.3m and operating profit has reduced by 24.1m 8.1% to 272.1m since 2005 06.
However this is after charging an exceptional item of 47.0m, described below in atypical items, relating to pensions.
Excluding the impact of this item, profit before tax has increased by 7.7m 3.6% to 224.3m, and operating profit has increased by 22.9m 7.7% to 319.1m.
Total regulated turnover for 2006 07 amounted to 740.9m, an increase of 47.0m 6.8% over the 2005 06 total of 693.9m.
Main charges increased by 6.9% 46.8m over the previous year, primarily as a result of the weighted average charges increase of 7.7%, which included the Ofwat set K factor of 4.9% in addition to RPI.
This was offset by the continuing impact of meter options and economic decline affecting measured consumption.
In total actual income is broadly in line with the level forecast in Ofwats final determination for PR04.
The impact of meter options and lower consumption has been offset by lower than expected trade effluent decline and increases from rechargeable works.
Operating costs have increased by 65.8m to 359.4m, which comprises regulated operating costs of 263.3m, an exceptional item of 47.0m relating to pensions and an infrastructure renewals charge of 49.1m.
Regulated operating costs have increased by 17.3m 7.0% from the 2005 06 figure of 246.0m.
Rising electricity prices have continued to be a major factor, together with the operating cost effect of capital schemes and the impact of general inflation, offset by the delivery of further efficiencies.
The increase of 1.5m in the infrastructure renewals charge reflects the anticipated capital expenditure over the period to 2010.
Depreciation increased by 7.8m, reflecting an increase in base and accelerated depreciation.
61 Regulatory Operating and Financial Review The interest charge of 96.9m is 15.2m higher than 2005 06, of which 7.1m relates to the special dividends of 717.0m described above, which were immediately lent back to YW.
Net debt has increased by 860.7m, or 143.7m excluding the impact of the special dividends, reflecting the continuing significant capital investment programme, which accounts for the rising interest cost.
The current year tax charge of 44.4m has reduced by 7.9m from 2005 06 as it incorporates the tax benefit on the 47m cash contribution to the pension scheme.
The reduction in deferred tax is due to changes in gilt rates affecting the discount rate.
Atypical costs An exceptional cost of 47.0m is included within operating costs which relates to a lump sum contribution of 50m made by the group to reduce its pension scheme deficit.
47.0m of this was paid by Yorkshire Water.
As the company continues to account for pensions on a cash contributions basis, adopting the multi-employer exemption under FRS17, the item is chargeable against profits but has been separately identified as exceptional.
2006 07 included 1.6m of atypical restructuring costs, compared with 1.1m in 2005 06.
Other atypical costs in 2006 07 include 0.3m energy costs relating to wet winter weather affecting raw water quality and 0.1m tankering costs related to the maintenance of rural supplies in dry summer weather conditions.
In addition, waste water tankering costs of 0.2m were incurred following excessive discharges from a local brewery and a further 0.1m associated with cleaning a contaminated sewer.
2005 06 figures included a 1.4m atypical item in respect of 2 mesothelioma claims, where the insurance underwriter is declining to accept liability.
Refunds of Local Authority rates, following successful rating appeals, and related accruals amounted to 0.5m in the year 2006: 2.0m.
Donations to charitable trusts No donations were made by the company to the Community Trust which assists customers with payment difficulties, but was donated by the parent company, Kelda Group plc.
Dividends The total dividend for the year of 826.9m includes 717.0m of special interim dividends paid to Kelda in connection with their proposed return of capital to shareholders.
The final dividend of 2005 06 of 78.0m and 2006 07 interim dividend of 31.9m are also included.
These compare with final and interim dividends of 74.8m and 32.5m respectively in 2005 06, coupled with an efficiency dividend of 161m.

64 Auditors Report on the Regulatory Accounting Information To the Water Services Regulation Authority and Directors of Yorkshire Water Services Limited We have audited the Regulatory Accounts of Yorkshire Water Services Limited the company for the year ended 31 March 2007 which comprise: the regulatory historical cost financial information, itself comprising the regulatory historical cost profit and loss account, the regulatory historical cost balance sheet, the reconciliation between the statutory accounts and the regulatory historical cost financial information and related notes to the regulatory historical cost financial information numbered 1 to 4: and the regulatory current cost financial information, itself comprising the regulatory current cost profit and loss account for the appointed business, the regulatory current cost balance sheet for the appointed business, the regulatory current cost cash flow statement for the appointed business and the related notes to the current cost financial information numbered 1 and 5 to 14.
"This report is made, on terms that have been agreed, solely to the company and the Water Services Regulation Authority ""the WSRA"" in order to meet the requirements of Condition F of the companys Instrument of Appointment granted by the Secretary of State for the Environment to the company as a water and sewerage undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991 the Regulatory Licence."
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company and the WSRA those matters that we have agreed to state to them in our report, in order a to assist the company to meet its obligations under the company's Instrument of Appointment to procure such a report and b to facilitate the carrying out by the WSRA of its regulatory functions, and for no other purpose.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the WSRA, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Basis of preparation The regulatory financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Condition F of the companys Instrument of Appointment as a water undertaker, the Regulatory Accounting Guideline 1.04 Guideline for accounting for current costs and regulatory capital values, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 2.03 Guideline for the classification of expenditure, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 3.06 Guideline for the contents of regulatory accounts and the Regulatory Accounting Guideline 4.03 Guideline for the analysis of operating costs and assets and the accounting policies set out in note 1 and, in the case of the historical cost financial information under the historical cost convention.
The regulatory financial statements are separate from the statutory financial statements of the company.
There are differences between United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP and the basis of preparation of information provided in the regulatory financial statements accounts because the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines 1.04, 2.03, 3.06 and 4.03 specify alternative treatment or disclosure in certain respects.
Where the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines do not specifically address an accounting issue, then they require UK GAAP to be followed.
Financial information other than that prepared wholly on the basis of UK GAAP may not necessarily represent a true and fair view of the financial performance or financial position of a company as shown in financial statements prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
Respective responsibilities of the WSRA, the directors and auditors The nature, form and content of the regulatory financial statements are determined by the WSRA.
It is not appropriate for us to assess whether the nature of the information being reported upon is suitable or appropriate for the WSRA's purposes.
Accordingly we make no assessment.
The Directors' responsibilities for preparing the regulatory financial statements in accordance with the 65 Auditors Report on the Regulatory Accounting Information Regulatory Accounting Guidelines 1.04, 2.03, 3.06 and 4.03 are set out in the Statements of Directors' Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the regulatory financial statements in accordance with International Standards on auditing UK and Ireland, except as stated in the Basis of audit opinion below and having regard to the guidance contained in Audit 05 03 'Reporting to Regulators of Regulated Entities'.
We report our opinion as to whether the regulatory historical cost financial information present fairly, under the historical cost convention, the revenues and costs, assets and liabilities of the appointee and its appointed business in accordance with the company's Instrument of Appointment and Regulatory Accounting Guideline 2.03 Guideline for the classification of expenditure, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 3.06 Guideline for the contents of regulatory accounts and Regulatory Accounting Guideline 4.03 Guideline for the analysis of operating costs and assets : and whether the regulatory current cost financial information have been properly prepared in accordance with Regulatory Accounting Guideline 1.04 Guideline for accounting for current costs and regulatory capital values, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 3.06 and Regulatory Accounting Guideline 4.03.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the company has not kept proper accounting records as required by paragraph 3 of Condition F and whether the information is in agreement with the appointees' accounting records and has been properly prepared in accordance with the requirements of Condition F and, as appropriate, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 1.04, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 2.03, Regulatory Accounting Guideline 3.06, and Regulatory Accounting Guideline 4.03.
We read the other information contained in the regulatory financial information, including any supplementary schedules on which we do not express an audit opinion, and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Regulatory Accounts.
The other information comprises the Regulatory Operating and Financial Review and Other Regulatory Disclosures and Other Regulatory Declarations as required by the Director General of Water Services.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on auditing UK and Ireland issued by the Auditing Practices Board except as noted below.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the regulatory financial statements.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the regulatory financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the company's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the regulatory financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
However, as the nature, form and content of the regulatory financial statements are determined by the WSRA, we did not evaluate the overall adequacy of the presentation of the information, which would have been required if we were to express an audit opinion under Auditing Standards.
Our opinion on the regulatory financial statements is separate from our opinion on the statutory financial statements of the company on which we report, which are prepared for a different purpose.
"Our audit report in relation to the statutory financial statements of the company our ""Statutory"" audit was made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985."
Our Statutory audit work was undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in a Statutory auditors' report and for no other purpose.
In these circumstances, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume any responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our 66 Auditors Report on the Regulatory Accounting Information Statutory audit work, for our Statutory audit report, or for the opinions we have formed in respect of that Statutory audit.
The regulatory historical cost financial information have been drawn up in accordance with Regulatory Accounting Guideline 3.06 in that infrastructure renewals accounting as applied in previous years should continue to be applied and accordingly that the relevant sections of Financial Reporting Standards 12 and 15 be disapplied.
The effect of this departure from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and a reconciliation of the balance sheet drawn up on this basis with that drawn up under Companies Act 1985 is given in the reconciliation between the statutory financial statements and the regulatory historical cost financial information.
Opinion In our opinion the regulatory financial statements of the company for the year ended 31 March 2007 fairly present in accordance with Condition F of the Instrument of Appointment granted by the Secretary of State for the Environment to the company as a water and sewerage undertaker under the Water Industry Act 1991, the Regulatory Accounting Guidelines 1.04, 2.03, 3.06 and 4.03 issued by the WSRA and the accounting policies set out in note 1 to the historical and current cost financial information, the state of the company's affairs at 31 March 2007 on a regulatory historical cost and regulatory current cost basis, the regulatory historical cost and regulatory current cost profit for the year and the regulatory current cost cash flow for the year and have been properly prepared in accordance with those conditions, guidelines and accounting policies.
