Until the liability is settled, it is remeasured at each reporting date with any changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
For awards with market conditions attached, the modelling of the impact of this TSR condition is performed using a Monte Carlo model based on the history of weekly returns of the constituents of the FTSE 250 index.

The measure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share.
For each grant the assumed volatility has been calculated over a period prior to grant commensurate with the expected life of the award.
Adjustments have been made for historic events that are unlikely to recur in the future.

Contingent liabilities The Company has not adopted amendments to FRS 26 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Company does not expect the amendment to have any impact on the financial statements.
