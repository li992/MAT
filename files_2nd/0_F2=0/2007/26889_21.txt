The Company has surplus expenses carried forward of 102.2m 2006 90.1m.
Given the Companys current investment strategy, it is unlikely to generate sufficient UK taxable profits to relieve these expenses.
As at 31 January 2007 there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset, measured at the standard rate of 30%, of 30.7m 2006 27.0m.
This deferred tax asset relates to the current and prior year unutilised expenses.
It is considered unlikely that there will be a liability in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
Therefore, the tax asset has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an approved investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.
