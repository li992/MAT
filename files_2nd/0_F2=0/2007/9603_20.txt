SUBSIDIARY UNDERTAKINGS The Companys direct principal subsidiary undertakings, which are wholly owned, are listed below together with details of their businesses: Class of share Proportion Nature of capital held business Luminar Dancing Finance formerly Luminar Dancing Finance Limited Ordinary 100% Holding Company Luminar Entertainment 2006 Limited Ordinary 100% Holding Company Luminar Dancing 2006 Limited Ordinary 100% Holding Company Unless otherwise stated, all subsidiaries are registered in England and Wales.
Other principal subsidiaries, which the Company indirectly owns, are included in note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES The Company has a 40% interest in the ordinary share capital of Choir IT Limited, a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The investment is accounted for at its historical cost, which is less than 50,000, which accordingly when rounded does not appear in the presentation of these financial statements.
The profit and share capital of the associates is also not material to the Company as a whole.
The Company has a 49% interest in the ordinary share capital of The 3D Entertainment Group Limited.
However, this investment only arises on IFRS due to the different accounting treatment for negative goodwill and therefore the investment is only reported within the consolidated accounts of Luminar plc.
INTERESTS IN JOINT VENTURES During the prior year, the Company entered into an arrangement with Lucien Barriere to form a joint venture company called Waterimage Limited, a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
Both parties own a 50% shareholding in the company, representing one 1 share each.
No trading took place in the company during the year or the prior year.

The use of such derivative financial instruments constitutes an integral part of the Companys funding strategy.
The Company manages its derivative financial instrument credit risk by only undertaking transactions with relationship banks, holding good credit ratings.
Such transactions are governed by Board policies and procedures.
As all the Companys operations are transacted in the reporting currency, there is no currency exposure.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures as their fair value at the year end approximates their carrying value.
INTEREST RATE RISK The Company finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The principal area of financial risk is interest rate risk.
Interest rate risk on borrowings is managed when appropriate by using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.

Non-interest bearing assets are included in the weighted average interest rate calculations.
After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Company in the prior year, the interest rate profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 1 March 2007 was: Floating rate Fixed rate weighted average Fixed Floating weighted Interest Time rate rate Total average rate period m m m %% Years 1 MARCH 2007 237.4 237.4 1.9 2 March 2006 135.0 174.2 309.2 1.2 5.4 0.2 The floating rate debt included above includes 164.1m 2006: 129.2m which is interest free.

C BORROWING FACILITIES The Companys undrawn floating facilities at the balance sheet date were as follows: 1 March 2 March 2007 2006 m m Expiring after two years 116.7 70.0 Following the disposal of the Entertainment Division, a temporary cap was placed on the Companys undrawn floating facilities at 90.0m.
However, since the year end, the facility has been reduced by 100.0m to 90.0m.
Of these facilities, 116.7m 2006: 70.0m is committed and secured by means of a floating charge over the Companys current and future assets.
The floating charge also secures the bank loans drawn down of 73.3m in B above.

There are no interest rate swaps in place at 1 March 2007.
E HEDGES ON FUTURE TRANSACTIONS The Companys policy is to manage interest rate risk by hedging 50% of the bank facility, using interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
However given the low level of drawn down funds during 2007, there is currently no hedging in place.
The position is kept under constant review and suitable arrangements will be put in place when deemed appropriate.

94 Company Financial Statements Luminar plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued For the year ended 1 March 2007 10 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Company has followed the transitional arrangements within FRS 20, Share-based payment, and has adopted the exemption from full retrospective application of all share-based payment awards, and has only applied the measurement requirements of FRS 20 to awards made after 7 November 2002.
However, the following disclosures include all share-based payment awards, therefore including those equity-settled awards granted prior to 7 November 2002.
The Company operates the following share-based payment plans: a Deferred Bonus Plan In March 2004 the shareholders approved the establishment of the Deferred Bonus Plan, the Plan, which seeks to incentivise, retain and reward Executive Directors.
Under the terms of the Plan, 50% of the bonus entitlement of Executive Directors is deferred, being credited to the purchase of notional shares in the Company within the plan.
The earliest vesting of notional shares awarded under the plan is three years after the crediting of the notional holding.
Any dividends accrued on the notional shares are accrued to the benefit of the Executive Directors.
The Company will award matching shares, based on the shareholder return of the Company relative to the FTSE 250 Index over the relevant three year period.
Initial awards will vest after three years and are dependent on the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The settlement of benefits accruing under the Plan is in equity or cash, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Accounting for the plan has assumed that awards will be equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive Director remains in the service of the Company, unless in exceptional circumstances.
b 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme & 1999 Company Share Option Plan Options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are granted to senior employees at the market price of the Companys ordinary shares, determined by the average of the mid-market price of one ordinary share on the three days preceding the date of grant.
The share options are exercisable between three and ten years from the grant date, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance targets and the employee remaining in the service of the Company.
For the 1999 Company Share Option Plan, the options granted require a minimum preexceptional items and pre-tax Earnings Per Share growth of RPI 5% per annum compounded over a three year period.
For the 1996 Executive Share Option Scheme, the options granted in 1998 and 1999, require a minimum pre-exceptional items and pre-tax Earnings Per Share growth of RPI 20% per annum compounded over a three year period.
Options granted from 2000 to 10 July 2002, and from 9 December 2002 to 25 July 2006, require minimum growth of RPI 5% and 3% respectively per annum, compouned over a three year period.
All options granted under the 1996 and 1999 Scheme are equity-settled.
Awards will not vest unless the Executive remains in the service in the Company, unless in exceptional circumstances.
c Northern Leisure 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme Rolled over options Options granted under the Northern Leisure scheme are granted to holders of existing Super Options of Northern Leisure Plc, who have elected to release these in exchange for an equivalent option over Luminar plc shares.
The options vest from three to ten years from grant date of the original Super Options.
All options were granted prior to 7 November 2002 and accordingly are excluded from the scope of FRS 20. d SAYE scheme Options granted under the all-employee Save-As-You-Earn scheme are available to all Executive Directors and employees with over one years service, with options granted at the prevailing market rate, with no discount given on grant.
Options are exercisable three years after the date of grant, with options exercisable for an 18 month period following the earliest vesting date.
If the employee does not withdraw savings from the plan, all options are equity-settled.
e Warrant scheme On 22 February 1999 the shareholders approved the establishment of a discretionary Trust to hold warrants as part of incentive arrangements under which they are subsequently allocated to employees.
Each warrant carried the right to subscribe for one ordinary share at the price of 6.67 per share.
Performance criteria attached to the warrant scheme were met in full in February 2002, and an allocation of 50% of the warrants was made by the Trustee in May 2002.
The remaining warrants are allocable in the absolute discretion of the Trustee who may call for guidance from the Remuneration Committee.
The subscription period in the approved scheme provides that warrants may be exercised in the period of 28 days following the publication of the Annual Report of each financial year up to the year ending on or around 1 March 2009.
More details on the 1999 warrant scheme trust can be found within the Remuneration Report within the Group financial statements on pages 28 to 35. f Jools Holland The options granted were exercisable five years after the date of grant, and were exercisable for a six month period thereafter, if Mr Holland was still involved with the Company and the Jam House brand at vesting date.
The options lapsed on 2 January 2007.
Luminar plc 95 Company Financial Statements Annual Report 2007 10 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued g Restricted share award In July 2006, the Remuneration Committee made a one-off retention award of 47,900 restricted shares to Nick Beighton, the Finance Director.
This grant was made in recognition of the fact that no share options or performance shares had been granted to Mr Beighton on or since his appointment in August 2005, due to the delayed implementation of the new long-term incentive plan.
Furthermore, it was felt that Mr Beighton had performed at an exceptional level since his appointment and that he was instrumental in completing the successful reorganisation of the business in 2006.
The strategic, one-off grant of restricted shares was deemed necessary to secure his retention during this critical period and was made under the terms of paragraph 9.4.
The shares will vest 50% in July 2007 and 50% in July 2008, subject to his continued employment with Luminar.
Awards will vest early in the event of a change of control.
h One-off Phantom Long-term Incentive Award to the Chairman In order to secure the services of Alan Jackson as Chairman, the Remuneration Committee considered it necessary to offer a one-off cash award over 73,314 notional shares, granted under Listing Rule 9.4.
Vesting of the Phantom Award is based on the Groups TSR performance over a three year vesting period.
40% of the Phantom Award will vest if Luminars TSR is equal to the TSR of the median company.
The Phantom Award will vest in full if Luminars TSR is equal to or above the TSR of the upper quartile company.
Straight-line vesting will occur between these points.
TSR values will be the average over the three months prior to the beginning and end of the performance period.
In the event of a change of control or if Mr Jackson leaves in certain compassionate circumstances, performance will be measured over the shorter period and awards will be scaled back on a time pro-rata basis.
