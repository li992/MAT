The Share Option Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 55.
The Share Save Scheme The extent, nature, term and general terms and conditions, including vesting, relating to this arrangement, are also detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 52.
The Share Option and Share Save Scheme are considered to be equity-settled transactions, and for all awards post 7 November 2002, require to be fair valued at the date of award.
The fair value process and the underlying assumptions used are described below.
Based on the results of this actuarial review, the Share Save Scheme was demonstrated to be immaterial and accordingly the requirements of IFRS 2 share based payment, are not applied to this arrangement.
The Phantom Option Scheme Senior managers excluding Directors, participate in this arrangement, which mirrors the terms and conditionality of the Share Option Scheme, except that on exercise they are cash-settled transactions.
As such, these transactions also require to be fair valued, but at each reporting date.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of movements in the respective option schemes.

These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.

The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 2.0625 4.135 2006: 2.0625 4.135.
For the two awards of share options post 7 November 2002 January 2003 and December 2004, the Company was assisted in the process of establishing the fair value at the date of the grant of the awards by CPRM, a professional actuarial firm, and part of the Cavanagh Group.
CPRM estimated the fair value using a binomial model, utilising a risk free discount rate and taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted, and the performance conditions that were required to be satisfied before vesting.
The risk free discount rate is a measure of the guaranteed returns that could be earned in the market over a given term at the valuation date.
In line with IFRS 2 requirements, this has been set as the yield on a zero coupon government bond with a remaining term equal to the expected term on the option being valued, allowing for expected early redemption of the option.
CPRM were also provided with the detailed rules of each scheme and all the objective data relating to historic awards grants, exercises, lapses, withdrawals etc as well as the Companys historic daily share price and staff turnover analysis.
In addition, the following assumptions were also made with respect to the expected volatility of the Companys share price and the expected life of an option.
For volatility, the Company used share price data from 2002 onwards.
This was the year the Company acquired 4 new producing development assets in the North Sea, which were transforming to the Company, and which significantly reduced the influence of the historic Russian activity on the Company.
This geographical shift has lead to a lower volatility in the Companys share price which is expected to continue into the future.
CPRM were able to corroborate this fact by establishing that the standard deviation of the Companys share price the measure of volatility from the FTSE All Share Index throughout the historic period, reduced considerably from 2002 onwards.
Accordingly, an annual volatility assumption of 34% was utilised.
The life of the option depends on the trigger levels at which employees decide to exercise before the option expires and the extent to which option holders withdraw from the schemes due to staff turnover or mortality.
Due to the small number of members included in the Dana schemes, the results of any historic analysis are very sensitive to personal circumstances at the time of exercise and therefore the results are not representative nor an appropriate profile to extrapolate into the future.
