QinetiQ Group plc 69 Annual Report 2007 Business combinations Intangible assets recognised on business combinations have been valued using established methods and models to determine estimated value and useful economic life, with input, where appropriate, from external valuation consultants.
Such methods require the use of estimates which may produce results that are different from actual future outcomes.
The Group tests annually whether goodwill and identified intangible assets have suffered any impairment.
This process is reliant on the use of estimates of the future profitability and cash flows of its cash generating units which may differ from the actual results delivered.
Post-retirement benefits The Groups defined benefit pension obligations and net income statement costs are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality, inflation and future salary and pension increases.
Management exercise their best judgement, in consultation with actuarial advisers, in selecting the values for these assumptions that are the most appropriate to the Group.
Small changes in these assumptions, individually or collectively, may result in significant changes in the size of the deficit or the net income statement costs.
Research and development expenditure Internally-funded development expenditure is capitalised when criteria are met and is written off over the forecast period of sales resulting from the development.
Management decides upon the adequacy of future demand and market for such new products in order to justify capitalisation of internally-funded development expenditure, which can be difficult to determine when dealing with such innovative technologies.
Actual product sales may differ from these estimates.
Income taxes In determining the Groups provisions for income tax and deferred tax it is necessary to consider transactions in a small number of key tax jurisdictions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
To the extent that the final outcome differs from the tax that has been provided, adjustments will be made to income tax and deferred tax provisions held in the period the determination is made.
Unquoted equity investments The Group usually judges the fair value of unquoted equity investments using the valuation ascribed to the investment by a third party funding round or similar valuation event for that investment.
In determining the value of an investment the Group may use information from funding rounds, business plans and forecasts, market projections and other estimation techniques as a guide.
These valuation techniques require estimates of the business future performance.
The actual business performance of investments may differ from these estimates.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For the year ended 31 March 2006 this is presented on an adjusted basis to reflect the share restructuring that took place at IPO.
For diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares arising from share options granted.
Underlying earnings per share figures are presented below, as the Directors believe this to be a good measure of recurring business performance.
Underlying earnings per share reflect adjustments for the impact of non-recurring and other items on basic earnings per share.

Goodwill at 31 March 2007 was allocated to cash generating units CGUs including Apogen 124.9m, Analex 77.4m, FMI 57.3m, Westar 52.6m, OSEC 20.6m and PSI 15.0m.
No other allocations of goodwill are considered significant to the Groups total goodwill.
The Group tests goodwill for impairment annually and uses value in use as the recoverable amount.
The Group has made a number of assumptions in determining the value in use of goodwill allocated to a cash generating unit.
It is assumed that cash generating units perform to the five-year corporate plan.
This is consistent with the current and prior performance of the cash generating units and current UK and US defence and security spending forecasts.
The estimates of the long-term growth rates for the CGUs is based on macro economic assumptions and does not exceed the long-term estimate for the sectors in which CGUs operate.
The Group has assumed that effective tax rates continue after allowing for stated tax rate changes.
Future cash flows have been discounted at a post tax discount rate of 8%.
Sensitivity analysis has indicated that no reasonably foreseeable changes in the key assumptions in the impairment model would result in significant impairment charges being recorded in the financial statements.

From the date of acquisition to 31 March 2007 Analex has contributed revenue of 4.3m and an operating profit of 0.6m.
Other acquisitions and disposals in year to 31 March 2007 On 3 May 2006 the Group purchased the remaining 19.9% minority interest in Aurix Limited for nil consideration resulting in goodwill on acquisition of 2.0m.

These adjustments followed the finalisation of the estimated deferred tax made at the time of the acquisitions.
On 28 February 2007 Aerospace Filtration Systems, Inc. was sold to Donaldson, Inc. for 19.9m $39.0m resulting in a profit on disposal of 9.9m $19.4m.

Update in respect of acquisitions made in the year ended 31 March 2006 At the date of acquisition of Planning Systems, Inc. provision was made for additional consideration payable on the achievement of certain performance criteria in the 12 months ended 31 December 2005 of 0.9m and 0.8m for the performance criteria in the 12 months to 31 December 2006.
The performance criteria for the 12 months to December 2005 was paid in full, however the criteria for the 12 months to 31 December 2006 were not met and consequently the accrual was released resulting in a reduction in goodwill of 0.8m in the year to 31 March 2007.

The previously estimated fair value of assets and liabilities on the acquisitions of Apogen, Inc. Planning Systems, Inc. and SimAuthor, Inc. were finalised during the year.
The goodwill on the SimAuthor acquisition was reduced by 0.7m $1.3m as the previously estimated fair value of intangibles was finalised following receipt of an external valuation report partially offset by a 0.4m $0.7m increase in deferred tax liabilities.
The Group recognised 0.5m $1.0m of additional goodwill on the acquisition of Apogen on finalisation of deferred tax liabilities.

Share-based payments The Group operates a number of share-based payment plans for employees: 2003 employee share option scheme Under the employee share option scheme all employees as at 25 July 2003 received share options which vested when the Group completed its IPO and which must be exercised within 10 years of grant.
The options are settled by shares.
2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average average exercise exercise Number price Number price Outstanding at start of year 12,121,644 2.3p 295,880 100.0p Forfeited in year before bonus issue 5,200 100.0p Bonus issue in year 42.55 new shares for each 1 share 12,077,754 100.0p Forfeited in year after bonus issue 275,724 2.3p 11,914 2.3p Exercised in year after bonus issue 10,120,092 2.3p 234,876 2.3p Outstanding and exercisable at end of year 1,725,828 2.3p 12,121,644 2.3p Options outstanding at 31 March 2007 had an average remaining life of 6.3 years 31 March 2006: 7.3 years.
The average share price in year was 185p.
Group Share Incentive Plan Under the QinetiQ Share Incentive Plan the Group offers UK employees the option of purchasing up to 125 a month of shares at the prevailing market rate.
The Group will make a matching contribution of a third of the employees payment.
The Groups matching contribution may be forfeited if the employee ceases to be employed by QinetiQ within three years of the award of the shares.
Group Share Option Scheme In the year the Group granted options to certain employees under the Group Share Option Scheme.
The exercise price of the options is the average market price of the Groups shares on the date of the grant.
The options vest after three years.
For 10,382,585 2006: 217,805 of the options the number that will vest is dependent upon the growth of earnings per share EPS over the measurement period.
25% of options will vest if EPS growth is 22.5% for the period and 100% will vest if growth is at least 52%.
No options will vest if EPS growth is below 22.5%.
Options will vest on a straight line basis if EPS growth is between 22.5% and 52%.
For the remaining 160,112 options the EPS growth target is replaced by a performance target based on QinetiQs ranking by reference to total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group comprising the FTSE 250 companies over a three-year performance period such that a below median ranking will result in nil shares vesting, at the median level 30% of the options would vest and the amount vested will increase on a straight line basis such that 100% would vest if TSR reaches the upper quartile of the ranking over a three-year period.

QinetiQ Group plc 98 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 34.
Share-based payments continued Option pricing Share-based payments have been valued using a binomial option pricing model.
Assumptions used within the model include expected volatility of 35%, an expected life of three years and a risk free rate of return of 3.78% and for the 2003 Share Option Plan options, a pre-bonus issue-weighted average share price of 1 and a weighted average exercise price of 1 based on third-party transactions in the Companys shares in the period immediately prior to the issue of the share options.
Prior to IPO there was no active market for the Companys shares therefore expected volatility was determined using the average volatility for a comparable selection of businesses.
The Group had no established pattern of dividend payments therefore no dividends were assumed in this model.
The total share-based payment expense in the period was 1.1m year to 31 March 2006: 0.1m.
Operating leases Group as a lessor The Group receives rental income on certain properties.
The Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments: all figures in million 2007 2006 Within one year 5.4 4.3 In the second to fifth years inclusive 4.6 2.5 Greater than five years 2.2 2.6 12.2 9.4 Group as a lessee all figures in million 2007 2006 Lease and sublease income statement expense minimum lease payments 12.2 10.9 The Group had the following future minimum lease payment commitments: all figures in million 2007 2006 Within one year 18.0 9.6 In the second to fifth years inclusive 31.2 19.0 Greater than five years 13.7 10.0 62.9 38.6 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group on certain office property and plant.
Leases are negotiated for an average of three to ten years.
QinetiQ Group plc 99 Annual Report 2007 36.
Transactions with the MOD The MOD is a 18.9% 2006: 19.2% shareholder in the Group.
Detailed below are the agreements that have been entered into and the trading that has taken place with the MOD.
Trading The MOD is a major customer of the Group.
An analysis of trading with the MOD is presented below: all figures in million 2007 2006 Sales to the MOD excluding property rental income 584.5 595.8 Property rental income 6.8 9.1 Total income from the MOD 591.3 604.9 Purchased services from the MOD 12.4 17.8 all figures in million 2007 2006 Trade debtors 81.3 72.6 Trade creditors 0.1 0.3 Freehold land and buildings and surplus properties Under the terms of the Groups acquisition of part of the business and certain assets of DERA from the MOD on 1 July 2001, the MOD retained certain rights in respect of the freehold land and buildings transferred.
These are: i Restrictions on transfer of title The title deeds of those properties with strategic assets see below or properties where strategic assets are in the course of being downgraded to becoming non-strategic include a clause that prevents their transfer without the approval of MOD.
The MOD also has the right to purchase any strategic assets in certain circumstances.
ii Property clawback agreement The MOD retains an interest in future profits on disposal following a trigger event.
A trigger event includes the granting of planning permission for development and or change of use, and the disposition of any of the acquired land and buildings.
During the 12 years from 1 July 2001, following a trigger event, the MOD is entitled to clawback a proportion of the gain on each individual property transaction in excess of a 30% gain on a July 2001 professional valuation.
The proportion of the excess gain due to the MOD is based on a sliding scale which reduces over time from 50% to 9% and at 31 March 2007 stands at 41%.
The July 2001 valuation was approximately 16% greater in aggregate than the consideration paid for the land and buildings on 1 July 2001.
Compliance Regime The Compliance Committee monitors the effective application of the Compliance Regime required by the MOD to maintain the position of QinetiQ as a supplier of independent and impartial scientific technical advice to the MOD and ensures that the required standards are met in trials involving human volunteers and trials where an incident may result in serious injury.
Strategic assets Under the Principal Agreement with the MOD, the QinetiQ controlled Group is not permitted without the written consent of the MOD, to: i dispose of or destroy all or any part of a strategic asset: or ii voluntarily undertake any closure of, or cease to provide a strategic capability by means of, all or any part of a strategic asset.
The net book value of assets identified as being strategic assets as at 31 March 2007 was 3.1m 31 March 2006: 3.4m, the principal items being plant and machinery.
Long-Term Partnering Agreement On 27 February 2003 QinetiQ Limited entered into a Long-Term Partnering Agreement to provide the Test and Evaluation T&E facilities and training support services to the MOD.
This is a 25-year contract with a total revenue value of up to 5.6bn, dependent on the level of usage by MOD, under which QinetiQ Limited is committed to providing the T&E services with increasing efficiencies through cost saving and innovative service delivery.

Directors and other senior management personnel The Directors and other senior management personnel of the Group during the year to 31 March 2007 comprise the Board of Directors and the QinetiQ Executive Committee.

Contingent liabilities and assets Subsidiary undertakings within the Group have given unsecured guarantees of 2.0m at 31 March 2007 31 March 2006: 2.8m in the ordinary course of business.
The Group is aware of claims and potential claims by or on behalf of current and former employees, including former employees of the MOD and DERA and contractors, in respect of intellectual property, employment rights and industrial illness and injury which involve or may involve legal proceedings against the Group.
The Directors are of the opinion, having regard to legal advice received, the Groups insurance arrangements and provisions carried in the balance sheet, that it is unlikely that these matters will, in aggregate, have a material effect on the Groups financial position, results of operations and liquidity.
The Group has not recognised contingent amounts receivable relating to the Chertsey property which was disposed of during 2004 or the Fort Halstead property disposed of in September 2005.
Additional consideration, subject to clawback to the MOD pursuant to the arrangements referred to in note 36, is potentially due upon the purchasers obtaining additional planning consents, with the quantum dependent on the scope of the consent achieved.
QinetiQ Group plc 101 Annual Report 2007 39.
Post-retirement benefits Introduction and background to IAS 19 International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits requires the Group to include in the balance sheet the surplus or deficit on defined benefit schemes calculated as at the balance sheet date.
It is a snapshot view which can be significantly influenced by short-term market factors.
The calculation of the surplus or deficit is, therefore, dependent on factors which are beyond the control of the Group principally the value at the balance sheet date of equity shares in which the scheme has invested and long-term interest rates which are used to discount future liabilities.
The funding of the scheme is based on long-term trends and assumptions relating to market growth, as advised by qualified actuaries.
The QinetiQ Pension Scheme In the UK the Group operates the QinetiQ Pension Scheme for the majority of its UK employees, a mixed benefit scheme.
The Defined Benefit DB section of the scheme provides future service pension benefits to transferring Civil Service employees.
All Group employees who were members, or eligible to be members, of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme or the UKAEA principal Non-Industrial Superannuation Scheme were invited to join the DB section of the scheme from 1 July 2001, together with all new employees who were previously members of schemes who are part of the Public Sector Transfer Club.
The Defined Contribution DC section of the scheme was set up for all employees who were not eligible or did not wish to join the DB section of the scheme.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the DB section was undertaken as at 31 March 2005 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 106.5m.
On the basis of the 31 March 2005 full valuation the Trustees of the scheme and the Company agreed that the 17.5% employer contribution rate would continue and in addition a further 10.0m per annum cash payment would be paid monthly for six years from October 2005, subject to review at the next valuation, due in March 2008, to cover the past service deficit.
Subsequently the Company agreed that part of the IPO proceeds would be used to prepay the balance of the first five years of the additional funding and a 45m payment was made into the scheme on 30 March 2006.
The Company also made a further 45.3m payment into the scheme on the same date following the receipt of the payment from the MOD of the same value that was received in March 2006 in accordance with the indemnity given by the MOD to the Company as part of the agreement dated 3 December 2002 whereby QinetiQ Group plc acquired QinetiQ Holdings Limited.
There were no additional employer contributions in the year to 31 March 2007.
Other UK schemes In the UK the Group operates a further three small defined benefit schemes, QinetiQ Prudential Platinum Scheme and schemes for the subsidiary companies ASAP Calibration Limited and Aurix Limited.
The net pension deficits of these schemes at 31 March 2007 amounted to 0.3m 31 March 2006: 0.3m.
During the year the defined benefit scheme relating to ASAP Calibration Limited was closed to future benefit accruals.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date 31 March 2006: nil.
Set out below is a summary of the overall IAS 19 defined benefit pension schemes liabilities.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods, and thus inherently uncertain, were: 2004 all figures in million 2007 2006 2005 UKGAAP Equities 641.5 551.1 361.6 286.7 Corporate bonds 74.5 85.2 44.4 38.6 Government bonds 74.7 74.8 45.7 50.2 Cash 3.4 4.9 2.4 4.4 Total market value of assets 794.1 716.0 454.1 379.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 884.9 884.4 617.2 525.3 Net pension liability before deferred tax 90.8 168.4 163.1 145.4 Deferred tax asset 27.1 50.4 48.8 30.1 Net pension liability 63.7 118.0 114.3 115.3 2004 figures have been extracted from the UK GAAP results of the Group as no IFRS Group accounts were prepared in that year.
QinetiQ Group plc 102 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 39.
Post-retirement benefits continued Assumptions The major assumptions weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1% 2.9% Rate of increase in pensions in deferment 3.1% 2.9% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.4% 4.9% Inflation assumption 3.1% 2.9% Mortality assumption in years Future male pensioners 86 86 Future female pensioners 89 89 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
It is important to note that these assumptions are long term, and in the case of the discount rate and the inflation rate are measured by external market indicators.
Assumptions for mortality for the year to 31 March 2007 have been maintained at the previous year levels and are in line with the mortality tables PMA92SC for males and PFA92SC for females as published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation and adopted by the actuarial profession.
Scheme assets Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets weighted to reflect individual scheme differences were: 2007 2006 Equities 7.70% 7.70% Corporate bonds 5.30% 4.70% Government bonds 4.60% 4.10% Cash 5.50% 4.50% Weighted average 7.20% 6.90% all figures in million 2007 2006 Actual return on plan assets: Expected return on scheme assets 50.4 34.1 Actuarial gain on scheme assets 1.5 85.8 Actual return on scheme assets 51.9 119.9 all figures in million 2007 2006 Changes to the fair value of scheme assets: Opening fair value of scheme assets 716.0 454.1 Actual return on assets 51.9 119.9 Contributions by the employer 39.4 149.2 Contributions by plan participants 5.6 4.6 Net benefits paid out 18.8 11.8 Closing fair value of scheme assets 794.1 716.0 QinetiQ Group plc 103 Annual Report 2007 all figures in million 2007 2006 Changes to the present value of the defined benefit obligation: Opening defined benefit obligation 884.4 617.2 Current service cost 47.7 40.1 Interest cost 44.3 34.4 Contributions by plan participants 5.6 4.6 Actuarial gains losses on scheme liabilities 84.3 193.5 Net benefits paid out 18.9 11.8 Curtailments 6.1 6.4 Closing defined benefit obligation 884.9 884.4 all figures in million 2007 2006 Pension costs charged to the income statement: Current service cost 47.7 40.1 Interest cost 44.3 34.4 Expected return on plan assets 50.4 34.1 Curtailment cost 6.1 Total expense recognised in the income statement gross of deferred tax 47.7 40.4 In the year to 31 March 2006 6.4m of curtailment payments were provided for in the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 as part of the Groups restructuring costs.

The expected employer cash contribution to the defined benefit scheme for the year ending 31 March 2008 is 31.2m.
Defined contribution schemes Payments to the defined contribution schemes totalled 13.3m March 2006: 7.9m.
QinetiQ Group plc 104 Annual Report 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 40.
Restatement of prior year comparatives IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires the Group to finalise the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired from business combinations within one year of the acquisition date except certain deferred tax balances.
During the year the Group was required to adjust goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax balances upon finalisation of the fair value of assets and liabilities on the acquisitions of Apogen Technologies Inc. Planning Systems Inc. and SimAuthor, Inc.
These balances have been restated in the prior year comparatives as follows: 2006 2006 2006 all figures in million As reported Adjustment Restated Goodwill 315.0 0.1 314.9 Intangible assets 56.4 0.7 57.1 Deferred tax asset 12.4 0.6 11.8 Other net liabilities not restated 20.9 20.9 Net assets 362.9 362.9 41.

Post balance sheet events On 16 April 2007 the Group acquired ITS Corporation ITS for an initial cash consideration of 40.8m $80.0m.
The agreement to purchase ITS includes an additional deferred payment of 5.1m $10.0m based on the achievement of certain short-term performance milestones.
ITS had revenues of 39.5m $77.5m for the 12 months ended 31 December 2006, EBITDA of 3.3m $6.4m, and reported operating profit of 3.1m $6.0m, after charging 0.6m $1.2m of non-recurring costs related to acquisitions completed in late 2005.
On 23 April 2007 the Group announced that it had agreed to purchase all the shares of Applied Perception, Inc. API and Automatika, Inc. Automatika, both providers of robotics technologies, for up to 4.7m $9.2m each.
