Exceptional items and amortisation Exceptional items and amortisation are excluded from underlying results in order to provide a better understanding of the normalised trading of the Group, and include operating exceptional items and amortisation and finance exceptional items.
The Group has responded to the unprecedented decline in the global markets for physical product by implementing a series of strategic remedies.
The cost of these remedies in accounting terms is as reported below.
Amongst the strategic remedies are headcount and roster reductions and a change in estimating methodology for advances.
Certain other transactions are reported below because they fall within the Groups definition of Exceptional items and amortisation as per the accounting policies section of the financial statements.

Earnings per Ordinary share 2007 2006 Earnings loss per Ordinary share is calculated using the following: Earnings 288.5 m 86.1m Underlying earnings 46.2m 127.4m Basic Weighted average number of Ordinary shares 794.8m 786.8m Diluted Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 794.8m 874.2m Diluted underlying Adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares 802.4m 874.2m The adjusted weighted average number of Ordinary shares used in the diluted underlying earnings per share calculations, 802.4m 2006: 874.2m, is the weighted average number of Ordinary shares, 794.8m 2006: 786.8m adjusted by the effects of dilutive share options, 7.6m 2006: 8.5m.
The number of Ordinary shares arising from the conversion of convertible bond options, 78.9m 2006: 78.9m, is not included in the calculation of the diluted underlying earnings per share because of its anti-dilutive effect.
However, it was included in the calculation of the diluted earnings per share calculation in 2006 because of its dilutive effect.
It is also excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2007 because it is anti-dilutive.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to each individual cash generating unit CGU, which reflects how it is monitored for internal management purposes.
No individual goodwill balance is significant compared to total Group goodwill except for the goodwill held in the Music UK CGU of 16.1m 2006: 15.0m.
Of the 28.9m total held on the balance sheet at 31 March 2007, 16.1m relates to a CGU in Music UK and 0.7m to a CGU in Music North America.
These balances are supported on the basis of fair value market price less costs of sale.
The remainder of the total balance relates to a number of smaller investments which are assessed for recoverability by comparing the value in use, based on cash flow projections discounted at a risk-free discount rate, with the carrying amount.
The cash flow projections are risk-adjusted whilst the discount rates used reflect the region in which the asset is located and the life of the asset.
We do not believe there is a likelihood that a reasonably possible change in any key assumption made would result in an impairment being required.
No component of the total amount impaired in the year of 14.0m is individually material.

At 31 March 2007 this embedded call feature had a fair value of 9.1m 2006: 30.3m and is included as a financial asset.
Financial liabilities 2007 2006 m m Non-current US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes 252.0 287.7 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 324.0 323.1 US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bonds 109.4 121.1 425m 8.625% senior notes 280.1 300.0 Long-term committed facilities term loan 245.3 1.5 Term loan 2.0 1,210.8 1,032.4 Finance leases Note 20 15.8 17.0 Interest rate swaps 8.8 13.6 Convertible bond derivative 81.6 86.7 1,317.0 1,149.7 Current Overdrafts 9.5 19.6 Forward currency contracts 1.5 Term loan 1.2 Finance leases Note 20 1.3 1.8 12.3 22.6 Total financial liabilities 1,329.3 1,172.3 Includes issue costs of syndicated loan facility of 14.7m 2006: 1.5m.
Financial liabilities continued Interest rate swaps The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2007 were 542.9m 2006: 586.2m.
At 31 March 2007 the fixed interest rates vary from 8.38% to 8.63% 2006: 8.38% to 8.63% and the main floating rates are 3 month LIBOR 465 basis points and 3 month EURIBOR 440 basis points 2006: 3 month LIBOR 465 basis points and 3 month EURIBOR 440 basis points.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is equal to the book value.
Convertible bond The US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bonds which were issued in October 2003 are repayable in October 2010.
The bonds are convertible into US$1,000 Preference shares of the issuer which will be exchangeable immediately upon issue for Ordinary shares in the Company.
The number of Ordinary shares for which a Preference share may be exchanged will be determined by dividing the paid-up value of the Preference share, translated into Sterling at the fixed rate of US$1.5957, by the exchange price initially set at 193.38p per Ordinary share.
Conversion by the holder at 193.38p per Ordinary share may occur after 11 November 2003 until seven days prior to the final redemption date.
Conversion by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, of all but not part, may occur if the average price per Ordinary share on at least 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days has been 130p: or at any time if 85% or more of the aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the holder, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same conditions which apply to conversion by the issuer are met.
Final redemption is on 2 October 2010 at 100% of principal and accrued interest.
Convertible bond derivative On issue of the guaranteed convertible bond, the fair value of the liability component was determined using a market rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond.
As the convertible bond was denominated in US Dollars but convertible into Sterling shares, the remainder of the proceeds were allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included as a derivative liability, net of issue costs.
The value of the call feature is revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date, with movements in the fair value reflected as finance costs or finance income.
Forward currency contract In December 2006 the Company entered into an agreement to purchase Toshibas 45% minority interest in its subsidiary, Toshiba-EMI Limited.
Given the Groups policy not to hedge trading transaction exposure apart from materially large one-off items that have a high degree of certainty of occurring, this large firm commitment was hedged by means of a forward currency contract.
Revolving credit facilities In March 2007 the Group replaced its existing 450m revolving credit facility with a new 700m credit facility due 29 May 2009.
The new credit facility also provides the financing for the purchase of the TOEMI minority and the costs associated with the restructuring project.
This resulted in exceptional refinancing costs of 1.1m 2006: 5.2m in respect of the write off of issue costs of the 450m revolving credit facility.
Borrowings under the new 700m credit facility are governed by certain financial covenants based on the results and financial position of the Group, including the requirement that the interest coverage ratio and the leverage ratio each as defined in the credit agreement remain within certain limits.
The covenants are tested, for the prior twelve month period as appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
The Group is currently in compliance with both covenants.
The new 700m credit facility has two tranches, a 400m term loan facility and a 300m revolving credit facility.
The term loan of 245.3m was drawn under the new credit facility in March 2007 2006: July 2004 to December 2005.
One single repayment will be made in May 2009.
The loan carries a floating rate of interest, whose margin over LIBOR is determined by a leverage ratio grid net borrowings EBITDA as defined in the credit facility, currently set at LIBOR 2.5%.
In March 2006 there was a term loan of 3.2m drawn under a separate facility which was repaid and cancelled during the year.
Other financial liabilities On 11 March 2003 Moodys Investor Service downgraded the Groups credit rating from Baa2 to Ba1.
As a consequence the coupon of the 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds was increased from 8.25% to 9.75% with effect from 20 May 2003.
At 31 March 2007 the Group had available 452.3m 2006: 437.1m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
All the Groups financial liabilities excluding finance leases are unsecured.
For details regarding the Groups obligations under finance leases, see Note 20.

Short-term deposits are ordinarily made for periods varying between one day and one month, although can extend to periods of up to three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
The Group has balances of cash and cash equivalents totalling 220.9m 2006: 60.7m held with banks within the UK and 110.8m 2006: 130.2m held with banks outside, but freely transferable to, the UK.
Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies is set out in the discussion of Treasury policies in Section 7: Financial Review in the Group Operating and Financial Review.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group are as follows: Year ended 31 March 2007 Current Effective Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years More than coupon rate interest rate 5 years Total m m m m m m m Fixed rate US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes 8.375% 8.49% 252.0 252.0 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 9.75% 9.92% 324.0 324.0 US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bonds 5.25% 9.30% 109.4 109.4 425m 8.625% senior notes 8.625% 8.94% 280.1 280.1 Finance leases 1.3 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 10.0 17.1 1.3 325.3 253.4 110.9 1.6 290.1 982.6 Floating rate Overdrafts 9.5 9.5 Term loan 245.3 245.3 Interest rate swaps 7.4 1.4 8.8 Forward currency contract 1.5 1.5 11.0 252.7 1.4 265.1 Year ended 31 March 2006 Current Effective Within 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years More than coupon rate interest rate 5 years Total m m m m m m m Fixed rate US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes 8.375% 8.49% 287.7 287.7 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 9.75% 9.92% 323.1 323.1 US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bonds 5.25% 9.30% 121.1 121.1 425m 8.625% senior notes 8.625% 8.94% 300.0 300.0 Long-term committed facilities 1.5 1.5 Finance leases 1.8 1.8 1.9 1.9 1.6 9.8 18.8 1.8 1.8 325.0 289.6 121.2 309.8 1,049.2 Floating rate Overdrafts 19.6 19.6 Term loan 1.2 2.0 3.2 Interest rate swaps 13.6 13.6 20.8 2.0 13.6 36.4 Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts.
Such an allowance is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the debt.
The credit risk on bank balances is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of geographically dispersed counterparties.
Net Investment in foreign operations During the year the Group borrowed Japanese Yen totalling JPY 22,300m with a carrying value of 107.1m.
In March 2007 all of these borrowings were repaid.
In April 2006 borrowings of JPY 11,500m 55.8m were designated as a hedge of the Groups net investment in its Japanese subsidiaries, hedging the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on these investments.
Upon repayment in March 2007, the borrowings were dedesignated as a hedge and the gain on retranslation of the borrowing was transferred to equity to offset the loss on translation of the net investment in the Japanese subsidiaries, whilst the translation gain on the remaining borrowings 3.0m was immediately recognised in profit and loss finance exceptional items.

Financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value of publicly traded borrowings has been calculated using the appropriate market prices at the balance sheet date.
For the borrowings which are not publicly traded, the fair value has been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at the appropriate market rate.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be as follows: Book value Fair value 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Financial assets Held-to-maturity investments 3.2 7.9 3.2 7.9 Available-for-sale investments 7.8 7.1 7.8 7.1 Interest rate swaps 11.0 11.0 425m 8.625% senior notes embedded call feature 9.1 30.3 9.1 30.3 Investments at fair value through profit and loss 0.2 0.3 0.2 0.3 20.3 56.6 20.3 56.6 Financial liabilities Loans and overdrafts 9.5 19.6 9.5 19.6 US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes 252.0 287.7 266.0 306.0 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 324.0 323.1 337.1 348.0 US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bonds 109.4 121.1 119.4 133.5 425m 8.625% senior notes 280.1 300.0 323.9 368.1 Long-term committed facilities 1.5 1.5 Term loan 245.3 3.2 245.3 3.2 Finance leases 17.1 18.8 17.1 18.8 Interest rate swaps 8.8 13.6 8.8 13.6 Foreign currency contract 1.5 1.5 Convertible bond derivative 81.6 86.7 81.6 86.7 1,329.3 1,172.3 1,410.2 1,296.0 Fair value hedges The Group holds equivalent US Dollar nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon and the term of the US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes effectively converting the interest basis of the issue to floating rate set in arrears.

From 1 April 2006, this swap was dedesignated as a hedge for hedge accounting purposes.
The Group holds equivalent Euro nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon and the term of the 425m 8.625% senior notes effectively converting the interest basis of the issue to floating rate set in arrears.

The lease runs for a term of 15 years, although the Group has the option to repurchase the property at any time between years five and 12.
If the Group opts not to take up this option, then ownership of the property will revert to the lessor at the end of the lease.
The rentals payable under the lease, along with the premium payable should the Group take up the option to repurchase, are set out in the lease agreement.

Deferred taxation continued Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for balance sheet purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax liabilities 3.7 5.1 Deferred tax assets 12.0 22.8 At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of 665.0m 2006: 441.5m available for offset against future profits.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the 665.0m 2006: 441.5m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in the unrecognised tax losses are losses of 93.3m 2006: 51.7m that will expire in 2027.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date the Group had net other deductible temporary differences of 52.0m 2006: 54.6m.
No deferred tax has been recognised due to unpredictability of future profit streams.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled operations are insignificant.

They also include restructuring and reorganisation provisions charged through operating exceptional items Note 8.
Employee benefits This provision relates to long term benefits and termination benefits.
Disposal and fundamental reorganisation This provision relates to the reorganisation costs for the closure and or sale of EMIs manufacturing businesses in North America and Europe.
Acquisition and integration This provision relates to acquisition and integration costs that were created for earnouts.
Earnouts are contractual commitments under which the seller of a business is entitled to additional future compensation if the acquired business achieves certain future financial targets.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The nature of the scheme in a particular country is usually in line with local custom and practice and is supportive of, and a key element of, the Groups overall human resources strategy.
This operational philosophy results in the majority of the Groups schemes being of the defined contribution type.
This has always been the case in, for example, the US.
In a limited number of countries of operation the Groups local pension arrangements are entirely or partly of the defined benefit type.
With the exception of the schemes in the UK, Germany and Japan, these defined benefit arrangements are not significant in size, as confirmed by the following summary of the Groups total pension provisions.
The schemes in these three countries are material in size and so full detail on each of them is given in the following narrative.

Benefits provided by the UK Fund are based on final pensionable pay and include a pension which is guaranteed to increase each year by the lower of 5% and the increase in the cost of living.
The UK Fund was closed to new entrants on 1 November 2005, on which date a defined contribution plan was started for the benefit of eligible new joiners to the Groups UK businesses.
There were no significant changes to the UK fund during the year.
The number of active members of the UK Fund was 688 at 31 March 2007 2006: 868 members.
The Group operates two plans in Japan, the financial detail of which is reported in aggregate later in this Note.
There were no significant changes to these plans during 2007.
There were no significant changes in the German scheme during the year.

The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to an employee retiring in 2037.
Medium cohort assumptions are used in the case of the UK Fund.
As the plans in Japan provide a cash sum at retirement, no post retirement life expectancy assumption is required.
Members contribute to the UK Fund at the rate of 4% 2006: 4% except in the case of those members whose contributions are paid by the employer following the launch of a flexible benefits programme in 2005.
There were no employee contributions to either the German fund or the Japanese fund in either 2006 or 2007.
Employer contributions are made to the UK fund at the rate of 21% 2006: 21% and to the Japanese fund as advised by the insurance company which administers the fund.
Contributions to the plans were 11.6m 2006: 13.3m and are expected to be 9.6m in 2008.

Reconciliation of movement in equity continued i Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve represents the reduction in distributable reserves for the amount paid to redeem preference B shares as part of the share capital reorganisation.
ii Foreign exchange reserve The foreign exchange reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and to record the effect of hedging net investments in foreign operations.
iii Other reserves The balance held in other reserves is the share options reserve containing shares in the Employee Benefit Trust and the fair value of options granted under share-based payment schemes.
For details regarding the Groups share-based payment charge, see Note 28.
It also contains a special reserve which reflects the share premium account reduction of July 1988 and unrealised profits on disposals of investments.
The EMI Group General Employee Benefit Trust EBT was established to hedge the future obligations of the Group in respect of shares awarded under the Senior Executive Incentive Plans.
The Trustee of the EBT, EMI Group EBT Guernsey Limited, purchases the Companys Ordinary shares in the market with financing provided by the Company, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group.
The EBT has since December 1998 waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of all of its holding of the Companys Ordinary shares.
The EBTs waiver may be revoked or varied at any time.
EBT 2007 2006 Shares held Shares held In trust Cost in trust Cost No.
The market value at 31 March 2007 of the Ordinary shares held in the EBT, which are listed in the UK, was 5.1m 2006: 8.6m.
All shares held in the EBT are either under option to employees or conditionally gifted to them.
Share-based payment Equity-settled share option schemes Subscription options Options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS are normally exercisable no earlier than three years and no later than ten years following the date of grant, and are subject to the achievement of performance requirements that must be met before the options normally become exercisable.
Options granted under the 2003 Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP, if subject to a pre-vesting performance requirement, are normally exercisable between three and ten years following the date of grant but only if, and to the extent that, the pre-vesting target has been satisfied.
Options granted with pre-grant conditions normally become exercisable in no fewer than four annual tranches commencing no earlier than the second anniversary of the grant date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives for the schemes.
Transfer options Transfer options have been granted to senior executives under the ESOS and the ESIP with the exercise price of the options being the average of the market price of the Companys Ordinary shares in a period of three or five days prior to the date of grant.
The proportion of each option that vests will be determined by the Groups average compound underlying diluted earnings per share growth over RPI from the base year to the end year of the performance period.
The option will lapse if this target increase is not achieved within the three years from the date of grant.
A detailed description of the performance conditions attached to the options is provided in the Remuneration report.
Employee Plan Options granted under the 1994 and 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS are normally exercisable for a six-month period following completion of savings to either a three year or a five year savings contract.
There are no performance criteria attached to these awards.

The measure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share.
For each grant the assumed volatility has been calculated over a period prior to grant commensurate with the expected life of the award.
Adjustments have been made for historic events that are unlikely to recur in the future.
Capital commitments There are no capital commitments at the year end 2006: nil.
Commitments under operating leases at 31 March were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Operating leases: In the first year 25.7 27.6 In the second to fifth years inclusive 77.3 77.9 After the fifth year 106.2 108.8 Total 209.2 214.3 30.
Contingent liabilities Save as described below, there are no legal or arbitration proceedings involving members of the EMI Group which, so far as the Company is aware, may have a material effect on the financial position of the Group: i The Group has along with other companies in the music industry, received requests from the New York State Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice for information regarding conditions and pricing of the online sale of music.
The Group is co-operating fully with these enquiries.
Arising out of these enquiries, certain Group companies have been named, along with other companies in the music industry, in a number of separate lawsuits filed in various courts throughout the United States which have been consolidated for pre-trial purposes.
The cases are styled as class action suits on behalf of consumers, and the plaintiffs assert various federal and state law claims relating to allegations of unfair pricing and anti-competitive practices in connection with the online sale of music.
On the basis of information presently available, EMI is not aware of any reason for believing that there will be a material financial impact on the Group: ii In March 2007, the European Commission EC sent a Statement of Objections SO to major record companies, including EMI Music, and Apple Inc. in relation to agreements between each music company and Apple regarding the iTunes service.
The EC alleges in the SO that these agreements violate European Union rules prohibiting restrictive business practices, in that consumers can only buy music from the iTunes online store in their country of residence.
It is alleged that this market segmentation results from the contractual provisions imposed on Apple by the record companies.
Whilst the process is at an early stage, EMI believes that it is not in breach of European law, and has legal advice to that effect.
It therefore has no reason to believe that there will be any material financial impact on the Group: and iii Pursuant to a joint venture agreement with Mr Norman Cheng Project Typhoon the Group has agreed to establish and fund new businesses in the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong and South Korea.
The Group has an option to buy and Mr Cheng has an option to sell his equity interest in the joint venture in 2009 at a price determined by reference to earnings over a three year period.
Such a price can be limited to not more than $100m.
Contingent liabilities continued The Group has provided the following guarantees at 31 March 2007: i Following the demerger of the Thorn rental business in 1996, Group companies remained contingently liable in respect of guarantees given with regard to certain leases on properties occupied or previously occupied by the Thorn business though, as part of the demerger arrangements, Thorn Limited formerly called Thorn plc agreed to indemnify the Group against such liabilities.
One of the Group companies so liable was sold to HMV Group as part of the 1998 sale and the Company agreed to indemnify HMV Group plc against any such liabilities.
The current or former Thorn properties in respect of which the Group remained contingently liable number approximately 59 2006: 47 and the annual rental payments in respect of such properties total approximately 9.6m 2006: 3.6m.
The figures for the 2006 07 financial year are significantly greater as, since the completion of the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2006, increased and more accurate information has become available from the current owners of the former Thorn rental business.
Following the insolvency of Thorn High Street Properties Limited and certain other companies, claims have arisen against the Group in respect of certain of the guaranteed leases.
Such claims have been met by Thorn Limited pursuant to its agreement to indemnify the Group: ii As part of the sale in 1998 to HMV Group plc HMV Group of the companies and assets comprising HMV, the Group entered into an indemnity deed with HMV Group relating, among other things, to guarantees given by the Group in respect of property leases of which approximately 52 2006: 62 remain outstanding.
Under the deed, HMV Group agreed to indemnify the Group against any payments made under those property leases and certain other guarantees and indemnities.
The aggregate annual rental payments under guaranteed leases are approximately 15.8m 2006: 18.6m, although they are subject to adjustment both up and down under certain circumstances.
The guaranteed leases have terms which expire in one to 19 years 2006: nine to 20 years and eight of the leases expire in years beyond 2017.
The indemnity deed remains in force in respect of lease guarantees, and HMV Group has secured those obligations pursuant to a security deed, the Companys rights under which rank second behind banks which provide senior credit facilities to HMV Group: and iii Letters of credit and third party guarantees totalling 4.2m 2006: 7.0m have been incurred by Group companies.
The Group has not adopted amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which will apply for periods commencing on or after 1 April 2006.
Where the Group enters into financial guarantee contracts, the Group consider them to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
The Group does not expect the amendments to have any impact on the financial statements for the period commencing 1 April 2006.
