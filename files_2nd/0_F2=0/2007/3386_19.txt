The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, the growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period for which management have detailed plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGU being measured the weighted average cost of capital WACC.
The growth rates are based on a prudent view of industry growth forecasts adjusted for a premium associated with the high technological nature of the businesses.
A growth assumption of 2.5% 2006: 2.5% has been used.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows after that period based on growth as described above.
Following a detailed review, no impairment losses for continuing operations have been recognised in the year and no prior impairment losses reversed.

No interest is charged on the receivables from the date of invoice to payment.
There is no provision for irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods 2006: nil.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair values.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
19. CREDIT AND PRICE RISK The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Groups price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.
Price risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and where appropriate the agreement of fixed price supply contracts.

DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses financial instruments to manage financial and commercial risk wherever it is appropriate to do so.
The main risks addressed by the financial instruments of the Group are interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups policies in respect of the management of these risks, which remained unchanged throughout the year, were as follows: Interest rate risk: The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings and leasing lines of credit.
The UK borrowings are denominated in sterling, Euro, US dollar and Norwegian Kroner and are subject to floating rates of interest linked to the Bank of Scotland base rate.
In order to protect against the risk of higher interest rates, the Group has entered into amortising interest rate swaps for at least 50% of its UK borrowings.
The overseas borrowings are denominated in local currency and are predominantly subject to fixed rates of interest.
Foreign exchange risk: Foreign exchange risk can be subdivided into two components, transactional risk and translation risk: Transactional risk The Group policy is to hedge significant transactional currency exposures via the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The measurement and control of this risk is closely monitored on a Group-wide basis.
CHEMRING GROUP PLC FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2007 69 Notes to the Group Financial Statements CONTINUED 23.
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CONTINUED Translation risk: The Group translates overseas results and net assets in accordance with the accounting policy in Note 2.
The translation risk on net assets is mitigated by the transfer of currencies between Group companies and the appropriate use of foreign currency borrowings.
Liquidity risk: Details of the maturity profiles of the Groups funding can be found in Note 20.
The profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is as follows: Financial assets 2007 2006 Total Total m m Sterling 12.3 6.6 US dollar 23.5 25.8 Australian dollar 1.5 0.6 Euro 13.4 1.7 Other currencies 0.7 - 51.4 34.7 Offset in the UK 12.7 21.3 Cash and cash equivalents 38.7 13.4 Financial assets held in the UK enjoy a right of interest offset against overdraft balances.

These are used to offset the interest charged on the UK overdraft which bears interest at 1.25% above LIBOR.
Cash at bank and in hand consists primarily of overseas funds which are used as short term intra-group financing as well as an internal exchange rate hedge.
The weighted average interest rate of fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 October 2007 was 5.7% 2006: 5.8% and the weighted average period of funding was five years 2006: five years.
The Group has three amortising interest rate swaps, from floating to fixed rate: one that expires in 2012 at a rate of 4.97% sterling, one that expires in 2011 at a rate of 4.88% US dollars and one that expires in 2011 at a rate of 4.22% Euro.

Deferred tax balances after offset, for balance sheet purposes are analysed as follows: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax liabilities 12.1 9.5 Deferred tax assets 9.1 9.6 3.0 0.1 At the Balance Sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of 16.8 million 2006: 16.0 million potentially available for offset against future profits in certain circumstances.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of this amount because of the unpredictability of future qualifying profit streams.
These losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
