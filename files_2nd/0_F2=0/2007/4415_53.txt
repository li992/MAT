The Demerger Award Plan The Demerger Award Plan DAP was designed to ensure executives interests were aligned with those of shareholders and to reflect the lost opportunity to participate in the 2002 and 2003 Kingfisher Option Awards.
In addition, it encouraged participants to remain within the Group during the three-year period following the demerger.
The awards vested in three equal instalments and the rights to exercise under the final award had expired by 31 January 2007.
One half of the award was subject to Total Shareholder Return TSR performance criteria against a comparator group of the FTSE 250.
TSR is a measure of performance based on share price and dividends.
The remaining 50 per cent was not subject to performance criteria.
Awards granted to executives under the terms of the DAP were as follows: Kesa shares 2007 2006 Number Number Outstanding at 1 February 2006 2005 1,792,683 3,557,894 Granted during year Forfeited during year 952,121 904,599 Exercised during year 840,562 860,612 Expired during year Outstanding at 31 January 2007 2006 1,792,683 The fair value of awards granted was estimated using the following assumptions: Grant date 28 July 2003 Share price at grant date 2.075 Exercise price nil Number of employees 142 Number of shares in scheme 5,634,973 Vesting period 3 years Option life 3.5 years Expected life 3 years The awards within the DAP were nil cost options or free shares.

Awards provided a cash element representing a deferred bonus and a matching award in respect of a combination of Kingfisher shares and Kesa shares having a value equal to the shares awarded under the relevant Kingfisher incentive plan allowing for the effect of the demerger and the Kingfisher share consolidation.
The value of the awards was based on the respective closing share prices of Kingfisher and Kesa shares following the announcement of their full-year results for the years ending 31 January 2004, 2005 and 2006.
Participants received their share and cash entitlement on 1 April 2004, 2005 and 2006 respectively.
For the year ended 31 January 2006, the awards were based on the closing price of Kingfisher shares on 21 March 2006, which was 248 pence per share and the Kesa share price on 21 March 2006, which was 319.25 pence per share.
The awards granted to executives under the terms of this plan were as follows: Kesa shares Kingfisher shares 2007 2006 2007 2006 Number Number Number Number Outstanding at 1 February 2006 2005 25,024 61,025 109,480 273,515 Granted during year Forfeited during year Exercised during year 25,024 36,001 109,480 164,035 Expired during year Outstanding at 31 January 2007 2006 25,024 109,480 The assumptions applied were as follows: Kesa shares Kingfisher shares Award date 1 April 2003 1 April 2003 Exercise price 0.00 0.00 Number of employees 55 Number of shares in scheme 00 Vesting date 1 April 2006 1 April 2006 Vesting period 2002 scheme Expected life 2002 scheme Vesting period 2003 scheme 3 years 3 years Expected life 2003 scheme 3 years 3 years The shares within the Kesa Group Incentive Compensation Plan were nil cost options or free shares.

90 Kesa Electricals plc Annual report 2006 07 35 Share-based payments continued Deferred Annual Bonus and Performance Share Plan a May 2005 grant of nil cost options The original terms of the Deferred Annual Bonus DAB and Performance Share Plan PSP were approved at the Annual General Meeting in May 2004 and the first nil cost options were granted in May 2005.
DAB Following determination of the bonus for 20042005, the Group initially calculated the number of investment shares that participants would receive by dividing half of the bonus post a notional tax rate for French employees, half of bonus before tax was used by the share price on 23 March 2005 2.99.
Participants were then granted a maximum matching award of shares on a ratio of 1:1 based on the gross value of the investment shares received.
According to the original criteria, the number of matching shares that vested would depend on Kesas TSR performance against a comparator group drawn from companies in the FTSE 250 and measured over a four-year period from grant date.
PSP The PSP consisted of a base award equal to 30 per cent of basic salary, with up to a further 20 per cent potentially available depending on individual personal performance.
Under the terms of the May 2005 grant, awards of rights to shares equivalent to between 30 per cent and 50 per cent of the eligible executives basic salary were made, based on individual performance.
The awards are subject to the same TSR performance conditions as those applying to the DAB shares as explained above.
The fair values of awards within the DAB and PSP were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value of awards granted and the assumptions used were as follows: Grant date 22 May 2005 Share price at grant date 2.70 Exercise price nil Number of employees 21 Number of shares in scheme 500,307 Vesting period 4 years Expected volatility 22% Option life N A Expected life 4 years Risk-free rate 4.34% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 4% Fair value of awards 1.31 The expected volatility was based on historical volatility since 7 July 2003, when Kesa demerged and listed.
The expected life was the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return was the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
