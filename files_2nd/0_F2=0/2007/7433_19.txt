They are considered to have an indefinite life as they can be renewed at minimal costs and therefore no amortisation has been charged.
Non-amortisation is supported by an annual impairment review.
Goodwill of 71.0m arising on the purchase of Ottakars plc on 3 July 2006 see Note 20 has been capitalised.
The carrying value of the goodwill is subject to an annual impairment review so as to ensure that the carrying amount is not greater than the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined from a value in use calculation with regard to the portfolio of stores acquired.
The value in use incorporates cash flow projections based on budgets approved by senior management over a five year period.
The calculation of value in use is sensitive to assumptions made with respect to sales forecasts, gross margin and discount rates.
Cash flows beyond the five years have been extrapolated using a 1% growth rate.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant market.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 10%.
On the basis of the impairment review undertaken, no impairment of the capitalised goodwill was required.
The Company had no intangible assets.

Acquisition of subsidiary On 3 July 2006 the Group acquired for cash the share capital of Ottakars plc.
Ottakars was a chain of book stores which operated from 141 stores in the UK at the date of acquisition.
The book value and fair value of the net assets acquired were as follows: Book value Fair value mm Property, plant and equipment 30.4 21.5 Inventories 27.6 24.0 Receivables 8.0 7.8 Payables 21.8 24.9 Taxation 0.6 2.6 Net debt 31.8 31.8 11.8 0.8 Goodwill arising on acquisition 71.0 Consideration satisfied by cash 70.2 Of the 70.2m consideration, 11.8m was paid in the 52 weeks ended 29 April 2006 when the Group acquired for cash approximately 10% of the share capital for 440p per share.
The remaining 90% of share capital was purchased at 285p per share.
As a result of the acquisition goodwill of 71.0m has been capitalised see Note 15.
From the date of acquisition to 28 April 2007, Ottakars has contributed 138.8m of revenue and made a profit before tax and exceptional items of 6.0m.
In addition, exceptional costs of 10.2m relating to the integration and 2.9m relating to store closures have been charged in the period see Note 7.
If the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period, revenue for the Group would have been 1,916.0m and profit before exceptional items would have been 44.7m.
The fair value of tax assets acquired includes deferred tax arising in the period from the last balance sheet date to the date of acquisition of 1.9m and deferred tax arising on other fair value adjustments of 1.3m.
Included in the 71.0m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.

Committed borrowing facilities Facility Agreement The Company has a Senior Bank Facility, consisting of a multi-currency 260m revolving credit facility and an 80m term debt facility.
The term debt was fully drawn down during the period and has a final maturity date of 31 January 2008, although 20m was prepaid and cancelled on 11 May 2007.

Interest on the facility was payable at a rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.5%.
This increases to 0.55%, inclusive of a 0.05% utilisation fee, if more than two-thirds of the 260m revolving credit facility is drawn and on the drawdown of the 80m term loan.
Following amendments to the Senior Bank Facility, the margin payable increased to 0.875% plus a 0.05% utilisation fee from 30 March 2007 until 27 June 2007, from when the margin will be 1.75%, with the utilisation fee no longer applicable.
Of the 260m revolving credit facility, 97.0m 2006: 60.0m had been drawn down at 28 April 2007.

In addition to direct drawings under the revolving credit facility in the UK, the Group utilises the facility by drawing letters of credit to support facilities provided by local banks overseas.
Although these locally provided facilities nominally expire in less than one year, they could be renewed provided that the letter of credit drawn under the revolving credit facility is renewed.
The table above reflects the undrawn portion of these locally provided facilities as expiring in less than one year.
As at 28 April 2007, letters of credit issued totalled 4.5m 2006: 4.9m of which 4.5m was undrawn 2006: 4.9m.
Also, the Company has given a parent guarantee to support uncommitted local facilities totalling 6.3m 2006: 14.5m, of which 6.3m was undrawn at 28 April 2007 2006: 14.5m.
Security The borrowings under the Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and earnings before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 70% of the total gross assets, revenue and earnings before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited and HMV UK Limited.
Following amendments to the facility since the year end, HMV Ireland Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Ireland Limited and HMV Guernsey Limited will also become guarantors.
The Company has granted security comprising first-ranking, fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.

The utilisation of provisions in the current year largely reflects store closures and the rental costs, net of sublet income, of previously closed stores.
The 6.9m provision created in the year was in respect of restructuring costs in HMV UK and costs of integrating the Ottakars acquisition including related store closures.
The remaining provisions are expected to be utilised in the next two years.

Treasury policies recommend covering up to six months in advance on forecast exposures using derivative products comprising of forward foreign currency contracts and currency options, although the Group has not used currency options during the year.
In all cases the implementation of these derivative instruments has been negotiated to match expected purchases and they therefore qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of cash flow hedges in place at 28 April 2007 is nil 2006: nil.
Other hedging activity Based on its current debt levels, the Group moves to a net cash position during its third quarter and therefore interest rate exposure is limited.
Consequently, no interest rate hedges have been implemented.
Interest rate exposures continue to be monitored in accordance with the Groups treasury policies.

However, as the minimum performance conditions have not been met, these options will lapse in the 2007 08 financial year.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes model.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows: Group and Company 2007 2006 Dividend yield % 5.0 2.5 Expected volatility % 25.0 25.0 Expected life years 5.4 5.4 Risk-free interest rate % 4.5 4.5 Weighted average share price p 154 242 Weighted average exercise price p 154 242 Weighted average fair value p 26 57 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Equity-settled deferred annual bonus As part of the HMV Group plc Incentive Plan for Senior Executives HIPS, as discussed more fully in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 31 and 32, the Company makes deferred awards to certain Directors and senior management.
These awards are made in shares and the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the market value of shares at the time the award is made, not when it is paid.
No adjustment to value is made for expected dividend income during the vesting period.
The deferred award normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in which the award is made, subject to the achievement of certain profit related targets and the performance of the individual over the vesting period.
The charge in respect of deferred awards during the period ended 28 April 2007 was 0.1m 2006: credit of 0.9m.
A credit arose in the prior period as performance conditions for deferred awards vesting were not met and management revised their estimate of the achievability of performance conditions relating to deferred awards vesting in future periods.

Equity-settled Performance Share Plan PSP The HMV Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced during the year, as discussed more fully in the Remuneration Report on page 31.
Under the PSP the Executive Directors and certain employees are granted an award of shares, which vest after three years provided that preset performance criteria, set by the Remuneration Committee, are met.
The number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the market value of shares, adjusted for expected dividend income during the vesting period.

Under the SIP, employees may acquire Ordinary Shares in three ways.
Firstly, the Company can use the SIP as part of its broad incentive arrangements by awarding free shares to employees: in this regard an award of 120 free shares was made to every eligible employee on the Initial Public Offering in May 2002.
There have not been any further awards of free shares and there are no plans to award further free shares to any employees.
Secondly, the Company may invite UK employees to purchase Ordinary Shares, known as partnership shares, and thirdly, the Company may, if it wishes, agree to match the shares purchased with additional shares, known as matching shares.
The Company has matched on a one for one basis since the inception of the SIP.
The charge in respect of the SIP during the year ended 28 April 2007 was 0.6m 2006: 0.6m.

Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
There is also a small defined benefit pension arrangement in Ireland, which is included in the Group amounts disclosed below.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
The benefits it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members contribute at the rate of 5% of pensionable pay.
A qualified actuary made an actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2004.
The valuation was based on an assumed investment return of 6.5% a year, salary increases of 4.25% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.75%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 79%, representing a funding deficit of 11.5m.
The market value of the assets of the Pension Benefit Scheme at 30 June 2004 was about 43.9m.
In order to eliminate the past service deficit, the Group decided to make three special contributions of 4.4m each on 31 March 2005, 31 May 2005 and 31 May 2006.
In addition, the funding rate was set at 19.9% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses.
Therefore from 1 July 2005, the Group has been contributing at a rate of 14.9% of pensionable pay, with the members contributing at 5% of pensionable pay.
The Pension Benefit Section was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002, with the exception of 543 members who transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 from the EMI Group Pension Fund as a result of the Groups flotation on the London Stock Exchange.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2007.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section for the year ended 28 April 2007 were 7.2m 2006: 7.7m, inclusive of a 4.4m special contribution in each year.
The total employer contributions to the defined benefit plans for the financial year commencing on 29 April 2007 are expected to be 2.8m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Saver Section for the year ended 28 April 2007 were 0.8m 2006: 0.8m.
In addition, employer contributions to similar pension arrangements in HMVs international businesses totalled 0.4m 2006: 0.8m Defined benefit pensions Amounts reflected in the financial statements in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme are determined with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit funding method.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the respective balance sheet dates.
The major assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: As at As at 28 April 2007 29 April 2006 % per annum % per annum Rate of price inflation 3.10 2.85 Rate of salary increase 4.60 4.35 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.10 2.85 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.40 5.10 Expected rate of return on equities 7.80 7.80 Expected rate of return on bonds 5.40 5.10 Expected rate of return on index-linked bonds 4.80 4.40 79 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the financial statements continued 33.
Pension arrangements continued The expected rate of return on Scheme assets is based on consistent assumptions with the previous year, adjusted to reflect changes in market conditions since that date.
The main non-financial assumptions are consistent with those used for the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 June 2004.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions adopted in 2004 were the standard PM FA92 series with allowance for future improvements in mortality, which imply the following life expectancies for someone age 60: At age 60 for At age 60 for someone someone currently currently Life expectancy years aged 60 aged 40 Male 23.9 25.9 Female 27.2 29.0 Group On the basis of the above assumptions, the amounts charged or credited to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for the period ended 28 April 2007 are set out below: 2007 2006 m m Recognised in the income statement Current service cost 4.7 4.7 Past service cost Total recognised in arriving at operating profit 4.7 4.7 Finance charge Interest on pension scheme liabilities 5.2 4.4 Expected rate of return on assets in the pension scheme 5.4 4.2 Net credit charge to other finance income expense 0.2 0.2 Total income statement charge before deduction for taxation 4.5 4.9 Taken to the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on scheme assets 4.1 12.9 Less: expected return on scheme assets 5.4 4.2 1.3 8.7 Other actuarial gains and losses 1.3 6.5 Actuarial gain recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 2.2 80 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 33.

Pension arrangements continued The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 25 April 2004 in the Group statement of recognised income and expense is 12.9 m 2006: 12.9 m. The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 17.4m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity in the Group, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of recognised income and expense before 25 April 2004.
Company The Company, as sponsoring employer of the UK defined benefit scheme, recognises the net pension obligation for the Scheme.
The other participating members of the scheme account for their relevant pension costs on a defined contribution basis.
The movement during the period in the defined benefit pension Scheme deficit recognised on the Company balance sheet is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Deficit in scheme at the beginning of the period 24.8 29.1 Contributions paid 7.2 5.0 Current service cost 4.6 2.1 Net credit charge to other finance income expense 0.2 0.2 Actuarial gain 1.6 Deficit in scheme at the end of the period 22.0 24.8 Deferred tax 6.6 7.4 Net pension liability 15.4 17.4 The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses recognised since 25 April 2004 in the Company statement of recognised income and expense is 13.1 m 2006: 13.1 m. The Directors are unable to determine how much of the Scheme deficit of 16.9m, recognised on transition to IFRS and taken directly to equity in the Company, is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the Scheme.
Consequently, the Directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Company statement of recognised income and expenses before 25 April 2004.
