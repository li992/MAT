Share-based payments continued valuation The estimated value of warrants issued by FS Invest is measured by the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions and exercise restrictions.
Assumptions at time of grant, July 2006 Series A Series B Share price DKK 1,019 1,019 Exercise price 2,039 2,549 volatility 20% 20% Risk free interest rate 8 year swap rate 3.60% 3.60% Dividend per share DKK 0 0 Time to maturity years 8 8 Number of FS Invest shares outstanding 7,686,537 7,686,537 Number of FS Invest warrants outstanding 2,202,812 2,202,812 Exercise restrictions The warrants are subject to exercise restrictions depending on the share price at the time of exercise the Exercise Share Price : If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 6,114, 100% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 4,076 and below DKK 6,114, 90% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 3,312 and below DKK 4,076, 85% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 3,057 and below DKK 3,312, 80% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 2,803 and below DKK 3,057, 75% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 2,547 and below DKK 2,803, 65% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 2,293 and below DKK 2,547, 45% of the granted warrants can be exercised: If the Exercise Share Price is equal to or above DKK 2,038 and below DKK 2,293, 10% of the granted warrants can be exercised.
FS Invest and ISS are privately held companies and therefore it is not possible to apply market data to measure the volatility of the underlying share.
A volatility of 20% has been applied in the Black-Scholes valuation.
This is on level with the volatility, which can be measured for the period January 2004 to the fide-listing of the ISS A S share in June 2005 using weekly observations of market data.
The risk free interest rate applied in the Black-Scholes model is the Euro swap rate with a duration matching the time to maturity of the warrants.
At the time of the grant, an eight year swap rate of 3.6% was used to estimate the Black-Scholes value.
Applying these assumptions, the Group estimates that the value of the warrants granted under the FS Invest warrant programme was DKK 25 million at the time of the grant in July 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 2, these warrants will be expensed in the income statement over the vesting period from July 2006 to June 2014.
