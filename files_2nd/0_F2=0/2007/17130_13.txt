The address of the registered office is Greenside House, 50 Station Road, London, N22 7TP.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 4 to 11.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year the Group has not been subject to any new mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
Four Interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives: and IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The adoption of these Interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these Group financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures: IFRS 8 Operating segments: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions: IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements: IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes: and IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction.
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when IFRS 7 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Basis of accounting The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The Group financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 1 January 2008.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combination On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Investment in associates and joint ventures An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
43 Investment in associates and joint ventures continued The results and assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in these Group financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associates and joint ventures in excess of the Groups interest in those entities are not recognised.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the entity at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the entity at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in profit and loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group Company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant entity.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable from customers and represents amounts receivable for goods and services that the Group is in business to provide net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, as set out below.
In the case of the LBO, telephone, interactive sportsbook businesses and online casino operations including games on the online arcade and other numbers bets, revenue represents gains and losses from betting activity in the period.
Open positions are carried at fair market value and gains and losses arising on this valuation are recognised in revenue, as well as gains and losses realised on positions that have closed.
Revenue from the online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by the period end.
Amounts wagered represents the gross takings receivable from customers in respect of individual bets placed in the period on events for LBO, telephone and interactive sports businesses, net winnings on gaming activity completed by period end for online casinos and net income earned from poker games completed by period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, revenue represents income arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including sales of refreshments and tote income.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
44 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Statement of Group Accounting Policies Statement of Group Accounting Policies William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group makes every effort to match its foreign currency assets and liabilities.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Finance costs Finance costs of borrowings are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of those borrowings at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Government grants Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to profit and loss over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging exceptional operating items and after the share of results of associates and joint ventures but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are included in finance costs and investment income as appropriate.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
45 Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at their cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
Fixtures and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties over the unexpired period of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles at variable rates between 3 and 10 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets.
Internally generated intangible assets computer software and systems Expenditure on initial investigation and design of computer software and systems is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development of computer systems is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, generally between three and ten years.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets licences Betting licences are recorded at cost or if arising in an acquisition at their fair value.
They are judged to have an indefinite life and are accordingly not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
The directors consider that the Groups licences have an indefinite life due to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well established market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing its betting permits and licences.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, which are based on the budgeted figures for the following year and subsequently an annual growth rate of 2.4%, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of 46 money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Statement of Group Accounting Policies Statement of Group Accounting Policies William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Impairment of tangible and intangible assets continued If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories represent stocks of consumables in stores and goods for resale within the greyhound stadia.
They are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment from 31 December 2003.
In accordance with the transition provisions included in IFRS 2, its provisions have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and operates an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme open to all eligible employees which allows the purchase of shares at a discount.
The cost to the Group of share-based payment plans is measured at fair value at the date of grant.
Fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing formula.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimates, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Where relevant, the value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account any market conditions applicable to the option.
Further descriptions of the Groups share-based payment plans are given in note 34.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term bank deposits held by the Group with an original maturity of three months or less.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liability and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the profit and loss account using the effective interest method.
Any accrued finance costs are included in accruals and deferred income within trade and other payables.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
47 Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap and collar contracts to hedge its interest rate exposure and retains cash balances in foreign currencies matched against its foreign currency liabilities client deposit accounts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Bets are carried at fair market value as they meet the definition of a derivative.
The resulting gains and losses from bets are included in revenue.
Assets or liabilities resulting from open positions are reported gross in financial assets and financial liabilities under the term Derivative financial instruments.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in this Statement of Group Accounting Policies, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The estimates and assumptions, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill or those intangible assets has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Note 12 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements.
Fair value of derivatives As described in note 22 the Group uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The directors use their judgement in selecting appropriate valuation techniques for these financial derivatives.
Assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument.
Retirement Benefit costs The determination of the pension cost and defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes depends on the selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, inflation rate, salary growth, mortality and expected return on scheme assets.
Differences arising from actual experiences or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in subsequent periods.
Note 35 provides information on the assumptions used in these financial statements.

The use of a ten-year life in respect of some of the software is supported by warranties written into the relevant software supply contract.
Licences are judged to have an indefinite life and are accordingly not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
As stated in the Statement of Group Accounting Policies, the Group performs an annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amount.
Testing is carried out by allocating the carrying value of these assets to groups of cash generating units CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined by value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts using the future periods budget, which are then extrapolated by a growth rate.
The discount rate applied to the future cash flows of a CGU is 10.8% 2006: 10.7% and cash flows beyond the budget period are extrapolated using a 2.4% growth rate 2006: 2.4%.

William Hill Organization Limiteds shareholding has decreased in the period from 20.95% to 19.5% due to the sale of shares to a third party.
The investment has still been accounted for as an associated undertaking using the equity method as following the disposal, the Group is still able to exert significant influence over SIS, by way of its 19.5% holding and seat on the Board of directors.
The change in the Groups share of its net assets is shown above.
The SIS group of companies provides real time pre-event information and results, as well as live coverage of horse racing, greyhound racing and certain numbers draws, via satellite.
The statutory financial statements of SIS are prepared to the year ending 31 March.
The consolidated figures above are based on management accounts for the calendar year 2007.
Goodwill relating to the acquisition of shares in SIS of 24m was fully provided against in 1999 to recognise an impairment in the carrying value.
The following financial information relates to SIS: 1 January 2008 26 December 2006 m m Total assets 67.7 58.5 Total liabilities 33.9 32.8 Total revenue 146.8 144.9 Total profit after tax 16.6 16.3 William Hill Organization Limited also holds directly or indirectly 33% of the entire share capital of Lucky Choice Limited and of 49s Limited.
These companies were formed for the purpose of promoting and publicising certain numbers betting formats.
In the opinion of the directors, the results of these companies are not material to the results of the Group.
Consequently, the investments have been stated at cost and have not been accounted for under the equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

The first facility is for a total commitment of 1,200m, and is split into two tranches: Tranche A comprising a term loan of 600m repayable on 1 March 2010: and Tranche B comprising a revolving facility of 600m available until 1 March 2010.
The second facility agreement is for a term loan of 250m, which is repayable on 30 July 2011.
Mandatory repayments are required to be made under the terms of both sets of loan documentation, including, but not limited to, the net proceeds of certain asset sales.
The maturity profile above is analysed on the basis of calendar years from the balance sheet date.
The borrowings drawn down under the 1,200m facility agreement bear interest at a variable margin of between 0.4% and 0.75% above LIBOR, dependent on certain financial ratios.
The applicable margin at 1 January 2008 was 0.525%.
A commitment fee of 37.5% of the applicable margin is payable on the undrawn element of the revolving facility.
The revolving facility drawn down at 1 January 2008 was 305m 26 December 2006 - 295m.
The 250m borrowings under the second facility agreement bear interest at a fixed margin of 0.90% above LIBOR.
The facility agreements are secured by guarantees given by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.

Bank overdrafts and loans continued Overdraft facility At 1 January 2008, the Group had an overdraft facility with National Westminster Bank plc of 5.0m 26 December 2006 - 5.0m.
The balance on this facility at 1 January 2008 was nil 26 December 2006 nil.
Fair value of loans and facilities It is the directors opinion that due to the Groups borrowings being subject to floating interest rates and the proven cash generation capability of the Group, there is no significant difference between book and fair value of the Groups bank facilities and other borrowings.

Interest rate hedging arrangements The Group uses interest rate swaps and collars to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swap arrangements as at 1 January 2008 under which the LIBOR element of the interest payable is swapped for fixed rate payments.
The notional principal hedged under these swaps varies between 455m and 100m over the period to 31 December 2012.
At 1 January 2008 the notional principal hedged under these arrangements was 455m.
The fixed interest rate under the swaps varies from 4.4% to 5.34%.
In addition the Group has also entered into interest rate collars arrangements expiring between 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2012 under which the floating LIBOR rate is capped at rates between 4.75% and 5.5% with floors of between 3.75% and 4.50%.
The notional principal amount hedged under these arrangements varies between 460m and 100m over the period to 31 December 2012.
At 1 January 2008 the notional principal amount under the Groups interest rate collars was 460m.
The fair value of swaps and collars entered into at 1 January 2008 is estimated as an asset of 5.2m 26 December 2006 asset 14.4m.
Derivative pricing models have been used to calculate these fair values.
All of these interest rate swaps are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
An amount of 7.6m 52 weeks ended 26 December 2006 0.7m has been received in respect of hedged interest payments received made in the period.

Share-based payments The Group had the following share-based payment schemes in operation during the period, all of which will be settled by equity: a Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Executive Bonus Matching Scheme EBMS encompassing awards made in the five years from 2003 to 2007: b Save As You Earn share option scheme involving options granted after 7 November 2002 SAYE encompassing grants made in the five years from 2003 to 2007: c Executive Director Incentive Plan EDIP : and d Save As You Earn share option schemes involving options granted before 7 November 2002 2002 SAYE encompassing a grant made in 2002.
Details of these schemes are provided on pages 17 and 18 in the Directors Remuneration Report.
In accordance with the transition provisions included in IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
In the context of the Groups schemes, this includes items a and b above.
The total expense recognised excluding employers National Insurance costs in respect of these schemes was 2.6m in the 53 weeks ended 1 January 2008 52 weeks ended 26 December 2006 3.0m.
a Performance Share Plan PSP, Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and Executive Bonus Matching Scheme EBMS The PSP and EBMS provides conditional awards of shares dependent on the Groups earnings per share growth and Total Shareholder Return TSR performance over a three-year period as well as continued employment of the individual at the date of vesting awards are usually forfeited if the employee leaves the Group voluntarily before the awards vest.
The LTIP provides conditional awards of shares dependent exclusively on the Groups TSR performance over a three-year period and continued employment of the individual at the date of vesting.
In the case of both plans, if the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, the option lapses.

This ensures that the volatility calculation is not unduly affected by erratic price movements that arose immediately after flotation.
The expected life of the option used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The value of the option has also been adjusted to take into account the market conditions applicable to the option i. e. TSR requirements by applying a discount to the option value.
This discount is calculated based on an estimate of the probability of achieving the relevant condition.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted under the PSP, LTIP and EBMS schemes at the date of grant was 2.42 per option 26 December 2006 2.29.

Defined benefit scheme The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme for eligible employees which closed to new members in 2002.
Under the scheme, employees are entitled to retirement benefits varying between 1.67% and 3.33% of final pensionable pay for each year of service on attainment of a retirement age of 63.
The scheme is a funded scheme and the rate of company contributions paid during 2007 was 19.2% of members pensionable pay.
In addition, during 2007 the Group made an additional contribution of 9.4m as the third annual payment of a five-year funding plan agreed with the Trustee to remove the funding deficit disclosed at the last formal actuarial valuation at 30 September 2004.
This funding plan is currently under review as part of the formal actuarial valuation, which has an effective date of 30 September 2007.
This valuation is the first under new UK funding regulations and following discussions between the Trustees and the Company, will set the schemes statutory funding objective.
The general principles adopted by the Trustees for the purposes of this funding valuation are that the assumptions used, taken as a whole, will be sufficiently prudent for pensions already in payment to continue to be paid, and to reflect the commitments which will arise from members accrued pensions right.
For the purposes of preparing the information disclosed in these accounts, a full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 30 September 2007 and updated to 1 January 2008 by a qualified independent actuary.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Disclosure of principal assumptions The financial assumptions used by the actuary in determining the present value of the defined benefit schemes liabilities were: 1 January 26 December 2008 2006 Rate of increase of salaries 4.25% 4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.25% 3.00% Discount rate 5.60% 5.10% Inflation rate 3.25% 3.00% In accordance with the accounting standard, the discount rate has been determined by reference to market yields at the balance sheet date on high quality fixed income investments at a term consistent with the expected duration of the liabilities.
Price inflation is determined by the difference between the yields on fixed and index-linked government bonds with an adjustment to allow for differences in the demand for those bonds, which can distort this figure.
The Bank of England target inflation rate has also been considered in setting this assumption.
The expected rate of salary growth and pension increases are set with reference to the expected rate of inflation.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Following recent studies, which show a faster rate of mortality improvement than had previously been expected, the mortality assumption has been updated.
The current life expectancies for a male member underlying the value of the accrued liabilities are: 1 January 26 December Life Expectancy at age 63 2008 2006 Member currently aged 63 22 years 19 years Member currently aged 45 23 years 22 years The assets in the scheme and their expected rate of return are set out in the table below.
The expected rate of return is determined by taking the long term rates of return available on government and corporate bonds at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on equities is calculated by applying a suitable risk premium to the return on government bonds having regard to historic returns and long-term future expectations.

Retirement benefit schemes continued Movements in the present value of defined benefit obligations in the current period were as follows: 1 January 26 December 2008 2006 m m At beginning of period 231.8 221.2 Movement in period: Service cost 6.1 6.1 Interest cost 11.7 10.7 Contributions from scheme members 1.2 1.2 Actuarial gains 13.0 3.0 Benefits paid 5.5 5.1 Past service cost 0.2 0.7 At end of period 232.5 231.8 Movements in the present value of fair value of scheme assets in the current period were as follows: 1 January 26 December 2008 2006 m m At beginning of period 206.7 171.9 Movement in period: Expected return on scheme assets 12.7 10.1 Actuarial losses gains 0.1 13.7 Contributions from the sponsoring companies 14.3 14.9 Contributions from scheme members 1.2 1.2 Benefits paid 5.5 5.1 At end of period 229.3 206.7 History of experience gains and losses: 53 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 1 January 26 December 27 December 2008 2006 2005 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 0.1 13.7 18.8 % of scheme assets 0% 7% 11% Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 4.9 4.8 2.1 % of the present value of the scheme liabilities 2% 2% 1% Impact of changes in assumptions The sensitivity of the present value of the schemes liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated in the table that follows.
The illustrations consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged.
In practice, changes in one assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption although this is not always the case.
In addition, changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the market value of the scheme assets, which may or may not offset the change in assumptions.

Decrease by 5m 2% Rate of increase in inflation Increase by 0.1% p. a.
Increase by 4m 2% Life expectancy Members assumed to live 1 year longer Increase by 6m 3% If the change in assumptions is in the opposite direction to that shown above, the impact on the defined benefits liabilities would be of a similar magnitude, again in the opposite direction.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from financial instruments held by the defined benefit scheme Pension assets and liabilities pre-tax of 229.3m and 232.5m respectively are held on the Groups balance sheet as at 1 January 2008.
Movements in equity markets, long term interest rates, inflation and life expectancy could materially affect these amounts and could give rise to a requirement for additional contributions, or a reduction in contributions from the Group.
The schemes investment strategy is set by the Trustees following consultation with the Group.
The defined benefit scheme has a significant holding of equity investments which produce more variable returns than bonds and are therefore considered riskier.
It is generally accepted that the yield on equity investments will contain a premium to compensate for this additional risk.
In conjunction with the Trustees, the Group will shortly be carrying out an asset-liability review for the defined benefit scheme to assist the Trustees and the Group to determine the optimal long-term asset allocation based in the structure of liabilities within the scheme.
