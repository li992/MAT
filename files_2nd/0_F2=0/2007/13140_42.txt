11 Adjusted figures Reed Elsevier uses adjusted figures as additional performance measures.
Adjusted figures are stated before amortisation of acquired intangible assets, acquisition integration costs, disposals and other non operating items, related tax effects and movements in deferred taxation assets and liabilities that are not expected to crystallise in the near term.
Adjusted operating profit is also grossed up to exclude the equity share of taxes in joint ventures.
Adjusted operating cash flow is measured after net capital expenditure and dividends from joint ventures but before payments in relation to acquisition integration costs.
Adjusted figures are derived as follows: 2007 2006 Continuing operations m m Operating profit continuing operations 888 837 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 221 211 Acquisition integration costs 20 23 Reclassification of tax in joint ventures 8 10 Adjusted operating profit from continuing operations 1,137 1,081 Profit before tax continuing operations 812 678 Adjustments: Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 221 211 Acquisition integration costs 20 23 Reclassification of tax in joint ventures 8 10 Disposals and other non operating items 63 1 Adjusted profit before tax from continuing operations 998 923 Combined financial statements 114 Notes to the combined financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2007 11 Adjusted figures continued 2007 2006 m m Profit attributable to parent companies' shareholders 1,200 623 Net profit from discontinued operations 309 33 Profit attributable to parent companies shareholders continuing operations 891 590 Adjustments post tax : Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 247 236 Acquisition integration costs 13 16 Disposals and other non operating items 290 64 Deferred tax not expected to crystallise in the near term: Unrealised exchange differences on long term inter affiliate lending 21 22 Acquired intangible assets 60 56 Other 15 6 Adjusted profit attributable to parent companies shareholders from continuing operations 765 706 Cash generated from operations 1,218 1,213 Dividends received from joint ventures 12 16 Purchases of property, plant and equipment 65 68 Proceeds on disposals of property, plant and equipment 4 2 Expenditure on internally developed intangible assets 80 99 Payments in relation to acquisition integration costs 19 22 Adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations 1,108 1,086 2007 2006 Total operations m m Profit attributable to parent companies shareholders total operations 1,200 623 Adjustments post tax : Amortisation of acquired intangible assets 259 324 Acquisition integration costs 13 16 Disposals and other non operating items 521 64 Deferred tax not expected to crystallise in the near term: Unrealised exchange differences on long term inter affiliate lending 21 22 Acquired intangible assets 63 87 Other 15 6 Adjusted profit attributable to parent companies shareholders from total operations 852 796
