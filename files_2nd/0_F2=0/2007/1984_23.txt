Following the impairment test, it was determined that no impairment was required 2006: nil.
The recoverable amount for cash generating units has been measured based on a value in use calculation.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% was used in the value in use calculation.
The allocation of goodwill to cash generating units CGU by geographical segments is as follows: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2007 2006 m m UK and Ireland 74.0 34.5 Nordic 193.1 182.1 Continent 116.6 80.4 Total 383.7 297.0 In testing goodwill for impairment, the recoverable amount of each CGUs goodwill is calculated, based on an estimate of their discounted future cash flows.
Future cash flows are based on board approved budgets and strategic plans for a period of the next three years.
Forecasts for the following years are conservatively extrapolated based on the growth rate and profitability outlined in the approved plans.
The following key assumptions in the value in use calculations were uniformly applied to each cash generating unit: Budgeted revenue and salary growth was based on the groups approved budgets and strategic plans between 2008 and 2010.
Budgeted margin between 2008 and 2010 was based on the average achieved margin in the 12 month period before the budget period uplifted for expected efficiency improvements which management believes are reasonably achievable.
Growth rates reflected within the cash flows after 2011 have been increased in line with historic GDP growth for the appropriate country.

The four swaps entered into for this purpose have been designated as cash flow hedges.
On 19th January 2007, the group swapped a futher notional principal of55 million from floating to fixed rates and the two swaps entered into have been designated as cash flow hedges.
On 23rd January 2008, a notional principal amount of DKK 400 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
This swap will qualify as a cash flow hedge.
On 25th May 2006 the group undertook a private placement in the US for $250 million at fixed rates for periods between 812 years and the amount was immediately converted into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
The conversion into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros was achieved in two stages.
In the first stage six swaps were taken out to convert US dollars to sterling.
Five of these hedges have been designated as cash flow hedges and one as a fair value hedge.
In the second stage six further swaps were taken out to convert sterling to the required currencies.
These have been designated as hedges of net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
The fixed interest rate cross currency contracts entered into have options exercisable by either party to terminate after five years and ten years if relevant.
The value of the swap at the time would then be cash settled.
These swaps all have a maturity of greater than 12 monthswith no contractual re-pricing.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance 74 Financial statements Investors Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17 Derivative financial instruments continued Cash flow hedges The swaps of205 million have resulted in the recognition of a derivative asset of 3.9 million.
At 31st December 2007 the fixed interest rates vary from 3.11% to 4.10%, the floating rate being EURIBOR.
The blended rate for the group on this amount is 3.41%.
Of the $250 million private placement $200 million was swapped into fixed rates via sterling swaps.
The fixed rate on the US private placement which has been swapped varies from 5.56% to 5.66%.
The derivative liability recognised on these five instruments is 7.5 million.
The exchange component of this derivative liability has been accounted for as a component part of currency translation 14.8 million loss.
The remaining 7.3 million profit has been taken to the hedging reserve.
Net investment hedges The second stage of the US private placement swaps results in sterling being exchanged into Danish krone, Swedish krona and euros.
At 31st December the fixed rate borrowings vary between rates of 4.26% and 4.63% on the fixed European swaps.
The floating Danish krone swap varies is on CIBOR.
These swaps are accounted for as hedges of the groups assets in the relevant countries.

The foreign exchange loss of 21.2 million on translation is in reserves as a component part of currency translation.
The swaps used in relation to this hedge have a maturity of between two and five years with no contractual re-pricing.
Fair value hedges $50 million of the US Private placement was swapped into a floating Danish krone 309.1 million, via a sterling swap.
The sterling swap is dealt with as a fair value hedge.
The ineffective proportion of the fair value hedge resulted in a profit of 39,446 2006: 40,725.
The fair value hedge has resulted in the recognition of a 2.8 million derivative liability.
18 Financial risk management 18.1 Financial risk factors The groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk: fair value interest rate risk: cash flow interest rate risk and price risk : credit risk and liquidity risk.
The groups overall risk management programmes focus on the unpredictability of financial markets and seek to minimise potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the group finance team under the supervision of the Finance Director under policies approved by the board of directors.
The Finance Director identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board approves written principles for foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and credit risk, and the use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and receives regular reports on such matters.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The majority of operations in the group bill their revenues and incur their costs in the same functional currency.
The group faces some currency exposure in respect of the procurement of textiles and capital equipment.
While these risks are typically not material, the group is increasingly sourcing textiles direct from suppliers and, where any transactions exposure is significant in the context of the trading company concerned, a forward contract may be entered into by that company: this would be dependent on the certainty of the exposure as to timing and amount and the exchange relevant at the time.
At the year end, the group had two forward contracts for the purchase of US$1.8 million.
Since the year end, a further three contracts were undertaken for the purchase of US$1.6 million, in respect of purchases of textiles from Far East suppliers.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance Financial statements 75 Investors 18.1 Financial risk factors continued The groups policy is not to hedge foreign currency exposures on the translation of its overseas profit to sterling.
Where appropriate, borrowings are effectively arranged in currencies so as to provide a natural hedge against the investment in overseas net assets.
During 2007 and 2006, derivative financial instruments were used to manage foreign currency risk as follows: As at 31st December 2007 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 19.1 20.8 26.9 12.3 3.1 82.2 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 1.1 160.2 126.1 69.3 84.2 438.7 Finance lease liabilities 7.5 0.1 2.7 0.3 10.6 Pre-derivative position 12.7 139.4 126.1 42.5 74.6 2.8 367.1 Derivative effect 46.7 126.1 41.9 49.6 12.1 Net debt position 12.7 186.1 84.4 124.2 2.8 379.2 As at 31st December 2006 Sterling Euro US dollar Danish krone Swedish krona Other Total m m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 90.9 22.1 23.5 11.3 1.9 149.7 Bank overdrafts 0.1 0.1 Borrowings, excluding finance lease liabilities 1.0 101.5 127.7 70.1 75.6 4.6 378.5 Finance lease liabilities 5.7 0.1 0.1 2.2 0.3 8.4 Pre-derivative position 86.3 79.5 127.7 46.7 66.6 3.0 237.2 Derivative effect 46.6 127.7 39.0 51.2 9.1 Net debt position 86.3 126.1 85.7 117.8 3.0 246.3 The exposure to euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone largely relate to our net investment hedge activities as described and shown in note 17. ii Price risk The group is not exposed to any equity securities or commodities price risk.
iii Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest bearing assets include cash and cash equivalents which earn interest at floating rates.
The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain a majority of its borrowings at fixed rate using interest rate swaps to achieve this when necessary.
During 2007 and 2006, the groups borrowings at variable rate were denominated in euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone.
As at 31st December 2007, the group has205 million swaps to convert floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
On 23rd January 2008, DKK 400 million was swapped from floating to fixed rates.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance 76 Financial statements Investors Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.1 Financial risk factors continued The following table sets out the carrying amount, by contractual repricing date or maturity where there is no repricing, of fixed rate borrowings that are exposed to interest rate risk before taking into account interest rate swaps: As at As at 31st December 31st December 2007 2006 m m Fixed interest rate borrowings In one year or less 3.9 2.8 In more than one year, but not more than two years 3.2 2.4 In more than two years but not more than five years 5.6 3.2 In more than five years 126.5 126.7 139.2 135.1 Floating interest rate borrowings 310.1 251.8 Total borrowings 449.3 386.9 During 2007 and 2006, net debt was managed using derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk as follows: As at 31st December 2007 As at 31st December 2006 Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total Fixed-rate Floating-rate Total m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 82.2 82.2 149.7 149.7 Borrowings 139.2 310.1 449.3 135.1 251.8 386.9 Pre-derivative position 139.2 227.9 367.1 135.1 102.1 237.2 Derivative effect 132.6 120.5 12.1 82.3 73.2 9.1 Net debt position 271.8 107.4 379.2 217.4 28.9 246.3 b Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a group or local basis as appropriate.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers spread across geographical areas.
If there is no independent rating, management assesses the credit quality of the customer taking into account, its financial position, past experience and other factors.
Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings.
Management monitors the utilisation of credit limits regularly.
Management does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 14 trade receivables.
Management does not expect any losses from non-performance by the counterparties.
Treasury related credit risk Counterparty risk arises from the investment of surplus funds and from use of derivative instruments.
As at 31st December 2007 and 2006, we had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
In accordance with our treasury policies and exposure management practices, counterparty credit exposure limits are continually monitored and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
Management does not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
The counterparty exposure under all financial assets including trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial contracts were 249.2 million 2006: 275.8 million.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance Financial statements 77 Investors 18.1 Financial risk factors continued c Liquidity risk We manage our liquidity requirements by the use of both shortand long-term cash flow forecasts.
These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom position which is used to demonstrate funding adequacy for periods of 1236 months at least.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK, euro, Swedish krona and Danish krone interest rates and sterling exchange rate on our financial instruments.
We have excluded from this analysis the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of trade receivables and payables, since these are not exposed to risk from the market variables.
This analysis excludes the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying value of pension and other post-retirement obligations, provisions and on the non-financial assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31st December 2007 and 31st December 2006.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the positions at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended, as all of these varied.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: financial derivatives in net investment hedging relationship will not influence interest or foreign exchange sensitivity analysis: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, deposits and derivative instruments: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is recorded fully within the income statement: changes in the carrying value of financial instruments from movements in exchange rates are recorded fully within equity.

The foreign exchange risk is naturally hedged against the net assets of our operations in Continental Europe.
All foreign exchange on both the borrowings and net assets is taken to reserves where it will offset.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or take other steps to increase share capital or reduce debt.
The group manages its capital structure using a number of measures and taking into account its future strategic plans.
Such measures include its net interest cover and leverage ratios, which are included in its banking covenants.
Total capital is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.

The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance 82 Financial statements Investors Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21a Share based payments continued During the period the group had ten share based payment arrangements outstanding with employees to grant shares or share options.
The schemes are equity settled.
The expected volatility for the share option arrangements is based on historical volatility determined by the analysis of daily share price movements over the past ten years at the time of grant.
The options granted on 31st October 2007 under the Sharesave Plan are available to all UK employees.
The exercise price of the granted options is equal to the average market price of the shares less 20% at the date of invitation.
Options are conditional on the employee completing three years service the vesting period.
There are no other conditions.
The options are exercisable for a period of six months after vesting.
The Deferred Bonus Share Plan granted awards on 5th March 2007 in respect of performance in the 2006 financial year.
Awards are conditional on the employee completing two years service from the date of grant.
The Performance Share Plan PSP provides for the grant of other free shares in the form of conditional shares.
The second award under the PSP was made on 5th March 2007.
Shares in relation to the award will be released to participants at the end of an expected threeyear performance period, dependent upon the extent to which the performance condition has been satisfied.
The group uses the MonteCarlo model to value the award.
The group established a comparator group of 218 other companies from the FTSE 250.
The expected volatility under this model is calculated based on the daily movement of total shareholder return over the three years prior to the grant.
The correlation figure shown is the average against all other companies movements in total shareholder return in the comparator group.
If a company in the comparator group is acquired it has been removed from the performance criteria for vesting, although the remuneration committee can at their discretion replace it.
The dividend yield is set as zero as the value of dividends can only be awarded at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
The awards vest as follows: Performance of total shareholder return: % vesting Below median ranking 0 Median ranking 25 Upper quartile 100 Between median and upper quartile 25% to 100% pro-rata on a straight line basis The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance Financial statements 83 Investors 21a Share based payments continued A reconciliation of movements in the number of share options for the group can be summarised as follows: Deferred Bonus Share Plan Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 pence Vesting date 5th March 2007 36,521 36,521 nil March 2009 Performance Share Plan Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 pence Vesting date 2nd May 2006 205,056 31,976 173,080 nil May 2009 5th March 2007 284,809 284,809 nil March 2010 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Vesting date 2nd May 2006 215,089 10,033 205,056 nil May 2009 The Davis 1998 Share Option Scheme Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 pence Exercise period 10th October 2003 244,000 154,407 1,000 88,593 367.00 Oct 2006 Oct 2013 2nd June 2005 400,000 400,000 445.75 Jun 2008 Jun 2015 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 10th October 2003 269,500 25,500 244,000 367.00 Oct 2006 Oct 2013 2nd June 2005 460,000 60,000 400,000 445.75 June 2008 June 2015 The Davis Service Group Savings Related Share Option Scheme Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 pence Exercise period 15th October 2004 77,365 66,169 2,837 8,359 299.00 Dec 2007 May 2008 15th October 2004 181,630 3,176 11,963 166,491 299.00 Dec 2007 May 2010 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 15th October 2004 97,717 2,868 17,484 77,365 299.00 Dec 2007 May 2008 15th October 2004 217,084 3,346 32,108 181,630 299.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 The Davis Service Group Sharesave Plan Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2007 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2007 pence Exercise period 31st October 2006 400,273 426 51,396 348,451 396.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 31st October 2007 213,286 4,150 209,136 445.00 Dec 2010 May 2011 31st October 2007 163,090 3,775 159,315 445.00 Dec 2012 May 2013 Number of shares 1st January 31st December Exercise price 2006 Granted Exercised Lapsed 2006 pence Exercise period 31st October 2006 403,993 3,720 400,273 396.00 Dec 2009 May 2010 In total 224,178 options were exercised 154,407 at an exercise price of 3.67, 69,345 at an exercise price of 2.99 and 426 at an exercise price of 3.96.

Defined benefit plans Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates a registered defined benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benefits Scheme.
There was a triennial valuation in February 2007.
Overseas, the only significant pension arrangements are the defined benefit scheme operated in Ireland and unfunded schemes within Sweden, Germany and Norway.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The overall surplus on the funded plans is 11.6 million of which 12.9 million is in respect of the main UK plan.
There is a deficit of 17.3 million on unfunded plans.
Where a defined benefit scheme is administered by an insurance company with a collective of other companies and the insurance company is unable to assess the share of the groups pension obligation, the pension scheme has been accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance 92 Financial statements Investors Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32 Pension commitments continued The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, together with eight other defined benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2007 by qualified actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of IAS 19.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries were: 2007 2006 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 4.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 3.3 3.0 Discount rate 5.7 5.1 Inflation rate 3.2 3.0 Expected return on plan assets Equities 8.0 7.6 Bonds 5.6 5.0 Mortality rate Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on advice, published statistics and experience in each territory.
We updated our mortality assumptions during 2007 to tailor the longevity assumptions more closely to the anticipated experience of the schemes membership.
Different scaling factors are now used for different parts of the scheme membership: 85% for the executive members and 130% for the remaining members.
These assumptions are reflected in the life expectancies shown in the table below.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date, is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 21.3 20.1 Female 22.1 22.9 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, is as follows: 2007 2006 Male 21.8 21.3 Female 23.3 24.1 As at As at 31st December 31st December 2007 2006 m m The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows: Present value of obligations 216.0 232.7 Fair value of plan assets 210.3 190.6 Net liability recognised in balance sheet 5.7 42.1 Analysed as: Pension scheme surplus 12.9 Pension scheme deficit and unfunded schemes 18.6 42.1 5.7 42.1 The Davis Service Group Plc Report and Accounts 2007 Statements Governance Financial statements 93 Investors 32 Pension commitments continued The major categories of plan assets as a percentage of total plan assets are as follows: 2007 2006 % % European equities 36 43 North American equities 5 9 Asia Pacific equities 8 9 European bonds 15 15 European gilts 15 16 Cash 14 3 Other 7 5 100 100 Other assets consist principally of investments in a managed dynamic asset allocation fund.
The objectives of the fund are to hold a diversified basket of assets which is pro-actively changed to avoid the risks of a static portfolio.
The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the expected returns available on the assets underlying the current investment policy.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
Expected returns on equity and other investments reflect long-term real rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
