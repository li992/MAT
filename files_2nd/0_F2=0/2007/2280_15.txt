Testing MEM 44.5 42.9 Testing HSE 23.0 25.7 213.0 201.9 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the Business Units cash-generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the Business Units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows for all Business Units is 8.4% 2006: 8.7%.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash ows thereafter based on an estimated growth rate of 3.4%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on management forecasts.
Goodwill written off in the year includes the impairment of two North American heat treatment facilities 3.5m and the impairment of two UK Testing facilities 3.7m, and is as the result of difficult trading conditions in the related businesses.

An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 7.2m 2006: 6.9m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group had no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Group's financial instrument risk management activities are set out in the Group Business Review on pages 3 to 14.
Included in the Group's trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 44.5m 2006: 43.6m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2007 2006 m m Amounts overdue by up to 1 month 27.0 25.7 Amounts overdue by 1-2 months 12.6 11.2 Amounts overdue by 2-3 months 2.7 4.0 Amounts overdue by more than 3 months 2.2 2.7 44.5 43.6 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2007 2006 m m Balance at 1 January 6.9 6.3 Impairment losses recognised 4.7 4.5 Allowance acquired with subsidiaries 0.4 1.2 Amounts written off as uncollectable 2.4 2.0 Impairment losses reversed 2.8 3.1 Exchange differences 0.4.
Other financial assets continued In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the allowance for doubtful debts are individually impaired trade receivables with a balance of 9.0m 2006: 8.6m which have been placed under liquidation.
The impairment recognised represents the difference between the carrying amount of these trade receivables and the present value of the expected liquidation proceeds.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables 2007 2006 m m 3-12 months 4.4 5.4 Over 12 months 4.6 3.2 9.0 8.6 Bank and cash balances Bank and cash balances comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

Derivative financial instruments continued The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge material future transactions and cash ows.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not material either in 2007 or 2006.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
At the balance sheet date the Group had entered into foreign currency denominated cross currency swaps that were designated as a hedging instrument for the purposes of hedging the translation of its foreign operations.
The contracts are entered into either with both currencies at oating interest rates generally based on 3 month LIBOR interest rates or both currencies at xed interest rates.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 16.7m 2006: 15.4m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 1.5m 2006: 1.8m of such losses.
All losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 474.0m 2006: 348.0m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignicant.
