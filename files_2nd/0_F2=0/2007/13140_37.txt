The average number of people employed by discontinued operations during the year was 4,300 2006: 5,300.
6 Pension schemes A number of pension schemes are operated around the world.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The largest schemes, which cover the majority of employees, are in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.
Under these plans, employees are entitled to retirement benefits dependent on the number of years service provided.
The principal assumptions, for the purpose of valuation under IAS19 Employee Benefits, are determined for each scheme in conjunction with the respective schemes independent actuaries and are presented below as the weighted average of the various defined benefit pension schemes: 2007 2006 Discount rate 5.9% 5.3% Expected rate of return on scheme assets 7.1% 7.0% Expected rate of salary increases 4.4% 4.2% Inflation 3.1% 2.9% Future pension increases 3.2% 2.9% The expected rates of return on individual categories of scheme assets are determined by reference to relevant market indices.
The overall expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on the weighted average of each asset category.
Mortality assumptions used in assessing defined benefit obligations make allowance for future improvements in longevity and have been determined by reference to applicable mortality statistics and the actuaries expectations for each scheme.
The average life expectancies assumed in the valuation of the defined benefit obligations are set out below.

A total of 21m 2006: 20m was recognised as an expense in relation to defined contribution pension schemes, including 3m 2006: 3m in respect of discontinued operations.
Included in gains on disposals of discontinued operations are 11m 2006: nil of pension curtailment credits.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension schemes at the start and end of the year and the movements during the year were as follows: 2007 2006 Defined Fair value Net Defined Fair value Net benefit of scheme pension benefit of scheme pension obligations assets obligations obligations assets obligations m m m m m m At start of year 3,008 2,772 236 2,980 2,575 405 Service cost 78 78 94 94 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 157 157 144 144 Expected return on scheme assets 196 196 178 178 Actuarial gain 190 34 224 40 99 139 Contributions by employer 8383 6161 Contributions by employees 13 13 13 13 Benefits paid 114 110 4 106 102 4 Curtailment on disposal of operations 11 11 Exchange translation differences 27 30 3 77 52 25 At end of year 2,968 3,018 50 3,008 2,772 236 The net pension surplus of 50m at 31 December 2007 comprises schemes in surplus with net pension assets of 183m 2006: 20m and schemes in deficit with net pension obligations of 133m 2006: 256m.
As at 31 December 2007 the defined benefit obligations comprise 2,877m 2006: 2,921m in relation to funded schemes and 91m 2006: 87m in relation to unfunded schemes.
The weighted average duration of defined benefit scheme liabilities is 19 years 2006: 19 years.
Deferred tax liabilities of 51m 2006: 6m and deferred tax assets of 52m 2006: 92m are recognised in respect of the pension scheme surpluses and deficits respectively.
The fair value of scheme assets held as equities, bonds and other assets, and their expected rates of return, is shown below: 2007 2006 Expected rate Fair value Proportion Expected rate Fair value Proportion of return on of scheme of total of return on of scheme of total scheme assets scheme scheme assets scheme assets m assets assets m assets Equities 8.3% 1,904 63% 8.0% 1,857 67% Bonds 4.6% 970 32% 4.4% 777 28% Other 5.3% 144 5% 5.0% 138 5% Total 7.1% 3,018 100% 7.0% 2,772 100% The actual return on scheme assets for the year ended 31 December 2007 was 230m 2006: 277m.

Sensitivity analysis Valuation of Reed Elseviers pension scheme liabilities involves judgements about uncertain events, including the life expectancy of the members, salary and pension increases, inflation and the rate at which the future pension payments are discounted.
Estimates are used for each of these factors, determined in conjunction with independent actuaries.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions may materially affect future pension charges.
In particular, changes in assumptions for discount rates, inflation and life expectancies would have the following approximate effects on the annual net pension expense and the defined benefit pension obligations: m Increase decrease of 0.25% in discount rate: Decrease increase in annual net pension expense 6 Decrease increase in defined benefit pension obligations 133 Increase decrease of one year in assumed life expectancy: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 7 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 96 Increase decrease of 0.25% in the expected inflation rate: Increase decrease in annual net pension expense 6 Increase decrease in defined benefit pension obligations 106 Additionally, the annual net pension expense includes an expected return on scheme assets.
A 5% increase decrease in the market value of equity investments held by the defined benefit pension schemes would, absent any change in their expected long term rate of return, increase decrease the amount of the expected return on scheme assets by 8m and would increase decrease the amount of the net pension surplus by 95m.
