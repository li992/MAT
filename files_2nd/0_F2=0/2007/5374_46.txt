94 Emap plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Financial statements Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset against each other where they relate to the same tax jurisdiction.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for continuing operations for balance sheet purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax assets 6 6 Deferred tax liabilities 46 66 40 60 The Group has net deferred tax liabilities provided across the categories set out above totalling 40m 2006: 60m of which 8m 2006: 3m is due within one year and 32m 2006: 57m is due after more than one year.
Of the total net deferred tax liability, 6m 2006: 6m is disclosed as a non-current asset and 46m 2006: 66m is disclosed as a non-current liability.
The Group has tax trading losses in the US totalling 173m 2006: 200m carried forward at 31 March 2007.
The core of these losses was generated by a business principally disposed of in 2002 and historically these losses have been disclosed as items of unprovided deferred tax.
With the acquisition WGSN in 2006, it was anticipated that the previously unprovided US losses would begin to be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of 6m was recognised in 2006 covering the immediately anticipated profits.
The profitability of WGSN Inc. remains such that the 6m asset brought forward has been maintained at 31 March 2007.
This is shown within non-current assets in the balance sheet.
The Group has unprovided deferred tax on tax trading losses totalling 162m 2006: 197m of which 158m 2006: 184m is held in the US and 4m 2006: 13m in the UK.
The US losses can be carried forward for a period of 20 years from the date they arose.
The losses have varying expiry dates from 2016 to 2025.
The UK losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset on UK capital losses totalling 539m which can be carried forward indefinitely.
The Group has also deferred indefinitely UK capital gains totalling 90m arising on the disposal of business assets, which have been rolled into the acquisition cost of new businesses, and on the incorporation of WGSN Inc.
The Group has not recognised a deferred tax liability, as the relevant assets are not anticipated to be sold in the foreseeable future.
The sale of Emap France did not generate a tax liability due to the use of local French tax attributes and the availability of UK substantial shareholdings relief.
The Group also may sell its radio operations located in the Republic of Ireland during 2008.
No liability is anticipated to arise on sale due to the availability of UK substantial shareholdings relief.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on the unremitted earnings of continuing overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures as any remittances would not give rise to tax payable in the foreseeable future.
The UK budget announcement on 21 March 2007 included a number of changes to the UK tax rules to be phased in over the financial years 2009 2011 inclusive.
The announcements that will have the most immediate impact to UK companies are the reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% and the reduction in tax allowances on plant and machinery from 25% to 20% plant and 25% to 10% building fixtures for the 2009 financial year.
As at the balance sheet date these changes had not been substantially enacted and hence the deferred tax has not been restated to reflect the reduced tax rates that have been proposed.
If the deferred tax had been restated for the changes outlined above it would result in a reduction in the Groups balance sheet deferred tax liability from 40m to 37m with a corresponding reduction in the Group's tax charge from 22m to 19m.
