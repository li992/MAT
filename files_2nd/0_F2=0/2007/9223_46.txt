The function operates as a cost centre and manages the Groups treasury exposures to reduce risk in accordance with policies approved by the Board.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise: bank loans, overdrafts, loan notes, bonds, financial guarantee contracts, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors, trade creditors and accruals which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps.
The purpose of these transactions is to assist in the management of the Groups financial risk and to generate the desired effective currency and interest rate profile.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group has a 2 billion Euro Medium Term Note EMTN programme that is used to increase the flexibility of funding with regards to source, cost, size and maturity.
At 31 December 2007, three public Eurobond issues had been made under this programme: a 175 million 7.25 per cent bond, maturing July 2008: a 500 million 6.5 per cent bond, maturing July 2009 and a 250 million 7.125 per cent bond, maturing July 2012.
Several loan notes have been issued under the programme in a variety of currencies.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had one remaining loan note with a carrying value of 14.3 million 2006: two loan notes with a carrying value of 34.3 million.
Funds raised via the EMTN programme have been used to repay bank debt.
The main financial risks for the Group are: interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The Group also monitors the market price risk arising from all financial instruments.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on interest bearing loans and borrowings and on cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups policy for the year ended 31 December 2007 was to maintain a minimum of 25 per cent of net debt at fixed interest rates 2006: 100 per cent at floating rates and is therefore sensitive to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
At 31 December 2007, after taking account of interest rate and cross currency swaps, 268.5 million 2006: nil of the Groups gross borrowings were at fixed rates.
Foreign currency risk The Group carries out operations through a number of foreign enterprises.
The day to day transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currencies.
The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is monitored and reviewed regularly.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of its structural currency exposure that may arise from the translation of foreign currency assets by implementing economic hedges in foreign currencies.
These hedges are not part of documented net investment hedges.
In view of the expansion into Europe currently being undertaken by the Group it is anticipated that the level of foreign currency exposure will increase and that formal net investment hedges will be undertaken in the near future.
The Group has foreign currency borrowings, including a 500 million bond, some of which have been swapped into sterling.
The total carrying value of these borrowings at 31 December 2007 was 414.7 million 2006: 384.6 million of which 385.1 million 2006: 377.7 million was swapped into sterling.
Credit risk It is the Groups policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis.
Any changes to credit terms are assessed and authorised by senior management on an individual basis.
The Groups Telephone Betting division incurs a level of high rollers betting activity.
High rollers are individuals who place sizeable stakes.
The Group manages this activity and the associated risk exposure by utilising senior management expertise and setting maximum levels in respect of stakes placed.
Of the 72.6 million 2006: 12.0 million trade receivables balance, 71.2 million 2006: 10.8 million relates to the Groups Telephone Betting division.
The increase in 2007 in trade receivables and provision for impairment are in respect of high rollers betting activity.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and a guarantee financial asset, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counter party, with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
Credit risk in respect of cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is managed by restricting those transactions to banks that have a defined minimum credit rating and by setting an exposure ceiling per bank.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk arising from the financial guarantee contracts provided by the Group.
This risk is partly mitigated by the indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation for any loss incurred in connection with these guarantees.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility, through the use of borrowings with a range of maturities.
The Groups policy on liquidity is to ensure that there are sufficient medium and long-term committed borrowing facilities to meet the medium-term funding requirements.
At 31 December 2007, there were undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 558.6 million 2006: 555.8 million.
Total committed facilities had an average maturity of 2.9 years 2006: 3.9 years.
