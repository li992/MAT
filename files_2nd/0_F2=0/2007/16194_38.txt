b Factors affecting tax charge for period As the Group earns a significant portion of its profits in the UK, the tax rates applied to profit on ordinary activities in preparing the reconciliation below is the standard rate of UK corporation tax applicable to the Groups oil and gas activities plus the rate of Supplementary corporation tax SCT.
The difference between the total current tax charge shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax 30% plus the rate of SCT in respect of UK upstream profits 20% to the profit before tax is as follows: 2007 2006 000 000 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 114,203 263,332 Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at a combined standard UK corporation tax and SCT rate of 50% 2006: 50% 57,102 131,666 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 12,056 7,264 Net losses not recognised 50,706 19,635 Petroleum revenue tax PRT 9,654 22,001 UK corporation tax deductions for current PRT 4,827 11,001 Adjustments relating to prior years 5,613 290 Income taxed at a different rate 57,469 63,961 Group total tax expense for the year 61,609 105,894 The Groups profit before taxation will continue to be subject to jurisdictions where the effective rate of taxation differs from that in the UK.
Furthermore, unsuccessful exploration expenditure is often incurred in jurisdictions where the Group has no taxable profits, such that no related tax benefit arises.
Accordingly the Groups tax charge will continue to depend on the jurisdictions in which pre-tax profits and exploration costs written off arise.
The Group has tax losses of 131 million 2006: 124 million that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group.
