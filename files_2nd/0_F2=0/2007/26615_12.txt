These payments are deferred in the balance sheet and charged to the income statement on the administrative expenses line over the period in which they are committed to give their services to the Group.

Staff costs and employees continued c Pension benefits The Group operates various pension schemes throughout the world, including a number of funded defined benefit and contribution schemes.
Where appropriate, the fund assets, liabilities and pension costs for the year are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.
i Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contribution schemes are as follows: 2007 2006 $m $m Continuing operations 9 7 Defined contribution pension costs for discontinued operations totalled $17 million 2006: $10 million giving a total for the Group of $26 million 2006: $17 million ii Defined benefit schemes The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuations as at 31 March 2007 were: UK scheme US scheme Swiss scheme 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Discount rate 5.4 5.0 5.75 3.0 3.0 Price inflation 3.2 3.0 1.5 1.5 Expected return on plan assets 6.9 6.7 8.0 3.0 3.0 Future salary increases 5.8 5.6 5.0 5.0 5.0 Pension in payment increases 3.5 3.25 Deferred pensions increases 5.0 5.0 The US scheme was terminated during the year.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the Man Group plc Pension Fund formerly known as the ED & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a UK defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2005, using the Projected Unit Cost method.
This is a closed scheme and the current service cost is expected to increase as the members approach retirement.
For the UK scheme, the Group has agreed to contribute 34.2% of pensionable salaries each year until 2008.
The Group made an additional $19 million contribution in August 2006.
The following paragraphs discuss the key assumptions applied and sensitivities in the valuation of the Groups largest scheme, the UK scheme.
The discount rate is based on yields on high quality corporate bonds of appropriate duration.
The annualised yield on the index constructed by iBoxx of AA rated stocks of duration of 15 years or more was 5.4% at 31 March 2007 4.94% at 31 March 2006.
The mean term of the 15-year index falls short of the mean term of the liabilities of the Fund of around 20 years, but in the absence of suitable data, the iBoxx yields are thought to be an appropriate guide.
The expected return on plan assets is based on the market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Investment market conditions suggest an expected return on equities of around 8.0%, expected bond returns of around 5.2%, and expected return on other plan assets hedge funds, cash of around 7.6%.
The pension increase entitlement for the majority of members in the Fund is RPI subject to a minimum of 3.0% per annum and a maximum of 5.0% per annum.
Pension increases have been assumed to be at a rate of 3.5% per annum reflecting the possibility that future increases are likely to be higher than price inflation.

Staff costs and employees continued In light of recent experience, which suggests that there has been lower mortality than previously assumed, it is thought appropriate to update the mortality tables to allow for the general improvements being experienced.
As a result, the table of mortality rates PA92C05 with no age rating is now being used.
In addition, allowance is made for future improvements in mortality rates by reducing the discount rate by 0.25% per annum, which increases the balance sheet liabilities.
In practical terms, the table below sets out the expectations of life for male and female members currently aged 60 and for those who will be 60 years old in 20 years time.
Current life expectancy Life expectancy in 20 years time years years Male aged 60 24.4 25.8 Female aged 60 27.5 28.8 The figures presented below make no allowance for the withdrawal of Brokerage employees as a result of the planned IPO.
The current expectation is that this will take place with effect from 1 July 2007.
The trustees of the Fund have not yet agreed the terms on which any transfer to the new scheme to be established by Brokerage will be made.

Share-based payment charges for discontinued operations totalled $22 million 2006: $19 million giving a total for the Group of $65 million 2006: $52 million.
This expense was based on the fair value of the share-based payment transactions when contracted.
All of the expense arose under employee share awards made within the Groups share-based remuneration schemes.
Details of these schemes may be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 72-80.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to repurchase or settle the options in cash.
Man Group plc Annual Report 2007 102 Financial Statements 5.
Staff costs and employees continued The fair value of share options and awards are calculated using a binomial lattice model that takes into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of non-market based performance conditions.
Demographic assumptions include forfeiture and early vesting behaviours that are based upon historic observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the year to employees of both continuing and discontinued operations, and the assumptions used in the calculations, are as follows: Executive Other share employee option share option Performance Co-investment scheme schemes share plan scheme Grant dates 21 6 2006 3 7 2006-1 8 2006 16 6 2005 19 6 2006-30 3 2007 Weighted average share price at grant date 738c 767c 735c 763c Weighted average exercise price at grant date 738c 626c Share options awards made in the year 1,773,648 1,251,786 4,421,958 11,848,344 Vesting period years 3 2-5 4 4 Expected share price volatility 30.0% 30.0% Dividend yield 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% Risk-free rate 4.8% 4.9% Expected option life years 8.5 3.0 Number of shares options assumed to vest 1,773,648 1,016,687 4,421,958 10,674,769 Average fair value per option share granted 238c 194c 668c 619c The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the last 10 years.
The expected option life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon US and UK where appropriate government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.
It is assumed that the performance conditions applicable to the executive share option scheme and performance share plan will be met in full.
For the executive share option scheme, it is assumed that 5% of options per year are subject to early exercise, and in addition, provided there is a gain of 50% on the exercise price, it is assumed that 50% of remaining option holders will exercise per year.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on a profit for the year of $1,285 million 2006: $1,014 million for continuing and discontinued operations, and a profit for the year of $175 million 2006: $54 million for discontinued operations.
The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share for continuing and discontinued operations is based on 1,852,685,662 2006: 1,804,148,292 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after excluding the shares owned by the Man Group plc employee trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The diluted earnings per share is based on a profit for the year of $1,310 million 2006: $1,047 million for continuing and discontinued operations, and a profit for the year of $175 million 2006: $54 million for discontinued operations.
The calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share for continuing and discontinued operations is based on 2,051,372,034 2006: 2,055,637,782 ordinary shares, calculated as shown in the following table: 2007 2006 Total Weighted Total Weighted Number average Number average millions millions millions millions Number of shares at 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2005 1,845.9 1,845.9 1,846.3 1,846.2 Issues of shares 78.1 52.1 51.0 20.4 Repurchase and cancellation of own shares 44.0 22.0 51.3 33.0 Number of shares at 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006 1,880.0 1,876.0 1,846.0 1,833.6 Shares owned by employee trusts 22.1 23.3 25.2 29.4 Basic number of shares 1,857.9 1,852.7 1,820.8 1,804.2 Share awards under incentive schemes 52.9 54.7 57.6 61.2 Employee share options 11.9 4.2 11.4 3.0 Exchangeable bonds 116.0 139.8 187.2 187.2 Dilutive number of shares 2,038.7 2,051.4 2,077.0 2,055.6 In addition to the statutory earnings per share on continuing operations and on total operations measures, underlying earnings per share figures are shown.

Where the required disclosure is applicable to more than one balance sheet item, or is not applicable to any specific balance sheet item, the information is given below: a The following table summarises the Groups currency exposure arising from unmatched net monetary assets or liabilities not denominated in the functional currency of each Group entity: 2007 2006 Net assets Net assets liabilities liabilities $m $m US dollar 2 8 Sterling 90 59 Euro 23 70 Swiss franc 51 35 Japanese yen 14 122 Hong Kong dollar 2 64 Australian dollar 2 154 Other 7 7 77 189 b Fair value is equivalent to book value for all financial assets and liabilities, except for borrowings and certain repurchase contracts in Brokerage.
The comparison of fair value to book value for borrowings is shown in Note 22 and for repurchase contracts in Notes 15,17 and 21. c Brokerage uses netting agreements for certain transactions including stock lending, stock borrowing, repurchase, reverse repurchase, and similar transactions.
Such transactions are performed under standard market agreements.
Derivative transactions for clients are transacted under the Groups standard terms of business in each location which provide for netting in the event of default.
Over-the-counter transactions are performed mostly under International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements which are negotiated bilaterally and provide for a single net settlement in the event of default of either counterparty.
d Brokerage acts as a matched principal broker in stock lending and borrowing, repurchase and reverse repurchase and similar collateralised financing transactions.
These transactions involve the receipt of stock against the payment of cash collateral and or the pledge of non-cash collateral or the pledge of stock against the receipt of cash and or non-cash collateral.
Cash collateral paid under such agreements is shown on the balance sheet in trade receivables Note 18 as secured stock lending and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Cash collateral received under such transactions is recorded in trade payables Note 21 as secured stock borrowing and securities purchased under agreements to resell.
Transactions where stock is pledged against the receipt of non-cash collateral or where stock is received against the pledge of non-cash collateral are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The non-cash collateral pledged in such transactions is recorded in short term investments where the Group has purchased and owns such non-cash collateral.
The non-cash collateral is not recorded on the balance sheet where it has been borrowed and subsequently re-pledged.
Substantially all of the non-cash collateral received under such agreements is passed back to counterparties as collateral for other stock lending type transactions.
Substantially all of the investments in equities and bonds, recorded in short term investments Note 20 are passed as collateral to counterparties involved in such transactions.
At 31 March 2007, the division had paid net margin of $917 million $2006: $727 million to its counterparties and received net margin of $490 million 2006: $435 million from its counterparties.

Intangible assets continued a Impairment tests for goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units equivalent to each of the Groups acquisitions categorised by business segment.
The carrying amounts are presented below: 2007 2006 $m $m Asset Management: Glenwood 76 76 RMF 621 621 Man Investments Australia 88 76 773 Brokerage: GNI 52 Fox 7 Union Cal 1 FADC 1 61 785 834 To determine whether impairment exists, the carrying value of goodwill is compared with the assets recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
All of the recoverable amounts were calculated based on value in use.
To calculate the value in use, an estimate of future cash flows from each acquisition and expectations about possible variations in the amount of these cash flows have been considered, including where acquired businesses have been integrated into existing businesses.
An appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate is applied to these future cash flows, resulting in a balance representing their value in use, which is compared with the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment exists.
The key assumptions used by management for value in use calculations for each acquisition, by business segment, include: Rates p. a Asset Management: Net management fee growth 5% Net performance fee growth 0% Discount rate 10% Brokerage: Growth rate 0% Discount rate 10% Discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect estimates that the market would expect of an investment with an equivalent risk profile.
A range of growth rates is used to simulate expected best and worst case scenarios, taking into consideration past performance and expectations for market development.
The growth rates used in the discounted cash flow models are conservative in that they are lower than managements expectations and those included in the budgets for future years.
In Asset Management, even if the growth rates applied to net management fee income were reduced to zero, net performance fee income excluded altogether and the discount rate increased to 15%, there would still be no impairment to goodwill.
As a result of these calculations, no impairment was identified.
b Intangible assets with finite useful lives Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives.
In addition these are reviewed for impairment if there are any indications of impairment.
No indications of impairment were evidenced during the year.

The Directors consider that to give full particulars of all associate and joint venture undertakings would result in a statement of excessive length.
Further details are given in Principal Group Investments on page 134.
The investment in BlueCrest includes goodwill of $198 million 2006: $174 million.
The increase in the year relates to currency movements.
This is tested for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the assets recoverable amount on an annual basis at the balance sheet date.
A value in use basis is used to calculate the recoverable amount by estimating the future cash flows for net management fee income and net performance fee income and discounting them at an appropriate risk-adjusted pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate applied is 10% and net management fee income is assumed to grow at 5% per annum and net performance fee income is assumed to remain constant no growth.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the balances related to tax levied by the same taxation authority, and there is an intention to settle the balances net.

The carrying value of loans to employees approximate their fair values and are based on cash flows discounted using an effective interest rate of 5.5% 2006: 5.0%.
Non-current receivables of $264 million attributable to Brokerage operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations Note 8 in the year ended 31 March 2007.
Reverse repurchase contracts are held at amortised cost and the fair value of the contracts are determined by reference to the discounted future interest and principal cash payments on the matching bonds held as collateral.
In the comparative period the fair value was $1,922 million.
Fund product financing and other loans to external parties are provided at commercial rates of interest and the carrying values reflect their fair values.
The interest rate and currency profile of non-current receivables are as follows: 2007 2006 Non-interest Non-interest Floating Fixed bearing Total Floating Fixed bearing Total $m$m$m$m $m $m $m $m US dollar 2 10 12 12 1,951 2 1,965 Sterling 6 20 26 15 15 Other currencies 22 66 8 10 22 40 12 1,951 23 1,986 The weighted average effective interest rate applicable to fund financing and other loans to external parties is 5.0% 2006: 3.9%.
The weighted average maturity or repricing date whichever is earlier of non-current receivables is 3.4 years 2006: 1.8 years.
The maximum credit risk exposure of non-current receivables is equivalent to the fair value of the loans.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to non-current receivables are not significant.

Interest earned on these accounts is included in revenue in the income statement.
The weighted average effective rate of interest on fixed rate loans is 6.8% 2006: 3.7%.
Credit risk disclosures with respect to trade receivables and loans to fund products may be found in the Credit risk section of the Financial Review, on pages 53-55 of this Annual Report.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to current trade and other receivables are limited due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated.
As a result, the Directors believe that no further credit risk disclosure is required.

Forester Limited, a special purpose entity details in Note 33, has issued guaranteed exchangeable bonds of 400 million at par value, guaranteed by Man Group plc and which mature in November 2009.
The bonds have the following features: 1 a coupon of 3.75%, paid semi-annually: 2 holders have the option at any time to exchange for Man Group plc ordinary shares at an initial exchange price of 12.82 2.13 post the sub-division of the ordinary shares : 3 Forester Limited can redeem the bonds early at their principal amount together with accrued interest at any time on or after 15 days after the fifth anniversary of the issue of the bonds if on not less than 20 days out of a period of 30 consecutive days the Man Group plc share price exceeds 130% of the then current exchange price or at any time if less than 15% of the total issue remains outstanding: and 4 Forester Limited has the option to redeem either on maturity or early redemption the bonds for a fixed number of shares.
On 5 November 2004, the terms and conditions of the exchangeable bonds were amended to remove the option, which Forester Limited had, to settle in cash rather than shares, upon exercise of an exchange right by a bondholder.
On 20 August 2006, 38% of the Groups exchangeable bonds were converted, following an offer by the Group to pay a fixed cash sum to bondholders.
The cost of the cash incentive offer amounted to $12 million and this has been expensed within the finance expense line of the income statement.
The remaining bonds are expected to convert within one year as a result of the Groups call option, which is exercisable in November 2007 and therefore the balance of exchangeable bonds outstanding is classified as amounts falling due within one year.

Borrowings continued The fair value of the exchangeable bonds is determined by reference to their listed price on the London Stock exchange.
The fair values of private placement notes excluding the effect of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps held as hedges are determined by reference to independent third-party issuers of similar debt instruments that have similar credit ratings.
Bank loans, overdrafts and floating rate notes are subject to floating rates of interest and the carrying amounts reflect their fair values.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates, including and excluding the effect of interest rate swaps, were as follows: 2007 2006 Including Excluding Including Excluding swaps swaps swaps swaps % % % % Bank loans and overdrafts n a 6.3 Private placement notes senior debt 6.2 5.4 5.7 5.3 Private placement notes subordinated debt 7.5 5.9 7.1 5.9 Floating rate notes subordinated debt n a 6.6 n a 6.2 Exchangeable bonds 8.7 7.7 7.7 7.7 The Groups fixed rate borrowings have been swapped to floating rate for the duration of the fixed interest period.
All of the Groups borrowings are thus subject to floating rate charges, exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

In addition, 50,000 unlisted deferred Sterling shares 2006: 50,000 with a par value of 1 per share 2006: 1 per share were issued on 29 July 2004.
These shares are necessary to continue to comply with Section 118 of the Companies Act 1985, following the redenomination of the ordinary share capital into ordinary shares of 18 US cents each on that date.
The deferred Sterling shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no rights to attend, speak or vote at any general meeting and no right to participate in any distribution in a winding up except for a return of the nominal value of the shares after the return on the nominal amount paid up on every other class of share and the distribution of 100,000,000,000 to every other holder of every other class of share.
It is intended that these shares will always be held by a director of the Company.

Contingent liabilities Man Financial Inc. a US subsidiary of the Group, was served on 8 May 2006 with a Complaint by the receiver for Philadelphia Alternate Asset Fund PAAF and associated entities.
PAAF investors incurred trading losses as a result of alleged wrongdoing by a trading manager of PAAF.
Man Financial acted as one of the brokers to PAAF, executing and clearing trading instructions given by PAAF, and as such does not consider that it is responsible for the losses suffered by PAAF investors.
Accordingly, Man Financial will vigorously defend the proceedings brought against it.
It continues to be the case that this matter is not expected to have a material financial impact on the Man Group.
