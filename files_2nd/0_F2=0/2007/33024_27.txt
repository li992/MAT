The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products, pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.

A risk-adjusted discount rate of 12% has been applied to the projections.
Tests on a similar basis are also conducted at geographic-specific levels using proportionate allocations of cross-functional assets.
