Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes consisting of the main scheme for UK based employees and several smaller schemes for overseas employees.
All of the schemes are wholly funded and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Main scheme The main scheme comprises two parts: a a defined benefit scheme, which from 1 October 1999 was closed to new joiners.
The contributions to the scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of regular valuations.
The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 6 April 2005. b a defined contribution scheme was opened upon the closure of the defined benefit scheme, to new joiners.
Employee contributions are matched by an employer contribution up to a ceiling of 5% of basic salary.
The pension cost charge for the year of the Groups defined contribution schemes amounted to 1,060,000 2006: 1,501,000.
Other schemes The Group operates defined benefit and insured defined benefit arrangements in Holland and Norway.
The assets of insured schemes are insurance contracts which guarantee the pensions secured to date and an annual valuation of the scheme amends the contribution rate each year.
Defined benefit schemes The major assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit scheme liabilities under IAS 19 Employment benefits were: 2007 2006 % % Key assumptions used: Discount rate 5.4 5.0 Expected return on scheme assets 6.6 6.6 Expected rate of salary increases 4.2 3.9 Future pension increases 3.3 2.9 The mortality assumptions adopted at 31 March 2007 imply the following life expectancies: 2007 2006 Remaining Remaining years years Males currently aged 40 44 44 Females currently aged 40 47 47 Males currently aged 65 20 20 Females currently aged 65 23 23 The expected long term return on cash is based on cash deposit rates available at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities and property have been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
