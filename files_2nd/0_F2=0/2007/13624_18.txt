ANNUAL REPORT 46 & ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued INTANGIBLE ASSETS i Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries.
In respect of acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions would be recognised directly in the income statement.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP on transition.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 has not been reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost or deemed cost less any impairment losses.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at each balance sheet date and is allocated to cash-generating units.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying value of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
ii Research & development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Development costs incurred after the point at which the commercial and technical feasibility of the product have been proven, and the decision to complete the development has been taken and resources made available, are capitalised.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Development expenditure has an estimated useful life of 5 years and is written off on a straight-line basis.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
The useful life of each of these assets is assessed based on discussions with the management of the acquired business and takes account of the differing natures of each of the intangibles acquired.
The assessed useful lives of intangibles acquired so far range from 1 year for order back log at acquisition to 15 years for long standing customer relationships.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 10% to 33% Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property that had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
LEASES Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases are initially recognised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and liability, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in arriving at the operating profit.
TAXATION Income tax on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes and the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profits.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Accounting policies continued INVENTORY AND WORK IN PROGRESS Inventory and work in progress is valued at the lower of cost, on a first in, first out basis, and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses which are required to bring inventories to their present location and condition.
The net realisable value in respect of old and slow moving inventory is assessed by reference to historic usage patterns and forecast future usage.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term with an original maturity less than three months deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form part of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
EQUITY Equity comprises issued equity capital, share premium, reserves and retained earnings.
When issued equity capital is repurchased, the amount paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
Repurchased shares are debited direct to equity and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
PROVISIONS A provision for warranties is recognised when the underlying products or services are sold.
The provision is based on historical warranty cost data, known issues and management expectations of future costs.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS i Pension plans The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to these schemes in accordance with qualified actuaries recommendations.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised.
In respect of all actuarial gains and losses that arise after that date in calculating the Groups obligation in respect of the plan, these are recognised in equity.
Interest on pension scheme liabilities has been recognised within financing expenses and the expected return on scheme assets within financing income in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The costs for these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
ii Share-based payment transactions The Rotork Share Option Scheme allows certain employees to acquire shares in Rotork p. l. c. This scheme is now closed and the last grant of new options took place in 2004.
Details of the scheme are given in note 19.
The fair value of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
The Rotork Sharesave Plan, introduced in 2004, offers certain employees the opportunity to purchase shares in Rotork p. l. c. at a discounted price compared with the market price at the time of grant.
The fair value of the right option is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period between grant and maturity.
The right option reaches maturity when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled.
The fair value of the grant is measured using a Black-Scholes model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the rights were granted.
The Rotork Long-Term Incentive Plan grants awards of shares to executive directors and senior managers.
These awards may vest after a period of three or four years dependent upon both market and non-market performance conditions being met.
Details of the grants are given in note 19.
This plan gives share awards or cash awards of equivalent value to the share awards dependent upon the employees country of residence at date of grant.
The fair value of the award is measured at grant date, using a Monte Carlo simulation model which takes into account the market based performance criteria, and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of the award is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity for the share settled award and a provision within employee benefits for the cash settled award.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to exclude options that do not vest as a result of non-market performance conditions not being met.
In the case of the cash awards, the liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value recognised in the income statement, spread equally over the vesting period.
All grants under these schemes made after 7 November 2002 have been accounted for under IFRS 2.
Those made before this date are accounted for under UK GAAP and any accruals in respect of these schemes are held in employee benefits.
ANNUAL REPORT 48 & ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED iii Long-term service leave The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service leave is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
iv Other employee incentive schemes In addition to the above schemes the Group offers a number of other bonus and incentive schemes to employees around the world.
The costs of these schemes are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
This includes the Share Incentive Plan and Overseas Profit Linked Share Scheme both of which are a known liability at the year end.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risk arising from operational and financing activities.
These are the only form of derivative financial instruments used by the Group.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
However, forward contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Forward exchange contracts are recognised initially at cost and then subsequently re-measured at fair value.
Where a forward exchange contract is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised liability, a firm commitment or a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the forward contract is recognised directly in equity.
Any effective cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction still is expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss held in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
DIVIDENDS Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when they are paid.
Final dividends are recorded in the financial statements in the period which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies the Board has made the following judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
i Impairment of Goodwill Determining whether Goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of CGUs to which Goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation involves an estimation of the future cash flows of CGUs and also the selection of appropriate discount rates, which involves judgement, to calculate present values.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 11. ii Dened benefit Pension Scheme Liabilities Determining the value of the future defined benefit obligation requires judgement in respect of the assumptions used to calculate present values.
These include future mortality, discount rate, inflation and salary increases.
Management makes these judgements in consultation with an independent actuary.
Details of the estimates and judgements in respect of the current year are in note 19.
Analysis of revenue, profit and net assets The primary format used for segmental reporting is by business segment as this reflects the internal management structure and reporting of the Group.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated expenses comprise corporate expenses and unallocated assets and liabilities comprise cash, borrowings, tax assets and liabilities respectively.
Intra group trading is determined on an arms length basis.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS The Group comprises the following business segments: Controls the design, manufacture and sale of electric valve actuators Fluid Systems the design, manufacture and sale of heavy duty pneumatic and hydraulic valve actuators Gears the design, manufacture and sale of gearboxes, adaption and ancillaries for the valve industry GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS Rotork has a worldwide presence in all three business segments through its subsidiary selling offices and through an agency network.

Acquisition of subsidiaries On 13 January 2006 Rotork Italia Srl acquired all of the business and assets of Omag Snc when it acquired a newly set up company for up to 1,061,000.
924,000 was paid on completion and a further 137,000 was paid during 2006.
The company manufactures and sells heavy duty quarter-turn and multiturn gearboxes.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of consolidation.
In the 11 months to 31 December 2006 the subsidiary contributed 2,439,000 to Group revenue and 320,000 to the consolidated net profit for the year before the 71,000 amortisation of intangible charge.
Goodwill has arisen on this acquisition as a result of the value attributed to staff expertise and the assembled workforce which did not meet the recognition criteria for an intangible asset and post acquisition synergies within the Gears division.
Due to a lack of reliable information for the part month prior to acquiring the assets, full year proforma financial results are not given in these financial statements although they would not be expected to differ significantly from the results post acquisition.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.

The Group continues to expect its effective rate of corporation tax to be slightly higher than the standard UK rate due to higher rates of tax in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and India.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax liability for temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries.
Rotork p. l. c. controls the dividend policies of its subsidiaries and subsequently the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences.
It is not practical to quantify the unprovided temporary differences as acknowledged within paragraph 40 of IAS 12.

IMPAIRMENT TESTS FOR GOODWILL Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash generating units CGUs identified according to business segment.
A segment level summary of goodwill allocation is presented below.
2007 2006 Controls 5,839 5,717 Fluid Systems 8,513 8,102 Gears 7,175 7,128 21,527 20,947 The recoverable amounts of all CGUs are based on value in use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections and are based on actual operating results and the latest Group three year plan.
The three year plan is based on managements view of the future and experience of past performance.
Cash flows for the remainder of the next twenty years are extrapolated using a 2% growth rate which reflects the long-term nature of many of the markets the Group serves.
This rate has been consistently bettered in the past so is believed to represent a prudent estimate.
A pre-tax discount rate of 9%, being the Groups weighted average cost of capital, has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
On this basis no impairment write downs are required.

The Group estimates that contributions to the Groups defined benefit pension schemes payable during 2008 will be approximately 2,300,000.

By way of example the respective mortality tables indicate the following life expectancy: 2007 2006 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 LIFE EXPECTANCY AT AGE 65 CURRENT AGE MALE FEMALE MALE FEMALE 65 22.7 25.3 18.6 21.6 45 25.7 28.2 19.0 22.0 ANNUAL REPORT 64 & ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 CONTINUED 19.
Employee benefits continued Defined contribution pension liabilities The Group makes a contribution to a number of defined contribution plans around the world to provide benefits for employees upon retirement.
Total expense relating to these plans in the year was 1,030,000 2006: 1,135,000. ii SHARE BASED PAYMENTS Volatility assumptions for equity based payments The expected volatility of all equity compensation benefits is based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of each benefit, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
a Share option scheme At 1 January 1995 the Group established a share option programme for employees.
The allocation of options was linked to the completion of 5 years service.
In accordance with the programme, once vested the options grant the right to purchase shares at the market price they were at the date of grant.
Exercise prices range from 278p to 387p.
Options vest after three years and expire ten years after being granted.
Only the 2003 and 2004 grants occurred after 7 November 2002, the start date for recognition under IFRS 2.
Therefore only charges in respect of these grants have been made to the accounts in accordance with IFRS 2 and the relevant disclosures made below.
Additionally, four share option arrangements granted before 7 November 2002 exist.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The intrinsic value of shares vested as at 31 December 2007 is 296,000 2006: 163,000.
The Group received proceeds of 528,000 in respect of the 142,173 options exercised during the year: 7,000 was credited to share capital and 521,000 to share premium see note 16.
The options were exercised throughout the year at prices between 285p and 387p.
Employee benefits continued b Sharesave plan Following shareholder approval of the Sharesave plan at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM on 18 May 2000, the first offer was made to employees in 2004.

All the offers to date were made at a 20% discount to market price at the time.
There are no performance criteria for the Sharesave plan.
Employees are given the option of joining either the 3 year plan or the 5 year plan.

ANNUAL REPORT 66 & ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 CONTINUED 19.
Employee benefits continued c Long-term incentive plan The Long-term incentive plan LTIP is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of four year performance periods for awards made up to and including 2005 and the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
The performance period for 2006 and future awards under the plan has been reduced to three years.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
For the awards made up to and including 2005 this will be 40% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.4% to the vesting percentage.
From the 2006 award onwards, the actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior managers in each year from 2000 to 2007.
The performance period for the 2003 award ended at 31 December 2006.
Messrs. Hewitt Bacon and Woodrow as independent actuaries have certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was on the 88th percentile position and the Groups earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The performance period for the 2004 award ended at 31 December 2007.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries have certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 100% vesting of this award as the Companys position relative to the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period was above the 75th percentile and the Groups earnings per share growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The awards will vest during 2008.

Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
i CREDIT RISK Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and monies on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 60-75% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: CARRYING AMOUNT 2007 2006 Trade receivables 44,262 37,385 Other receivables 5,595 4,839 Cash and cash equivalents 38,253 28,460 Currency swap deposit 2,975 3,638 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: Assets 95 291 Liability 639 1 Total 90,541 74,612 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: CARRYING AMOUNT 2007 2006 Sterling 4,658 4,505 US dollar 7,408 7,721 Euro 24,444 18,213 Other 7,752 6,946 Total 44,262 37,385 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 69 22.
Financial instruments continued Provisions against trade receivables The aging of trade receivables and associated provision for impairment at the reporting date was: GROSS PROVISION GROSS PROVISION 2007 2007 2006 2006 Not past due 31,366 13 28,050 47 Past due 0-30 days 9,296 48 5,915 21 Past due 31-60 days 2,520 47 2,381 92 Past due 61-90 days 889 25 806 126 Past due more than 91 days 799 475 781 262 44,870 608 37,933 548 ii LIQUIDITY RISK Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses, but it maintains a 2m overdraft facility on which interest would be payable at LIBOR plus 100 basis points.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: ANALYSIS OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOW MATURITIES CARRYING CONTRACTUAL LESS THAN MORE THAN 31 DECEMBER 2007 AMOUNT CASH FLOWS 12 MONTHS 1-2 YEARS 2-5 YEARS 5 YEARS Secured bank loans 54 63 33 30 Finance lease liabilities 228 246 100 74 72 Trade and other payables 40,705 40,705 40,705 Non-redeemable preference shares 45 45 45 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: Outflow 639 19,796 19,796 Inflow 95 8,542 8,542 41,576 69,397 69,176 104 72 45 ANALYSIS OF CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOW MATURITIES CARRYING CONTRACTUAL LESS THAN MORE THAN 31 DECEMBER 2006 AMOUNT CASH FLOWS 12 MONTHS 1-2 YEARS 2-5 YEARS 5 YEARS Secured bank loans 501 536 472 32 32 Overdraft 62 62 62 Finance lease liabilities 160 173 87 45 41 Trade and other payables 32,758 32,758 32,758 Non-redeemable preference shares 45 45 45 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging: Outflow 1 202 202 Inflow 291 6,9956,995 33,236 40,771 40,576 77 73 45 ANNUAL REPORT 70 & ACCOUNTS 2007 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 CONTINUED 22.
Financial instruments continued iii MARKET RISKS Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
a Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk primarily are US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 80% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than sterling, the Group ensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level, by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates where necessary to address short-term imbalances.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts hedging forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2007 was a 544,000 liability 2006: 290,000 asset comprising an asset of 95,000 2006: 291,000 and a liability of 639,000 2006: 1,000.
Changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
All forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2007 mature within one year.
The Group entered into a currency swap in February 2005 when 19.0m was borrowed to finance the acquisition of PC Intertechnik, linked to a deposit of 6.2m, at an exchange rate of 11.444 1.000.
The 19m was paid to Rotork Controls Deutschland GmbH in a form of redeemable equity as this company purchased the assets of PC Intertechnik.
This swap was entered into to protect the Group from currency movements on the repayment of equity from Germany.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of the US dollar against sterling would have had a 200,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax and a one euro cent movement against sterling would have had a 200,000 impact on the Groups profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: AVERAGE RATE CLOSING RATE 2007 2006 2007 2006 US dollar 2.01 1.84 1.99 1.96 Euro 1.45 1.47 1.36 1.48 b Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All foreign currency cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and where rates are fixed the period of the fix is generally no more than 1 month.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns sterling deposits which are made on a floating LIBOR based rate and short-term overdrafts in foreign currencies which are also on a floating rate.
The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank loans overdrafts bearing interest rates fixed by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 3.9% per annum.
The weighted average period for which interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is one year.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2007 2006 In one year or less 118 589 In more than one year but not more than two years 98 68 In more than two years but not more than five years 66 66 In more than five years 45 45 Total 327 768 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2007 71 22.
Financial instruments continued At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest bearing financial instruments was as follows: Fixed rate instruments CARRYING AMOUNT 2007 2006 Financial assets 24,058 20,435 Financial liabilities 228 295 23,830 20,140 All foreign currency cash deposits are held on fixed rates of interest in the UK.
All other cash amounts are on floating rates or overnight rates based on the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
iv CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Groups net funds at the balance sheet date were: 2007 2006 Total borrowings 327 706 Cash and cash equivalents note 15 38,253 28,398 Group net funds 37,926 27,692 v FAIR VALUES The fair values of financial assets and liabilities, together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet, are as follows: CARRYING CARRYING AMOUNT FAIR VALUE AMOUNT FAIR VALUE 2007 2007 2006 2006 Trade receivables 44,262 44,262 37,385 37,385 Other receivables 5,595 5,595 4,839 4,839 Cash and cash equivalents 38,253 38,253 28,460 28,460 Currency swap deposit 2,975 2,975 3,638 3,638 Forward exchange contracts: Assets 95 95 291 291 Liabilities 639 639 1 1 Currency swap loan 2,975 2,975 3,638 3,638 Secured loans 54 54 501 501 Preference shares 45 45 45 45 Finance lease liabilities 228 228 160 160 Trade and other payables 40,705 40,705 32,758 32,758 Bank overdrafts 62 62 46,534 46,534 37,448 37,448 As the elements of the currency swap can legally be offset, although the values of the loan and deposit are shown above they have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet.
The forward exchange contracts are designated hedges, the assets are held at fair value through profit and loss and the liabilities at amortised cost.
Basis for determining fair values The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the contracts value date, and gains and losses taken to equity.
No contracts value date is greater than one year from the year end.
Secured loans As the loans have a flexible repayment schedule, and may be paid down in less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
