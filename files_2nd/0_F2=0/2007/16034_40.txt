The Directors consider the only class of asset containing significant credit risk is trade receivables.
The average credit term for sales of goods is 56 days 2006: 55 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 21.5m 2006: 20.4m, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest at 4% above the National Westminster Bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.
The Group has provided fully for all receivables outstanding over 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables between 30 and 90 days beyond agreed terms are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experiences.
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts THE GROUP 2007 2006 m m Balance at 1 January 20.4 19.0 Amounts written off during the year 6.6 4.4 Increase in allowance recognised in profit and loss 7.7 5.8 Balance at 31 December 21.5 20.4 In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are unprovided against debtors with a carrying amount of 22.8m 2006: 15.7m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.

The impairment represents the difference between the carrying amount of the specific trade receivable and the amount it is anticipated will be recovered.
None of the Companys debts are overdue.
The Directors do not consider there to be any significant credit risk, as the majority of the debt is due from subsidiaries.
