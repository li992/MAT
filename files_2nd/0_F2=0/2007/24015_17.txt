b Principal accounting policies The policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the year.
i Fixed assets investments As an investment trust, the Company measures its fixed asset investments at fair value through profit or loss and treats all transactions on the realisation and revaluation of investments held as fixed assets, as transactions on the Capital Account.
Investment purchases are recognised on the relevant trade date, inclusive of expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of the investments.
Investment sales are also recognised on the trade date, after deducting expenses incidental to the sales.
Listed investments are valued at bid value at the close of business on the relevant date on the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Investments which are not listed or which are not frequently traded are stated at Directors best estimate of fair value.
In arriving at their estimate, the Directors make use of recognised valuation techniques and may take account of recent arms length transactions in the same or similar investment instruments.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated, investments may be carried at cost less any provision for impairment.
With respect specifically to investments in private equity, whether through funds or partnerships, the Directors rely on unaudited valuations of the underlying unlisted investments as supplied by the managers of those funds or partnerships.
The Directors regularly review the principles applied by the managers to those valuations to ensure they are in compliance with the above policies.
ii Borrowings Interest-bearing debenture stock, loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs, irrespective of the duration of the instrument.
The fair market value of the long-term debenture stock is stated in note 17 on the accounts.
Finance charges, including interest, are accrued using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period.
See v below for allocation of finance charges within the Income Statement.
iii Foreign currency Foreign currency assets and liabilities are expressed in sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investment securities, dividend income, interest income and expenses are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the respective dates of such transactions.
Exchange profits and losses on fixed assets investments are included within the changes in fair value in the capital account.
Exchange profits and losses on other currency balances are separately credited or charged to the capital account except where they relate to revenue items.
