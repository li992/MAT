2 For the year ending 31 March 2007 the expected rate of return for bonds consisted of a 5.1 per cent rate of return for corporate bonds and a 4.0 per cent rate of return for government bonds.

The long term rate of return on equities and property are derived from considering current risk free rates of return with the addition of an appropriate future risk premium from an analysis of historic returns in various countries.
The long term rates of return on bonds and cash investments are set in line with market yields currently available at the balance sheet date.
