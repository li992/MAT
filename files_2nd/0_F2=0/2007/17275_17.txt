Notes to the Group Accounts Accounting Policies for the Year Ended 3 February 2007 The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
An explanation is provided where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the nearest Saturday to 31 January.
The financial year for 2007 represents the 53 weeks ended 3 February 2007.
The comparative financial year for 2006 was the 52 weeks ended 28 January 2006.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities derivative financial instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed on page 46 as critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty and in note 23.
Standards, Amendments and Interpretations Effective in 2006 but not relevant The following standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 29 January 2006 but they are not relevant to the Groups operations: IAS 21 Amendment, Net investment in a foreign operation: IAS 39 Amendment, Cash flow hedge accounting of forecast intragroup transactions: IAS 39 Amendment, The fair value option: IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Amendment, Financial guarantee contracts: IFRS 1 Amendment, First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards: IFRS 6, Exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources: IFRIC 4, Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease: IFRIC 5, Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds: and IFRIC 6, Liabilities arising from participating in a specific market Waste electrical and electronic equipment.
New Standards and Interpretations of Existing Standards that are not yet Effective and have not been Early Adopted by the Group The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 4 February 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IFRS 7, Financial instruments: Disclosures, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of financial statements Capital disclosures, were not early adopted.
IFRS 7 introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments: IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 May 2006.
IFRIC 8 requires consideration of transactions involving the issuance of equity instruments where the identifiable consideration received is less than the fair value of the equity instruments issued to establish whether or not they fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
The Group will apply IFRIC 8 from 4 February 2007, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups financial statements: IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
IFRIC 10 prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
The Group will apply IFRIC 10 from 4 February 2007 but it is not expected to have any significant impact on the Groups accounts: IFRS 8, Operating segments, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard uses a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes: and IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions, effective from annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities for instance, options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled.
This is not expected to have any impact on the Groups accounts.
Interpretations to Existing Standards that are not yet Effective and not Relevant for the Groups Operations The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 4 February 2007 or later periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations: IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies.
IFRIC 9 Re-assessment of embedded derivatives.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 41 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The Group has used the purchase method of accounting for the acquisition of subsidiaries.
Under the purchase method of accounting the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets acquired, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities are measured initially at their fair values.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of its associates post acquisition profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
Joint Ventures Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities in which the Group has an interest.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
The Group combines its share of the joint ventures individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Groups financial statements.
Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
a Sales of goods Entertainment, Wholesale and Publishing The Group sells a range of entertainment products as a publisher and distributor.
Sales of goods are recognised when a Group entity has delivered a product to a customer and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the acceptance of the products.
Delivery does not occur until the products have been shipped to the specified location, the risks of obsolescence and loss have been transferred to the customer, and the customer has accepted the products.
The entertainment products are often sold with volume discounts and with a right to return products.
Sales are recorded based on the price specified in the sales contracts, net of the estimated volume discounts and returns at the time of sale.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for the discounts and returns.
No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term which is consistent with market practice.
b Sales of goods Retail The Group operates a chain of retail outlets.
Sales of goods are recognised when a Group entity sells or delivers a product to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit card.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the retail customer with a right to return within 28 days.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
The Group does not operate any loyalty programmes.
c Other Revenue arising on the sale of credit vouchers represents third party commission arising on these transactions.
Licensing royalties are recognised as revenue when the following criteria are met: the licence agreement has been executed by all parties: the licence term has commenced: and the collection of royalties is reasonably assured.
All licence royalties received in advance are included within deferred income until the above criteria are met.
Segment Reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
Other Income Other income, including sales commission, is recognised on an accruals basis to match the provision of the related goods or services.
Interest income is recognised on a time-apportioned basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 42 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Foreign Currencies The functional and the presentational currency of the Group is Pounds Sterling.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into Sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied.
The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions : and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Dividend Payment Policy Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, when paid.
Exceptional Items Items that are material in size, unusual and infrequent in nature are presented as exceptional items in the income statement.
The Directors are of the opinion that the separate recording of exceptional items provides helpful information about the Groups underlying business performance.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary or joint venture at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold.
Intangible Assets Brands are stated at cost less amortisation, with amortisation on a straight-line basis over 20 years.
Underlying rights and trade names are stated at fair value at acquisition less amortisation, with amortisation on a straight-line basis over ten years.
Purchased copyrights and licences are stated at cost less amortisation and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the underlying legal agreements, which typically range from three to ten years.
Customer relationships are stated at fair value determined on acquisition and are amortised on a straight-line basis ranging from three to ten years.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Incremental employee costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software is amortised over five years.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment based on the ongoing benefit derived from their use, with provision made where required.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated by the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their useful economic life as follows: Land and buildings Freeholds 2 per cent Long leaseholds 5 per cent Short leaseholds over the life of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment Tenants improvements shorter of ten years and the remaining life of the lease Fixtures and fittings between 5 per cent and 15 per cent Computers and electronic equipment between 20 per cent and 50 per cent Motor cars 25 per cent Commercial vehicles 33 per cent The Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing freehold properties.
During the year ended 3 February 2007 the Group revised the useful economic lives of certain store fixtures and fittings from ten years to 20 years.
During the prior year the Group revised the useful economic lives of certain computers and electronic equipment.
The impact of these changes has been quantified in note 13.
The assets carrying values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Disposal of Land and Buildings Profits and losses on the disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts or where the completion cannot be reasonably withheld.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 43 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Finance Leases Assets funded through finance leases are capitalised as fixed assets and depreciated in accordance with the policy for the class of asset concerned.
The resulting lease obligations are included in creditors net of finance charges.
Interest costs on finance leases are charged to the income statement.
Operating Leases Operating lease payments, including fixed rental uplifts, are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Lease incentives are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Inventories Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-down and shrinkage.
Costs of inventories include the transfer from equity of any gains losses on qualifying cash flow hedges on purchases.
Obsolescence and mark-down provisions against stocks identified as residual to the business are calculated by reference to the tracking of historic recovery rates.
Shrinkage provisions are calculated by reference to the stock loss rates derived from the store and distribution centre stock count programmes.
Rebates Receivable from Suppliers Volume-related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Marketing contributions Marketing contributions receivable from suppliers are credited to the income statement as a reduction to cost for sales in the period in which they are earned.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
This provision represents the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement as a reduction to cost of sales.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits at call with banks, other liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts where these are set-off against cash to the extent these reduce available cash to nil.
Bank overdrafts where there is no right of set-off are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value net of transaction costs incurred.
Provisions Provisions for restructuring costs and legal claims are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, where it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been reliably estimated.
Restructuring provisions comprise the expected costs of the reconfiguration of the out-of-town stores.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Provisions are measured at the present value of managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
Current Taxation The taxation charge for current tax is based on the results for the year, as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Pensions All employees are entitled to join the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS after completion of one years service.
The WGPS is a defined benefit pension scheme.
The Company also facilitates a Stakeholder pension arrangement for employees and makes contributions to a defined contribution pension scheme the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust, which was closed to new entrants in June 2003 and currently has 63 active members.
The Woolworths Group Retirement Trust is in the process of being wound up.
Employees of Total Home Entertainment Distribution Limited participate in the Total Home Entertainment Group Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme.
Employees of Bertram Group Limited participate in the Bertram Group Personal Pension Scheme, a defined contribution scheme.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the WGPS is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised actuarial gains or losses and past service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximate to the terms of the pension liability.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 44 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Pensions continued Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SoRIE in the period in which they arise.
For defined contribution schemes, the Group pays contributions on an agreed basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Share-based Payments The Company no longer grants share options under its Executive Share Option Schemes.
Instead, Share Awards are made to senior management which vest dependent in part on performance targets being met.
A Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees, continues to operate.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share awards options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share awards options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of share awards options that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share awards options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are shown as equity.
Where any Group company purchases the Companys equity share capital the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income tax, is deducted from equity attributable to the Companys equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Companys equity holders.
ESOP The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered Trust.
The assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The purchase or sale of shares in the Trust are accounted for as treasury share transactions and are shown as movements in retained earnings.
Derivative Financial Instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: a firm commitment fair value hedge : or hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods in which the hedged items affect the income statement.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, inventory or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at the time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting.
Such derivatives are classified as at fair value through the income statement, and changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Fair Value Estimation The fair values of short-term deposits, loans, and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to be approximate to their book values.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of credit vouchers in issue is the face value of the instruments potentially redeemable outside the Group, that remain unredeemed and unextinguished at the balance sheet date.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 45 Notes to the Group Accounts continued Financial Risk Management Financial risk factors The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, market interest rates, counterparty credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using foreign currency financial instruments.
In addition other instruments were used during the year to manage the Groups interest rate exposure.
The Board of Directors has approved a Group Treasury Policy that sets out the financial risk management policies applied by the Group.
A central Group Treasury function manages the Groups financial risk in accordance with this policy, receiving regular information including forecast information from all the operating companies in the Group to prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
A procedures manual is maintained that reflects this policy and sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, counterparty credit risk, liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risks against Sterling primarily on transactions in US dollars.
It enters into forward currency contracts to hedge the cash flows of its product sourcing operation ie it buys US dollars forward in exchange for Sterling and looks forward 12 months on a rolling basis at forecasted purchase volumes.
The policy framework requires hedging between 50 per cent and 80 per cent of anticipated import purchases that are denominated in US dollars.
All of the forward contracts entered into by the Group qualified as highly probable purchases for which hedge accounting was used.
b Interest rate risk The Group has a seasonal cash flow that moves between net cash and net debt in the course of each year.
The Group repaid its 97.8 million Senior Note in November 2006.
This Senior Note was issued at fixed rates of interest, with all remaining borrowings excluding finance leases and deposits of cash being at floating rates of interest.
The Group also settled an interest rate swap at the same time as the Senior Note was repaid.
This had been used as a cash flow hedge of future interest payments related to part of the Senior Note principal that had the effect of increasing the proportion of the Groups floating interest rate debt.
Other than a small proportion of finance lease borrowing at fixed interest rates the Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
c Counterparty credit risk The Group has some significant concentrations of credit risk within its business.
Policies have been implemented that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence and on potential suppliers before orders can be raised.
Trade credit insurance is employed as appropriate to protect a proportion of the Groups debtors.
Financial instrument and investment counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board in accordance with Group Treasury policy.
Exposure to counterparties is managed through a framework that limits amounts invested together with amounts contracted through financial instruments according to the counterpartys public credit rating.
d Liquidity risk The Group Treasury function is required to ensure the Group has sufficient committed debt facilities to cover its liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.
During the year, the Group entered into an amendment of its existing committed bank facilities reducing the amount committed to 225 million and revising certain terms.
At the year-end 155 million remained undrawn.
In addition to its committed bank facilities the Group has access to a 40 million facility providing receivables discounting financing through its subsidiary THE Distribution Limited.
Current facilities were sufficient to refinance the 97.8 million Senior Note note 32 in November 2006 and to cover the Groups projected remaining liquidity requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, the committed facilities maturing in 2009.
Critical Accounting Judgements and Estimation Uncertainty Impairment of assets Goodwill is considered for impairment at least annually.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are considered for impairment if there is a reason to believe that an impairment may be necessary.
Factors taken into consideration in reaching such a decision include the economic viability of the asset itself and where it is a component of a larger economic unit, the viability of that unit.
Future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets are projected, taking into account market conditions and the expected useful lives of the assets.
The present value of these cash flows, determined using an appropriate discount rate, is compared to the current net asset value and, if lower, the assets are impaired to the present value.
Pension assumptions Post-retirement defined benefits are provided for certain existing and former employees.
Actuarial valuations are based on assumptions which include employee turnover, mortality rates, the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return of retirement plan assets, healthcare inflation cost and rates of increase in compensation costs.
Full details are contained in note 25.
The main accounting judgement is the real discount rate, ie the excess of the discount rate over inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1 per cent, the pension obligation would decrease increase by approximately 9.7 million before tax and the annual service cost would decrease increase by approximately 0.6 million.
Valuation of intangible assets on acquisition Estimates are used in the course of acquisitions to determine the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.
If any intangible assets are identified, depending on the type of asset and the complexity of determining its fair value the Group either consults with an independent external valuation expert or develops the fair value internally, using an appropriate valuation technique which is generally derived from a forecast of the total expected future net cash flows.
Assets may be valued using methods based on cost, market price or net present value, depending on the type of asset and the availability of information.
Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 46 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 1.
Segmental Analysis The Group considers that business segmental analysis is its primary reporting basis.
The Groups business is divided into a Retail segment and an Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing segment.
Woolworths plc, WMS Jersey Limited and Flogistics Limited are included within the Retail segment, with Entertainment UK Limited, THE Distribution Limited THE, Bertram Group Limited Bertram, Disc Distribution Limited and 2entertain Limited being the constituents of Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing.
MVC Entertainment Limited was disposed of on 30 July 2005 and was shown as a discontinued operation in the year ending 28 January 2006.
No material trading is undertaken outside the UK and consequently no geographic segmentation has been shown.

This reduces the anticipated cost of meeting the pension schemes ongoing obligations.
Previously, no benefit had been taken in the actuarial estimates for commutation.
The evidence, however, is that most people do commute as much of their pension as possible and therefore the underlying assumptions have been changed to make a prudent estimate of the likely level of commutation.
Discontinued operations in the prior year relate to the conclusion of the sale of MVC Entertainment Limited to a group of retail investors on 30 July 2005 for a cash consideration of 5.5 million.
The pre-tax exceptional item relating to this discontinued operation was 28.3 million, which consisted of a 25.6 million loss on disposal of the business after deducting the 5.5 million proceeds, and providing for stock losses and 2.7 million of costs associated with the closure of a number of MVC stores before completion of the disposal.

Discontinued Operations continued On 30 July 2005, the Group sold MVC Entertainment Limited MVC, a wholly owned subsidiary to a group of retail investors for 5.5 million in cash.
The cash was paid following completion.
In addition there was a 2.6 million cash outflow from the exceptional store closure programme undertaken prior to this sale, and a further cash outflow of 2.2 million from disposal costs.
The store closure programme and the subsequent sale of MVC created an exceptional loss after taxation of 26.0 million.
On disposal of MVC an agreement was entered into with the acquirer to transfer to Woolworths Group a share of the benefit of tax losses for the year ended 28 January 2006 based on the relevant period of ownership of the company.
Based on the information provided from the administrators of MVC, the Group has recognised the potential benefit of 1.5 million in the current year in respect of further losses to be transferred.

Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Group Accounts 51 Notes to the Group Accounts continued 10.
Earnings per Share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares including shares held by a trust which are accounted for as treasury shares note 29.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential shares share options.
For the share options, a calculation is undertaken to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated is then compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options to arrive at the number of dilutive shares.
Adjusted Adjusted earnings per share excludes the effect of exceptional items, the amortisation of certain intangible assets and the fixed rental uplift adjustment.
An IFRIC pronouncement in September 2005 required the total minimum payments across the entire lease term to be recognised on a straight-line basis across the life of the lease.

No impairment charges have been made.
During the year, the Group acquired goodwill in respect of the THE and Bertram acquisitions.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of THE has been tested for impairment and in the opinion of the Directors no adjustment is necessary.
This calculation was based on the five-year projected cash flows of the underlying business approved by management and included Entertainment UK Limited as part of the cash generating unit.
These cash flows have been discounted using an applicable post-taxation rate of return of 7.50 per cent.
The Directors are of the opinion that there is no impairment of goodwill in respect of the Bertram acquisition as the fair value equals the purchase consideration given the proximity of the acquisition to the year end.

Borrowings continued As part of the interest rate management strategy, the Company entered into an interest rate swap for a notional principal amount of 30 million that matured in November 2006.
Under this swap, the Company received interest on a fixed basis at a rate of 8.75 per cent per annum and paid interest on a variable basis.
Finance leases are held at fixed rates of interest.

Provisions continued Restructuring The 27.7 million provision remaining at 3 February 2007 has been set up to recognise the expected costs of the reconfiguration of the out-of-town stores and the majority of this is expected to crystallise within the next three years.
Insurance This includes self-insurance provisions, which represent the aggregate of outstanding claims plus a projection of losses incurred but not reported.
Self-insurance provisions are expected to be utilised over a two to three year period.
Guarantees arising on joint venture A provision of 5.2 million has been recognised in respect of additional capital contributions for shares issued by 2entertain Limited on formation of the joint venture, relating to the guaranteed value of the business transferred to 2entertain Limited.
The potential liability will be finalised during 2007 08 after the guarantee period ends in September 2007.
Onerous property contracts Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Group has provided against future liabilities for all long-term idle properties and properties sublet at a shortfall.
The provision is based on the discounted value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges based on the remaining period of the leases, which at 3 February 2007 range between one and 11 years.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 30 per cent 2006: 30 per cent.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The movement on the deferred tax account is as shown below: 3 February 28 January 2007 2006 Note m m At 29 January 2006 22.8 9.4 Deferred tax asset on adoption of IAS 32 and 39 1.7 Income statement charge credit 1.0 3.2 Tax charged credited to equity 8 11.9 8.5 Acquisition of subsidiary 33 8.9 At 3 February 2007 1.0 22.8 Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of temporary differences, where it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows: Property Financial Pensions leases instruments Other Total Deferred tax assets m m m m m At 29 January 2006 39.3 24.7 1.3 3.4 68.7 Charged credited to the income statement 2.2 3.3 0.9 0.5 2.5 Charged to equity 11.9 11.9 At 3 February 2007 25.2 28.0 2.2 3.9 59.3 Accelerated Trade name Computer Revaluation Customer tax Underlying Rolled over and brand software of property relationships depreciation rights gains Total Deferred tax liabilities m m m m m m m m At 29 January 2006 22.4 7.8 15.7 45.9 Arising on acquisition of subsidiary note 33 1.5 0.2 0.3 6.9 8.9 Credited charged to the income statement 0.3 0.7 0.9 5.4 3.5 At 3 February 2007 1.5 0.2 0.3 6.6 21.7 6.9 21.1 58.3 Included within deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are amounts of 58.9 million 2006: 68.7 million and 53.5 million 2006: 45.0 million respectively, for amounts expected to reverse after more than one year.
Bertram had losses brought forward at the time of acquisition by the Group which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset, as recoverability is considered uncertain.
At 3 February 2007 this asset amounts to 3.2 million.

Deferred Tax continued The deferred tax credited to equity during the year is as follows: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 February 28 January 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax charge on share-based payments 0.1 0.2 Deferred tax charge credit on pension scheme actuarial losses 11.9 9.3 Deferred tax credit charge on movement in derivatives 0.1 0.6 11.9 8.5 The Chancellors Budget Statement of 21 March 2007 announced the reduction in the rate of Corporation Tax from 30 per cent to 28 per cent with effect from 1 April 2008.
It is estimated that this change will reduce the future benefit of the deferred tax asset by 0.1 million.
Retirement Benefit Obligations A number of pension schemes operate within the Group.
These are the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme a defined benefit scheme, the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust a defined contribution scheme and the Legal & General Stakeholder Plan for Woolworths Group employees.
Colleagues who joined after 3 June 2003 are no longer eligible to join the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust, although existing membership is allowed to continue at present.
The pension costs for the defined contribution scheme are as follows: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 February 28 January 2007 2006 m m Defined contribution schemes 0.3 0.3 The most recent valuation of the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme was performed by Hewitt Associates as at 3 February 2007.
The principal assumptions made are: 53 weeks to 52 weeks to 3 February 28 January 2007 2006 % per annum% per annum Discount rate 5.5 4.9 Expected return on plan assets 7.7 7.7 Future salary increases 3.5 3.3 Future pension increases Pre April 2006 service 2.9 2.7 Post April 2006 service 2.3 2.1 Inflation assumption 2.9 2.7 The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, ie the excess of the discount rate over inflation.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy for members have changed since the last accounting disclosures were produced.
The mortality tables adopted for this year are PM FA92C2017 for current pensioners and PM FA92C2027 for future pensioners.
Further allowances for improving longevity are included, in the form of short cohort mortality improvements: the assumed average age at death for a current 60-year-old pensioner is 85.6 for a male previously 83.8 and 88.5 for a female previously 86.0 : the assumed average age at death for current active and deferred members when they reach age 60 is 86.4 for a male previously 83.8 and 89.2 for a female previously 86.0.
An allowance has been made for commutation members taking tax-free cash rather than pension at retirement.
This has been allowed for in the following way: the effect of introducing an allowance for commutation at pre 6 April 2006 levels has been incorporated on to the balance sheet via the SoRIE.
For this purpose, we have assumed that 15 per cent of the retirement pension is converted to lump sum with the remaining 85 per cent taken as pension: and the effect of allowing for the increased commutation lump sums after 6 April 2006 has been incorporated on to the balance sheet via the income statement note 6.
For this purpose, we have assumed that the amount of retirement pension taken as lump sum increases to 25 per cent with the remaining 75 per cent taken as pension.
The majority of scheme assets are invested in equities with an expected rate of return of 8.5 per cent per annum 2006: 8.25 per cent per annum.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.

Of the total charge, 13.4 million 2006: 14.1 million is included in selling, marketing and administrative expenses, with 1.3 million credit 2006: 2.4 million charge included in interest payable and similar charges.
The past service credit of 8.7 million reflects the effect of the A-day reforms to pensions in relation to the increased amount of future pension which can be commuted into a lump sum on retirement.

Share options Under the Executive Share Option Schemes, participants were granted options on a half-yearly basis depending on their position in the Group.
The option exercise price was the market price at the time of the grant.
Subject to the attainment of performance targets, options are capable of exercise after at least three years and within ten years of the date of grant.
For options granted after September 2001, the performance target is growth in Earnings per Share EPS as defined in the relevant scheme rules.
For full vesting, EPS must increase by a minimum of 6 per cent per annum in addition to the increase in the Retail Prices Index.
There is a facility for one retest at the fourth anniversary of grant.
No further options have been granted since 25 March 2004.
Under the ShareSave Plan, eligible UK employees can enter into an Inland Revenue approved savings contract for a period of three years whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option exercise price is the average market price over three days shortly before an offer is made.
No discount has been applied and the options are exercisable within a six-month period from the date the savings contract matures.
The rules of the Executive Share Option Schemes and ShareSave Plan include provision for the early exercise of options in certain circumstances.
