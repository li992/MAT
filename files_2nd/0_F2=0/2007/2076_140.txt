36 Acquired operations On 1 February 2007, the BHP Billiton Group acquired a 44 per cent interest in the operation of the Genghis Khan oil and gas development Genghis Khan for a total cash consideration of US$583 million.
Genghis Khan includes Green Canyon Blocks 652 and 608 and was discovered in 2005 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Genghis Khan is located in the same geological structure and allows the Group to benefit from development synergies with the Shenzi project, which was sanctioned for development in the 2006 financial year.
Genghis Khan was acquired in the Petroleum segment.

Pro-forma financial information The pro-forma consolidated results of operations of the BHP Billiton Group for the year ended 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 would remain unchanged assuming that the acquisition of Genghis Khan occurred as of 1 July of each year as the operation did not generate revenue or incur operating costs.
