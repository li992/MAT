Impairment discontinued operations A 2.0m impairment loss was incurred during the period.
As part of its business review, management identified the impairment losses of 2.0m relating to the closure of the Trafford Park Bakery.
The impaired assets have been sold during the period as part of the sale of the Assets therefore the impairment has been included within discontinued operations.
The impairment losses identified represent the difference between the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and their recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations unless management is committed to closing or selling the business.
If the value of the business is to be recovered through sale or closure then the recoverable amount is the fair value less costs to sell.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using the groups weighted average cost of capital.
The company prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial plans approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates these cash flows in perpetuity using growth assumptions relevant for the business sector.
The growth rate does not exceed 3.0% 2005 06: does not exceed 3.0% and is not considered to be higher than the average long term industry growth rate.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is the groups post tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.0% 2005 06: 7.0%.
This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount rate to pre-tax cash flows.
