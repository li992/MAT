"Foseco plc Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued 18 Long term incentive plan 2007 2006 m m Ltip cost - normal 1.1 0.8 Ltip cost - exceptional 1.4 - Less: cost recovered from subsidiary companies 2.2 0.8 0.3 - In the light of the the proposed acquisition of the Group by Cookson Group plc, the Remuneration Committee amended the vesting conditions attached to the long term incentive plan ""Ltip"" such that all awards would vest in full, contingent upon the successful completion of the acquisition, to eligible employees still employed at the completion date."
The profit and loss account expense for the year has been split between those charges which would have arisen in the absence of the proposed takeover and have been charged to operating profit before exceptional items, and those which have arisen from the change in the vesting conditions and the shortened vesting period and have been charged to exceptional items.
The charge to operating profit before exceptional items has been determined on the following basis, which is consistent with previous periods.
Eligible employees or directors were awarded a number of ordinary shares in Foseco plc which was to be determined by reference to the Group's performance over three financial years.
These share awards were to vest three years after the date on which they were granted, and were to be settled by distribution of shares.
Shares could vest only if the Group met two performance conditions.
"The Group's Total Shareholder Return ""TSR"" had to at least match the median TSR of the FTSE All-share index excluding investment companies over the vesting period, and the Group had to pass a threshold level of cumulative cash flow per share over three financial years."
If the conditions were met, the actual number of shares to vest was to be determined by reference to the cash flow per share performance, up to a pre-defined maximum.
At 31 December 2007 the maximum number of shares which could vest as a result of the 2007 award was 1,190,571 2006: award: 1,289,926, 2005 award: 1,803,592.
The income statement expense for the share awards was been estimated by applying fair values per share of 1.25p for the 2007 award, 1.18p for the 2006 award and 0.67p for the 2005 award, as calculated by an independent valuer, to the number of shares which the directors believed were likely to vest, based on current forecasts of the cumulative cash flow per share.
As continuous employment by the Group over the three year vesting period was a pre-condition of eligibility to receive the shares, allowance had been made for the possibility that some employees might not meet that condition.
"The fair value per share of the award was determined using principles similar to a ""Monte Carlo simulation"", taking into account share price volatility, correlation with a comparator group, and the plan's vesting schedule."
Reinvestment of dividends is not incorporated into the valuation.
