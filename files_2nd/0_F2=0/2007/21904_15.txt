Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, revised December 2005, for investment trusts, issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP directs that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2007 would have been 1,012,000 2006: 640,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a purchase date basis.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Realised gains and losses on the disposal of investments are taken to Capital Reserve realised, and unrealised gains and losses on the revaluation of investments are taken to Capital Reserve unrealised, as explained in note 1 c below.
c Capital reserves Capital Reserve realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: realised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised gains and losses on transactions undertaken to hedge exposures of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation: and special dividends of a capital nature.
Capital Reserve unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an effective yield basis.
Other investment income and deposit interest are shown on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
32 British Assets Trust plc e Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is recognised at the standard rate of corporation tax without discounting.
The Company had no deferred tax liabilities at the year end.
f Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees, which derive predominantly by virtue of the Companys capital performance, are charged 100 per cent to capital.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
g Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital, in accordance with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
h Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserves or the Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

On 26 February 2007 the investment management agreement was novated to F&C Investment Business Limited FCIB, a wholly owned subsidiary of F&C.
FCIB receives a basic quarterly fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.075 per cent of the value of Companys total assets less current liabilities.
The agreement also provides for a performance-related fee calculated on an annual basis by reference to the performance of the Company against the benchmark index over each 12 month period ended on 30 September.
The performance-related fee is payable in arrears at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent per annum of the value of equity shareholders funds.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year prorated to the date of termination.
Basic investment management fees have been allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
Performance fees are charged 100 per cent to capital.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings can be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
Non-current asset investments held see note 9 are valued at bid prices which equate to their fair values.
The market value of the Companys Bonds is disclosed in note 20.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the balance sheet.
Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as allowed by FRS 25, other than for currency disclosures.
19 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Investment and portfolio performance are discussed in more detail in the Managers Review.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 14 and 15.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific currency risk, or gain an exposure to a specific market.
As at the year end the Company had no exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed in note 21.
40 British Assets Trust plc 20 Interest rate, liquidity and credit risk Floating rate Cash is held in floating rate deposit accounts.
The Company seeks to receive interest payments on cash balances at suitable commercial rates for the relevant currency for each deposit.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.

As they are fixed rate bonds, the Company is exposed to changes in market value in the event that the bonds are repaid before maturity.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in fixed interest securities.
The fair value of the Bonds, based on middle market prices, at 30 September 2007 was 126.3 million 2006: 132.9 million.
Liquidity risk In respect of liquidity risk, the Companys assets comprise realisable securities.
The Company holds cash and has overdraft facilities to meet short term obligations.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment which it has entered into with the Company.
The Managers have a monitoring procedure whereby counterparty risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 526,663,000 as at 30 September 2007 2006: 534,576,000.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 21 Foreign currency risk The Company invests in overseas securities and holds foreign currency cash balances which give rise to currency risks.
In the year to 30 September 2007, the Company entered into US Dollar and Euro foreign currency contracts with a view to hedging these currency risks.

22 Contingent Asset The Association of Investment Companies and JPMorgan Claverhouse Investment Trust plc lodged a joint appeal in 2004 for the payment of management fees by investment trusts to be treated as exempt from VAT.
In June 2007 the European Court of Justice ECJ found in favour of the appellants, declaring that investment trusts should be treated as special investment funds and thus exempted from VAT on management fees.
HM Revenue & Customs HMRC has recently announced that it will not appeal against the ECJ decision.
The Managers have submitted protective claims to HMRC in respect of all prior periods which might fall within the scope of the ECJ ruling and in which VAT was collected from the Company by the Managers.
However, although the Company expects to recover VAT on management fees paid to the Managers, at this point in time the amount is so uncertain that it has not been recognised as an asset in the accounts.
