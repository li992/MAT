The group presents its consolidated financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The company therefore hedges a substantial portion of the groups exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding loans in foreign currencies.
Translation adjustments arising on the translation of foreign currency loans are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts so as to hedge group translation risk not hedged by way of loans.
Gains and losses on such forward foreign exchange contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account.
The notional value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2007 was 373.2m 2006: 342.4m.
All these contracts had matured by 29 February 2008, at which point they were replaced with new forward foreign exchange contracts.
Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps Borrowing at floating rates as described in note e exposes the company to cash flow interest rate risk, which the company manages within policy limits approved by the directors.
Interest rate swaps and, to a limited extent, forward rate agreements are utilised to fix the interest rate on a proportion of borrowings on a reducing scale over forward periods up to a maximum period of five years.
At 31 December 2007 the nominal value of such contracts was 213.5m in respect of US dollar 2006: 196.7m and 183.6m in respect of euro 2006: 141.5m, their weighted average interest rate was 4.9% US dollar 2006: 4.9% and 3.8% euro 2006: 3.4%, and their weighted average period to maturity was three years.
All the interest rate hedging instruments are designated and fully effective as cash flow hedges and movements in their fair value have been deferred in equity.
The US Private Placement market is predominantly a fixed rate market, with investors looking for a fixed rate return over the life of the loan notes.
At the time of issue in March 2007, the company was comfortable with the proportion of floating rate exposure not hedged by interest rate swaps and therefore rather than take on a higher proportion of fixed rate debt arranged fixed to floating swaps effectively converting the fixed coupon on the Private Placement to a floating rate.
Following the swaps the resulting average coupon on the US Private Placement is Libor 60bps.
These swaps have been documented as fair value hedges of the US Private Placement fixed interest loan notes, with the movements in their fair value posted to profit and loss at the same time as the movement in the fair value of the hedged item.
