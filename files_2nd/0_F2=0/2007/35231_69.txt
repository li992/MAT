National insurance is payable on gains made by employees on the exercise of share-based payments granted to them.
The eventual liability to national insurance is dependent on: the market price of the companys shares at the date of exercise: the number of equity instruments that will be exercised: and the prevailing rate of national insurance at the date of exercise.
A provision is made for the potential liability for cash-settled share options based on the valuation carried out at each balance sheet date see note 15.
