22 NOTES CONTINUED Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2007 13 Risk management and financial instruments Capital management The Groups policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Group monitors the return on capital as well as the level of total shareholders equity and the amount of dividends paid to ordinary shareholders.
The Group funds its operations through a mixture of shareholders equity and bank and capital market borrowings.
All of the borrowings are managed by a central treasury function and funds raised are lent onward to operating subsidiaries as required.
The overall objective is to manage the funding to ensure the Group has a portfolio of competitively priced borrowing facilities to meet the demands of the business over time and, in order to do so, arranges a mixture of borrowings through different sources with a variety of maturity dates.
The Groups businesses provide a high and consistent level of cash generation, which helps fund future development and growth, while the Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
From time to time the Group purchases its own shares on the market.
The timing and amount of these purchases depends on the prevailing market conditions, the price of the Companys ordinary shares and the level of the Groups net debt.
Any shares purchased are either cancelled or held as treasury shares.
This is consistent with the Boards strategic priority of growing the Group both organically and by acquisition and its objective of operating with an appropriate balance sheet structure.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year and the Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
Treasury policies and controls The Group has a centralised treasury department to control external borrowings and manage liquidity, interest rate and foreign currency risks.
Treasury policies are approved by the Board and cover the nature of the exposure to be hedged, the types of financial instruments that may be employed and the criteria for investing and borrowing cash.
There have been no changes to the treasury policies and controls during the year.
The Group uses derivatives to manage its foreign currency and interest rate risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
The treasury department is subject to periodic independent review by the internal audit department.
Underlying policy assumptions and activities are reviewed by the executive directors.
Controls over exposure changes and transaction authenticity are in place and dealings are restricted to those banks with the relevant combination of geographic presence and suitable credit rating.
The Group continually monitors the credit ratings of its counterparties and the credit exposure to each counterparty.
The Group designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : b a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates cash flow hedge : or c a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is set out in the financial instruments accounting policy in Note 2.
The Group tests effectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms and regression analysis.
Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 23 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
The Group is funded by multi-currency credit facilities from the Groups bankers and US dollar bonds.
The bank facilities have tenures ranging from one to seven years and mature between 2008 and 2013.
At 31 December 2007 the available bank facilities totalled 655.0m of which 439.3m was drawn down.
In addition the Group maintains overdraft and uncommitted facilities to provide short term flexibility.
At 31 December 2007 the total US dollar bonds outstanding were $535m with maturities ranging from 2008 to 2018.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December is set out below.
The amounts disclosed below are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and therefore include interest cash flows forecast using LIBOR interest rates at 31 December.
Derivative financial instruments of 11.3m 2006: 4.8m have been included within the tables since they predominantly relate to derivatives which are used to manage the interest cash flows on the Groups debt.

Accordingly they have been aged based on the maturity dates of the underlying facilities.
At 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 there were no loans secured by either fixed or floating charges on the Groups assets.
24 NOTES CONTINUED Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2007 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued The Group had available undrawn committed facilities at 31 December as follows: 2007 2006 m m Expiring within one year 15.7 21.0 Expiring after one year but within two years 16.2 Expiring after two years 200.0 452.3 215.7 489.5 Interest rate risk The Groups strategy is to ensure with a reasonable amount of certainty that the overall Group interest charge is protected against material adverse movements in interest rates.
The US dollar bonds have been swapped to floating rates using interest rate swaps.
Bank loans are drawn for various periods at interest rates linked to LIBOR.
Interest rate caps and interest rate collars are in place to reduce the Groups floating rate exposure to movements in LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps have a fair value hedge relationship with the US dollar bonds.
All fair value hedges were effective during the year and have therefore had no net impact on the income statement as the changes in the hedged item and the hedging instrument are both taken to the income statement.
The intrinsic value of the interest rate collars achieve cash flow hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting is not applied to the interest rate caps or to the time value of the interest rate collars.
With respect to the hedges of the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates, the recognition of interest on the borrowings and the related collar will affect the income statement at each period end date until the borrowings mature in 2010.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 all collar cash flow hedges were effective with a loss of 1.3m 2006: nil recognised in equity.
This will affect the income statement between 2008 and 2010.
The interest rate swaps had a notional principal of 268.8m outstanding at 31 December 2007 2006: 247.4m.
The floating interest rate is based on US dollar LIBOR repricing every three months.
Financial liabilities with a notional principal of 193.0m were capped at 31 December 2007 2006: 156.5m.
The interest rate is based on US dollar and euro LIBOR repricing every three months.
The interest rate collars have been entered into to manage the interest rate risk on US dollar borrowings with a notional principal of 50.3m in 2008 and 150.8m in 2009 and 2010.
Sensitivity to interest rate risk The Groups profit is not sensitive to changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps and the intrinsic values of the interest rate collars since these achieve hedge accounting.
However equity is sensitive to changes in the intrinsic value of the interest rate collars since these are in a cash flow hedge relationship and gains or losses on them are credited or charged to equity.
Fair value movements on interest rate caps and the time value of interest rate collars impact both profit and equity since hedge accounting is not applied to them.
A change of 1% in the interest rate forward curves at 31 December would have the effect set out below as a result of changes in the fair values of derivatives at that date: Impact on profit before tax Impact on equity 1% 1% 1% 1% m m m m 2007 1.0 0.2 2.4 1.8 2006 1.2 0.1 1.2 0.1 Bunzl plc Directors Report and Accounts 2007 NOTES CONTINUED 25 13 Risk management and financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups net assets are in currencies other than sterling.
The Groups policy is to limit the translation exposure and resulting impact on equity by borrowing and or using forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the translation exposure in those currencies in which the Group has significant net assets.
At 31 December 2007 there were no material currency exposures after accounting for the effect of the hedging transactions.
Throughout the year ended 31 December 2007 the Groups borrowings were primarily held in sterling and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge the impact of exchange rate movements arising on consolidation on the translation of the income statement from the respective functional currencies into sterling.
The majority of the Groups transactions are carried out in the respective functional currencies of the Groups operations and so transaction exposures are limited.
However where they do occur the Groups policy is to hedge significant exposures of firm commitments for a period of up to one year as soon as they are committed using forward foreign exchange contracts and these are designated as a cash flow hedge.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 all foreign exchange cash flow hedges were effective with a 0.2m gain recognised in equity.
This will affect the income statement in the year ending 31 December 2008.
A 10% strengthening or weakening of sterling at 31 December would have increased decreased profit before tax and equity for the year by the amounts shown below as a result of translation exposure.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.

Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of loss in relation to a financial asset due to non-payment by the counterparty.
The Groups objective is to reduce its exposure to counterparty default by restricting the type of counterparty it deals with and by employing an appropriate policy in relation to the collection of financial assets.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, derivative financial instruments and receivables which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The credit risk in relation to cash and derivative financial instruments is limited because the Group restricts its dealings to counterparties with high credit ratings.
The credit risk policy specifies the maximum permitted exposure to each counterparty.
For receivables, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
See Note 11 for the analyses of trade and other receivables and the provision for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivables.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables and other financial assets is represented by their carrying amount.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
