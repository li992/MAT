Retirement benefit obligations At 31 December 2007 the group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution, which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2007.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited, participate in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
Total pension cost The total pension cost for the group was 44.1 million 2006: 39.7 million.
The pension costs in respect of the groups defined contribution schemes was 25.8 million 2006: 19.5 million.
Defined benefit plans The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under IAS19 as the group has no rights or obligations in respect of sections of this scheme following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited and XC Trains Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the IAS19 liabilities of the retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to 31 December 2007 by qualified independent actuaries.
The schemes assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2007.
The principal actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date are: 2007 2006 % % Discount rate 5.9 5.2 Inflation rate 3.2 2.9 Increases to deferred benefits during deferment 3.2 2.9 Increases to pensions in payment 3.0 2.9 Increases to salaries 4.2 4.1 Weighted average expected long-term rate of return of the scheme assets at 31 December, after deduction for scheme expenses 7.6 7.5 Weighted average life expectancy for mortality tables to determine benefit obligations: 2007 2006 years years Member age 65 current life expectancy Male 18 19 Female 21 22 Member age 45 life expectancy at age 65 Male 19 20 Female 22 22 85 Notes to the Accounts continued 21.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The major categories of plan assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date for each category, is as follows: 2007 2006 % % Category of assets at the year end Equities 8.25 8.25 Bonds 5.0 4.8 Other 6.9 6.5 Weighted average expected long-term rate of return at 31 December, after deduction for scheme expenses 7.6 7.5 The overall expected rate of return is a weighted average of the expected returns of the various categories of plan assets held.
The directors assessment of the expected returns is based on historical return trends, the forward looking views of financial markets suggested by the yields available and the views of investment organisations.
The actual return on plan assets was 51.2 million 2006: 80.3 million.
