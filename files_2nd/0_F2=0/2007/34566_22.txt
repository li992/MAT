Notes to the accounts For the year ended 30 December 2007 1 significant accounting policies General information Capital & Regional plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered ofce is given on page 88.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 2 and in the operating and financial review on pages 2 to 25.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the accounting policies set out below.
Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: Amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 3 Business Combinations IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating segments Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Amendments to IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Amendments to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Agreements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding requirements and their interaction The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosure requirements when IFRS 7 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulations.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Group's accounting policies, described below, management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Critical accounting judgements include the estimation of performance fees, tax assets and liabilities, fair values of investment properties and derivative financial instruments, the assessment of estimated useful lives and residual values of property and the vesting assumptions relating to management incentive schemes.
Management believes that the estimates and associated assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are reasonable.
However, actual outcomes may differ from those anticipated.
The Group's critical judgements and their effect on the financial statements in relation to performance fees are described in note 5, the narrative in the financial review on page 23 and in note 36, contingent liabilities.
Management has considered in detail and made judgements on the possible further adverse yield shift that is likely to occur over the next two years in connection with shopping centres, retail parks and the leisure market, based on a wide range of available market information.
The net impact of these judgements after the benefit the Group receives as an investor and the adjustment to management incentives has been estimated at a loss of 27million or reduction in net asset value of 38p per share.
Note 36 shows that this loss could potentially increase by a further 6.7 million or 9.5p per share if certain outcomes prevail.
Management has reviewed the non-market based vesting assumptions in relation to the LTIP.
Given the Group's performance over the last three years and the Group's estimated performance over the next two years, management has concluded that no shares will vest under the non-market conditions for 2006 and 2007.
The effect of this is a credit to the income statement of 0.5 million.
Management has relied upon the work undertaken at 30 December 2007 by independent professional qualied valuers, as disclosed in note 13b, in assessing the fair value of the Group's investment and owner occupied properties.
Management has relied upon the work undertaken at 30 December 2007 by independent third party experts in assessing the fair value of the Group's derivative financial instruments.
44 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2007 1 Significant accounting policies continued Management has assessed changes in recent legislation, case law and accounting standards, along with future projections for the Group, in determining the Group's current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and credit to the income statement.
Details are described in note 10 to the accounts.
The judgements, estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The reporting period for subsidiaries ends on 31 December and the financial statements of subsidiaries are consolidated from this date.
Joint ventures and associates In accordance with IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, associates and joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method, whereby the consolidated balance sheet and income statement incorporate the Groups share of the net assets and profit after tax.
The profits include revaluation movements on investment properties.
The reporting period for joint ventures and associates ends on 31 December and the financial statements of joint ventures and associates are consolidated from this date.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the period.
significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.365 2006: 1 1.484.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.462 2006: 1 1.467.
Plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible xed assets, other than investment properties and land, over their expected useful lives: Fixtures and ttings over three to five years, on a straight-line basis.
Motor vehicles over four years, on a straight line-basis.
Property portfolio Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value, being the market value determined by professionally qualied external values, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement.
In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of properties.
Leasehold properties Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classied as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
Capital & Regional Annual Report 2007 45 Notes to the accounts continued For the year ended 30 December 2007 1 Significant accounting policies continued Owner-occupied long leasehold properties Owner-occupied long leasehold properties are included in the financial statements stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
The cost of owner-occupied property is depreciated through the income statement over the period to the end of the lease on a straight-line basis having due regard to its estimated residual value.
Properties under development Attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development are capitalised.
Interest is capitalised gross in the associates and joint ventures before deduction of related deferred tax relief.
There is no interest capitalised in the Group.
Interest is calculated on the development expenditure by reference to specic borrowings where relevant.
A property ceases to be treated as being under development when substantially all activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Refurbishment expenditure Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is expensed as incurred.
Property transactions Acquisitions and disposals are accounted for at the date of legal completion.
Properties are transferred between categories at the estimated market value on the transfer date.
Current property assets Properties held with the intention of disposal are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Head leases Where an investment property is held under a head lease, the head lease is initially recognised as an asset at the sum of the present value of the minimum lease ground rent payable.
The corresponding rent liability to the leaseholder is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Tenant leases and incentives Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for all properties leased to tenants and have determined that all such leases are operating leases.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over a straight-line basis over the term of lease.
Borrowings and derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are held at amortised cost.
They are recognised initially at fair value, after taking into account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, such discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Convertible unsecured loan stock CULS CULS are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of the issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt at the time of the issue of the CULS to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying value of the CULS.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting As dened by IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, derivatives are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash ows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash ow hedge of a rm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement in finance cost line as they arise.
Minority interest The minority interest, arising from the Group's German operations, is classied as a liability and held at fair value in the balance sheet.
Under the terms of the contract the minority has a put option to sell their share back to the Group typically after five years from acquisition.
The minority interests' share of income and expenses is treated as a non-recurring finance charge in the income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
46 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2007 1 Significant accounting policies continued Tax Tax is included in the Group income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is based on the taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are never taxable or tax deductible permanent differences or will be taxable at a later date temporary differences.
Temporary differences principally arise from using different balance sheet values for assets and liabilities from their respective tax base values.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on these temporary differences with the exception of: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying temporary differences can be deducted.
Operating leases Annual rentals under operating leases are charged to profit or loss as incurred.
Employee benets Pension costs Pension liabilities, all of which relate to dened contribution schemes, are charged to the income statement as incurred.
"Long-term incentive plan LTIP The Group has applied the arrangements of IFRS 2 ""Share-based Payments""."
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value of share-based employee remuneration is calculated using a normal distribution model, which the directors consider not to be materially different from the binominal model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Own shares Own shares held by the Group and shown as a deduction from shareholders funds, and included in other reserves.
The cost of own shares is transferred from the own shares held reserve to the retained earnings reserve systematically over the LTIP performance period.
The shares are held in an Employee Share Ownership Trust.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost and discounted to reect the time value of money.
Revenue Performance fees Performance fees are recognised, in line with the property management contracts, at the end of the performance period to which they relate.
The performance period is normally three years.
CRPM earns performance fees for The Mall and Junction Funds on the outperformance relative to the greater of 12% and the appropriate IPD index.
For The X-Leisure Fund the benchmark is only 12%.
Where performance falls short of these benchmarks, fees are repayable, up to the amount received for the previous two years.
Where there is a reasonable likelihood that part of a performance fee will be repaid the estimated repayment will not be recognised as income until the outcome can be reliably estimated.
This policy has been claried as a result of the expected clawback of performance fees.
Management fees Management fees are recognised, in line with the property management contracts, in the period to which they relate.
Management fees include income in relation to services provided by CRPM to both the joint ventures and the associated Funds for asset management, rent reviews, lettings, project co-ordination, procurement, service charges and directly recoverable expenditure.
Net rental income Net rental income is equal to gross rental income, recognised in the period to which it relates, including tenant incentives, less property expenses directly related to letting and holding the properties.
Interest and dividend income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders right to receive payment have been established.
Inter segment transactions All transactions between segments are accounted for on an arms length basis.

The tax losses have not been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
With effect from 1 April 2008 the mainstream corporation tax rate was reduced from 30% to 28%.
The German Government has reduced the corporate income tax rate from 26.375% to 15.875%, effective from 1 January 2008.
Consequently, the rate at which deferred tax is provided on UK deferred tax items is now 28% and the rate applied to German deferred tax items is 15.825%.
The effect of these rate adjustments is a reduction in the total deferred tax liability brought forward at 31 December 2006 of 3.2 million.
This amount is shown as a deferred tax prior year adjustment in the income statement.
The calculation of the Groups tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be nally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authorities.
In such cases, the Group has reserved on the basis that these provisions are required.
If all such issues are resolved in the Groups favour, provisions of up to 17.7 million could be released in future periods.
A significant part of the Groups property interests is held offshore.
The Group has also undertaken a restructuring of its activities to separate legally its income and earnings businesses, in line with its business model.
The Group has been advised that no capital gains tax liability arises on these transactions and that certain tax deductions and losses will be available following the restructuring, although the relevant computations have yet to be agreed.

This goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
Impairment is tested by discounting the expected cash ows generated by the leisure division of CRPM over the life of the property management contract, which is coterminous with the life of the X-Leisure Fund.
The expected life of the property management contract assumes that the life of the X-Leisure Fund is extended to 31 December 2023.
The rate used to discount the expected cash ows is 8.5% which is considered to be the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
Management fees receivable, as well as both xed and variable administration costs, are assumed to grow by 2% per annum.
No account is taken of any future performance fees apart from where there is an expectation of performance fees being repaid in the next two years.

2 Since the date of sale in 2004 of its interest in Glasgow Fort the Group has received a total of 8.4 million further profits from its remaining interest in the joint venture.
Further profits are potentially receivable and are largely dependent upon planning consent being obtained for future phases of the development and the letting of units at above target rents.
We have also given certain rental guarantees for a five year period and have made provision for the amounts which we expect to pay in respect of these.
We have estimated our share of the fair value of the right to receive these future profits at 30 December 2007 at 0.2 million.
The value reflects our assessment of the considerable uncertainty surrounding the receipt of further amounts and the fact that there is no ready market for such assets.
In accordance with current accounting standards we have recognised this right as a financial asset in our 30 December 2007 balance sheet.
In prior years we have disclosed the right as a contingent asset.
We estimate that the value of the asset at 30 December 2006 would have been 1.2 million.
The effect of this accounting change in our 2007 financial statements is not considered material to our prior year results.
3 The Braehead centre was opened in April 2006 but problems were encountered with the cinemas ceiling, which have required significant repair work.
The cinema opened in October 2007.
Some of the costs associated with the additional repair works are being sought from the main contractors and the possibility of claiming other costs from the arising delay is also being pursued.

"24 Convertible Subordinated Unsecured Loan Stock In 1996 the Company issued 26 million of Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock ""CULS""."
Under IFRS these are accounted for as part debt and part equity.
Interest is charged on the debt at an effective rate of 11.25%, being the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt at the date of issue of the CULS, of which 6.75% is paid as a coupon and the balance rolled up in to the value of the debt.
Since 1996 all of the CULS have either been converted or bought back in the market by the Group.
At 30 December 2007 and at the date of this report, CULS with a nominal value of nil 2006: 1.7 million remained.
The balance sheet contains the following balances relating to CULS: 30 December 30 December 2007 2006 Note m m Nominal value of CULS 1.7 Equity component net of deferred tax 0.5 Deferred tax liability 0.1 1.1 Net interest 0.2 Liability component at balance sheet date 23 a, b 1.3 The CULS were convertible by the holders of the stock into 51.42 2006: 51.42 ordinary shares per 100 nominal value CULS in any of the years 1997 to 2015 inclusive, representing a conversion price of 194p 2006: 194p per ordinary share.
The Company had the right to redeem at par the CULS in any year from 2006 to 2016.
The CULS were unsecured and were subordinated to all other forms of unsecured debt but ranked in priority to the holders of the ordinary shares in the Company.
66 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2007 25 Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The Groups risk management policies and practices are as follows: Debt management The Group normally raises bank debt on a oating rate basis and xes a substantial portion of the interest payments by entering into interest rate swaps.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity prole and to maintain short term liquidity.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions.
The Group is exposed to fair value risk from its xed rate debt and interest rate risk from its oating rate debt and cash.
Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from xed to oating rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of xed to oating rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate prole against these guidelines.
The Group has interest rate swaps of 460 million 2006: 281 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the Company pays interest at a xed rate of 4.76% 2006: 4.84% and receives interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
At 30 December 2007, the fair value of these swaps was an asset of 1.9 million 2006: 3.4 million.
The Group does not hedge account its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
Cash management Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
These amounts are presented net of all allowances for doubtful receivables, and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and tenants.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses net investment hedging to hedge its exposure to the Euro and its German operations.
The Group has entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to hedge its German net assets.

The fair value of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using market discount rates.
Details of the Groups cash and deposits are set out in note 19.
Their fair values and those of other financial assets and liabilities equate to their book values.
All other financial assets and liabilities are non interest bearing and their fair value equals their book value.

At the date of issue the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of the issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the option to convert the liability into equity of the Group is included in equity.
2 The acquisition reserve relates to the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Morrison Merlin in 2005.
Prior to the 2005 acquisition Morrison Merlin was a joint venture in which Capital & Regional had a 50% interest.
The acquisition reserve arose from the difference between the fair value of the Companys existing 50% interest and the carrying value of that interest at the date of acquisition of the outstanding 50%.
The reserve which will remain in the balance sheet until Morrison Merlin is sold.
3 IFRS reserve relates to the requirements of IFRS 1.
Where cash flow hedge accounting was being applied under a previous GAAP, IFRS 1 requires reserves are debited with the fair value of hedging derivatives at the date of transition for the Group to IFRS 31 December 2004.
The entire gain or loss has been taken to equity and will be recycled to the income statement when the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss or as soon as the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
As the hedged transactions are still expected to occur, amounts remain in the reserve.
