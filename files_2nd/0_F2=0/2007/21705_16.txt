 LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors London 24 September 2007 BlueBay Asset Management plc 56 Annual Report 2007 Significant accounting policies BlueBay Asset Management plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985.
The Group Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2007 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries the Group.
The significant accounting policies are summarised below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented.
a Basis of preparation The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and relevant International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB as adopted by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held at fair value through profit or loss.
b Basis of consolidation The Group Financial Statements incorporates Financial Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries prepared to 30 June each year.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Groups Financial Statements from the date that control begins to the date that control ceases.
The subsidiaries of the Company are: BlueBay Funds Management Company S. A. BlueBay Asset Management Japan Limited BlueBay Asset Management USA LLC The Groups Employee Benefit Trusts are also consolidated in the Groups Financial Statements.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated in full on consolidation.
Neither the Directors nor shareholders have the power to amend the Financial Statements after issue.
c Changes in accounting policies and disclosures IFRIC interpretations and amendments to existing standards that became effective during the year have been applied by the Group.
These amendments have not had a material impact on the Financial Statements or accounting policies.
d New IFRS standards and interpretations not applied The following IFRSs and interpretations were available for early application but have not been applied in these Financial Statements.
The Group has assessed the impact of these new standards and interpretations and has concluded it is not likely to have a significant impact on the Groups results.
i IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosure and an amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements on capital disclosures were issued by the IASB in August 2005 and are required to be adopted by the Group for reporting in its financial year ended 30 June 2008.
This new standard and the revision to IAS 1 add further quantitative and qualitative disclosures in relation to financial instruments and how an entity manages its capital resources.
ii IFRS 8 Operating segments was issued in November 2006 and, if adopted by the EU, will be required to be adopted by the Group for reporting in its financial year 30 June 2010.
The new standard adopts a management approach under which segmental information is to be disclosed on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
iii IFRIC 8 clarifies that transactions within the scope of IFRS 2 Share Based Payment include those in which the entity cannot specifically identify some or all of the goods and services received.
iv IFRIC 9 clarifies that an entity should assess whether an embedded derivative is required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative when the entity first becomes a party to the contract.
Subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change in the contract terms, in which case it is required.
v IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment refers to impairment losses recognised in a previous interim period in respect of goodwill or an investment in an equity instrument carried at cost should not be reversed in subsequent periods.
vi IFRIC 11 Group and Treasury Share Transactions addresses if certain transactions should be accounted for as equity-settled or cashsettled under the requirement of IFRS 2.
It also addresses share-based payment arrangements that involve two or more entities within the same group.
BlueBay Asset Management plc Annual Report 2007 57 e Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of the Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the Financial Statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modified as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where a higher degree of judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group Financial Statements, are discussed below.
i Estimating the fair value of share-based payments Prior to listing, the Group had been required to make various valuation assumptions in order to account for share-based payments.
These are explained fully in note 19. ii Intangible assets The valuation and amortisation periods of intangible assets on acquisition, such as computer software, and the impairment testing is based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.
iii Staff costs An estimate of the future liability for bonuses and other employee incentive schemes is included in staff costs.
iv Surplus premises The Group periodically reviews its premises requirements and makes provisions where necessary if the Group has no current need for premises to which the Group is already contractually committed under the terms of an operating lease agreement.
The calculation of any required provision requires significant judgement, as the Group needs to estimate the provision based upon discounted future cash outflows due to be paid under the lease less any potential cash inflows from sub-letting arrangements that the Group is able to negotiate.
These cash flows are then discounted for the remaining lease period.
In estimating these cash flows, the Group consults with external advisers in the relevant location to understand the potential to sub-let the premises, the rental rates which could be achieved and the potential amount and time period of any leasehold inducements which may need to be offered to successfully secure a sub-tenant.
f Presentation of exceptional items The Group has shown exceptional items separately on the face of the Income Statement.
The Group defines exceptional items as those material items, by virtue of their size or nature, which the Group considers should be presented separately in order to aid comparability between periods.
g Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
The principal activity of the Group is the provision of investment management services.
The business segments are the primary reporting segments.
As the Group only operates in one business segment, no additional business segmental analysis has been shown.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of components operating in other economic environments.
The Group operates in Europe, Asia and North America.
The analyses by geographical segment are based on the location of the customer.
This is the location where the fund product entities are registered, or segregated client accounts are domiciled, from which fee income is earned.
h Intangible assets Computer software licences acquired are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Direct costs include software development and associated contractor costs.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
The following useful lives have been determined for the intangible assets acquired during the year: Computer software licences 3-5 years Software development costs 5 years BlueBay Asset Management plc 58 Annual Report 2007 Significant accounting policies continued i Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost, less subsequent depreciation and impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the assets.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repair and maintenance expenditures are charged to the Income Statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life as follows: Leasehold improvements 3-5 years Furniture, fixtures and fittings 3 years Information and communication technology equipment 3-5 years Major renovations are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset or to the date of the next major renovation, whichever is sooner.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the Income Statement.
j Investments i Classification All Group investments are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
These include the financial assets originally purchased as part of deferred compensation awards on behalf of employees and shown on the balance sheet, see note 13.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
ii Measurement Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are included in other operating income in the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
k Derivative financial instruments i Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group does not designate any derivatives as hedging instruments.
Derivatives are, therefore, initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The resulting gains or losses are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
Derecognition of derivative assets and liabilities occurs on the expiry date of the derivative contract.
ii Financial risk factors A qualitative analysis of the financial risks facing the Group, is provided in the Risk Management section to this Annual Report.
l Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amounts and the present value of their estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
m Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, deposits held on call with banks and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
n Liability for share-based payments Liabilities in respect of historic share-based payment transactions, which were cash-settled, are shown at their fair value at the balance sheet date in accordance with IFRS 2.
BlueBay Asset Management plc Annual Report 2007 59 o Provisions Provisions for costs, such as legal claims, are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
p Income recognition i Revenue Revenue comprises the fair value for the provision of services, net of any value added tax, rebates and discounts and after the elimination of sales within the Group.
Revenue is recognised as follows: a Performance fees are calculated by reference to the appreciation in the net asset value of the relevant fund during the performance period.
In accordance with IAS 18, performance fees are only recognised once they can be measured reliably.
The Group can only reliably measure performance fees at the end of the performance period as the net asset value of the relevant fund could move significantly, as a result of market movements, between the Groups balance sheet date and the end of the performance period.
b Management fees which include all non-performance related fees, are recognised in the period in which the services are rendered.
ii Interest income Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income.
q Fair value estimation The fair value of quoted financial assets is based on current bid prices.
The fair value of unlisted financial assets investments in the funds is based on the net asset valuations of the funds at the balance sheet date.
r Distribution agreements The Group operates a number of distribution agreements.
Commission payments made to intermediaries for ongoing services under these distribution agreements are charged to the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
There are no arrangements where commission payments are not for ongoing services.
s Leases Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
All the Groups leases are operating leases and the rental charges are included in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
As lessee, costs under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement in equal amounts over the periods of the leases.
Incentives received to enter into leases are amortised on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
t Employee benefits i Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution scheme.
Employees may contribute directly to this scheme.
The Group makes no contributions to the scheme and there is therefore no cost in the Group accounts.
ii Share-based compensation The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
These are explained in note 19 of these Financial Statements.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the share awards and options granted is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and options awarded granted.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity.
iii Deferred compensation plans The Group also operates deferred compensation plans under which a portion of an employees bonus is invested in one of the funds managed by the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the awards in the funds is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, remeasured at each reporting date until the settlement date is reached.
The fair value of the awards equates to the fair value of the underlying investment in the nominated fund entity at the settlement date.
BlueBay Asset Management plc 60 Annual Report 2007 Significant accounting policies continued iv Profit-sharing and bonus plans The Group operates non-contractual bonus pools based on formulas that take into consideration either Group profitability or its performance fee revenues, on a calendar year basis.
The formulas are reviewed and approved annually by the Remuneration Committee.
At the end of the financial year, the Group recognises a liability for bonus pools accrued but not yet paid.
u Foreign currency translation i Functional and presentation currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The Group Financial Statements are presented in Great British Pounds GBP, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency and the currency in which the majority of the Groups assets, liabilities and funding is denominated.
ii Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the relevant Group entitys functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or where it is more practical a Group entity may use an average rate for the week or month for all transactions in each foreign currency occurring during that week or month as long as the relevant exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in other operating income or losses in the Income Statement.
iii Group companies The results and financial position of all the Group entities none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: a assets and liabilities for each balance sheet are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: b income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates for the relevant accounting periods: and c all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
v Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all taxable and deductible temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
w Dividend distribution Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the Groups Financial Statements in the period in which the dividend is paid or approved by the Companys shareholders.
x Share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction from the share premium account.
y Own shares Employee trusts have been established for the purposes of satisfying certain equity-based awards.
The holdings of these trusts include shares own shares that have not vested unconditionally with employees of the Group.
Own shares are held for the short term to meet future award requirements and are recorded, at cost, as a deduction from equity.
These are shown separately on the face of the balance sheet with the intention to offset against retained earnings in the future.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders for the relevant period by the number of ordinary shares in existence less the weighted average number of own shares, after retrospectively taking into account the restructuring of the Companys share capital as described in note 21.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with further adjustments to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive ordinary shares.
There are no differences between the profit for each financial year attributable to equity holders used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.
The reconciliation of the figures used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is given below: 2007 2006 Total Weighted Total Weighted number average number average thousands thousands thousands thousands Number of shares at 1 July 2006 and 1 July 2005 120,000 120,000 120,000 120,000 Issue of shares 20,763 12,547 Shares reclassified from debt note 20 49,610 49,610 49,610 14,935 Number of shares at 30 June 2007 and 30 June 2006 190,373 182,157 169,610 134,935 Shares owned by employee trusts 785 511 Shares owned by Share Incentive trust 261 167 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 22 69,587 40,714 49,610 14,935 Basic number of shares 119,740 140,765 120,000 120,000 Shares owned by employee trusts 785 511 Shares owned by Share Incentive trust 261 167 Shares held in nominee account on behalf of employees note 22 69,587 40,714 49,610 14,935 Employee share options 8,670 8,083 28,400 1,929 Dilutive number of shares 199,043 190,240 198,010 136,864 Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Group 35,168 35,168 21,619 21,619 The weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of earnings per share has retrospectively been adjusted to take account of the impact of the nine for one bonus issue of shares on 1 November 2006, the recognition of equity shares that were previously classified as a liability and the share split which took place on 22 November 2006 note 21.

At 30 June 2007 and 2006, none of the above assets were held under finance leases.
A thorough review of the useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment was undertaken in May 2007, in light of the new leases taken on the premises at Grosvenor Street.
Following this review, the remaining useful economic life of leasehold improvements at the Groups existing Head Office premises in Times Place was shortened to eight months, with effect from 1 May 2007.
There was no change to the remaining useful economic life of furniture, fixtures and fittings and information and communication technology equipment, as the Group currently plans on utilising such assets in its new premises.
If these changes in the remaining useful economic life of leasehold improvements had not been applied, the depreciation charge in the year would have been lower by 221,000, with a corresponding impact on the results for the year for both the Group and the Company.

Share-based payments The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by management and employees, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the purchase of the Groups shares.
During the year, 687,000 was charged to the Income Statement in respect of equity settled, share-based payment transactions 2006: 81,000.
This expense was based on the fair value of the share-based payment transactions on grant date.
All of the expense arose under employee share awards made within the Groups share-based payment schemes.
Details of these schemes, including calculations of fair values of options and awards can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 40 to 45 of this Annual Report and are summarised as follows: i Enterprise Management Incentive EMI option award scheme Options granted under the Enterprise Management Incentive option award scheme qualified as Enterprise Management Incentive options under the provisions of sections 527 541 and Schedule 5 of the Income Tax Earnings & Pensions Act 2003.
All awards were granted on 19 December 2005.
Selected employees were eligible to participate.
Certain tax reliefs arising under the EMI award scheme would have been lost if the related options had not been exercised at Listing and as a result, 20,700,000 options under the EMI award scheme were exercised at that time.
As a condition of exercise, the Company required the holders of the EMI options to enter into an agreement not to sell their resulting shares for a period of up to four years following Listing although 25% of these ordinary shares become available for sale on each anniversary of the date of exercise of the EMI options.
75,000 EMI options were not exercised at Listing and they therefore reverted to unapproved options and are exercisable in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such options.
ii Unapproved Option award scheme The Group has a second option award scheme, not approved by HMRC, where selected employees were eligible to participate.
Awards granted were all made prior to Listing.
Awards were granted on or around 27 March 2006 in the previous financial year and further awards on 20 July 2006 and 19 October 2006 during the current financial year.
None of the Unapproved Options were exercised at Listing.
In general terms, providing an optionholder remains an employee of the Group, options may be exercised in accordance with a vesting schedule as follows: 25% on or after each of 30 January 2007, 30 January 2008, 30 January 2009 and 30 January 2010.
All Unapproved options expire on 30 January 2015.
BlueBay Asset Management plc 76 Annual Report 2007 Group notes to the financial statements continued 19.
Share-based payments continued The fair value of share options are calculated using the Black Scholes model, taking into account the effect of both financial and demographic assumptions.
Financial assumptions include the future share price volatility, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, and the best estimate outcome of non-market based performance conditions.
Demographic assumptions include forfeiture and early vesting behaviours that are based upon historic observable data.
The fair values per option and award granted during the year, and the assumptions used in the calculations, are as follows: Unapproved Option Unapproved Option Award Scheme Award Scheme Grant dates 20 July 2006 19 October 2006 Fair value underlying share at grant 0.1151 0.1956 Weighted average exercise price 0.2853 0.2853 Options awarded during the year 600,000 2,150,000 Average vesting period years 2.0 1.8 Expected share price volatility 19.7% 19.9% Dividend yield 4.1% 4.1% Risk-free rate 5.1% 5.3% Expected option life 3.6 years 3.6 years Number of options expected to vest 512,900 1,837,800 Average fair value per option grant 0.1120 0.2145 All option awards during the year were made prior to Listing.
The expected share price volatility is based on historical volatility over the last two years of FTSE All-share Financials Index, adjusted by a factor to give a single stock volatility.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk-free rate of return is the GBP swap curve for the term, consistent with the assumed option life.
The fair value share price at grant date has been calculated using an earnings multiple approach based on comparable quoted companies making various adjustments.
The main adjustments considered were fund concentration, earnings variability, private company, minority holdings and voting rights.

Additional details are included in note 20. iv Share incentive plan SIP The Group SIP is an HMRC approved plan which allows employees, including Directors, to acquire shares in the Company.
The scheme is open to UK based employees and provides free shares from the Group to each participating employee, based on an award of 3,000 worth of shares per employee.
The Group also provides free shares that match the employee purchase up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum in the ratio of two to one.
At listing, the Group purchased 300,000 shares at a weighted average share price of 3.00 2006: nil in order to satisfy such shares awards.
The fair value of the shares is measured on the grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the underlying shares.
The fair value of the shares granted is taken to be the market price at the date of award.
The amount recognised in the Income Statement is adjusted to reflect the expected and actual number of shares that vest.
Pursuant to these plans, the Group awarded 176,109 ordinary shares to employees 2006: nil at a weighted average share price of 4.03 2006: nil.
A charge of 710,000 2006: nil will be expensed over a vesting period of four years.
A further 38,512 shares were sold to employees as part of the matching shares concept note 22.
The Group holds the remaining 85,379 ordinary shares, which will be used to satisfy future share awards to employees.
Liability for cash-settled share-based transactions Liability for cash-settled share-based transactions relates to share subscriptions being shown as liabilities, due to the forfeiture provisions contained in the share agreements.
On 6 November 2006, amendments were made to the share agreements to remove the obligation of the Group to finance the repurchase of its shares in the event they were forfeited.
Shares subject to such arrangements have therefore been reclassified from liabilities to shareholders equity and are now treated as equity settled transactions.
