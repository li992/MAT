BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU, IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to those companies reporting under IFRS.
In the current year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 1 October 2006.
The adoption of these new and revised Standards and Interpretations has resulted in changes to the Group's accounting policies in the following areas that have affected the amounts reported for the current or prior years: IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease was adopted with effect from 1 October 2005.
The change in accounting policy required by IFRIC 4 results in a restatement of prior year figures Restated.
The amendments to IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as far as they relate to financial guarantee contracts.
This had no impact on the consolidated results at 30 September 2007.
IFRIC 6 Liabilities arising from Participating in a Specific Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment.
IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.
This had no impact on the consolidated results for periods prior to 1 October 2006.
In 2007, a charge of $0.5 million was incurred in an associate company.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Whilst these estimates and assumptions are based on the Directors' best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
Following a change in use of the Groups Campus property located in South Africa, the Group has accounted for the portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation as investment property.
Investment property is carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognised in income.
Restatement and new accounting policies IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease IFRIC 4, which was adopted in the current financial year, provides guidance on whether complex arrangements include a lease.
As a result of this requirement, certain arrangements required reclassification as leases.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, this has resulted in the derecognition of $5.9 million of property, plant and equipment at 1 October 2005 30 September 2006: $5.1 million and $1.2 million of inventory at 30 September 2006, offset by the recognition of finance lease receivables of $6.6 million at 30 September 2007 30 September 2006: $6.9 million.
As a consequence, net assets as at 1 October 2005 were restated from $407.3 million to $407.8 million $542.5 million to $543.1 million at 30 September 2006.
Operating profit for the year ended 30 September 2006 decreased by $0.5 million which was offset by a similar increase in interest and investment income of $0.6 million.
As a consequence, profit before tax for the year ended 30 September 2006 increased by $0.1 million.
Investment property At 31 December 2006, following the change in use of the Campus property, the portion held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation was classified as investment property.
Investment properties are stated at fair value.
When property is transferred to investment property following a change in use, any differences arising at the date of transfer between net book value and valuation are taken to equity.
This resulted in a credit to equity of $4.1 million net of deferred tax charge of $1.7 million.
Any subsequent valuations are included in the income statement.
This resulted in a credit to property revaluation and other gains and losses in the income statement of $22.2 million and a deferred tax charge of $6.4 million.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were issued but not effective: 54 Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 Pronouncement Effective year end for Dimension Data IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and concurrent amendment to IAS 1 to add capital disclosures 30 September 2008 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 30 September 2010 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and Treasury Share Transactions 30 September 2008 IAS 23 Amendments 30 September 2010 The Directors are in the process of evaluating the measurement and disclosure requirements that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations will have in future periods when the relevant standards come into effect for the Group.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies set out below have been used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the Company financial statements where applicable.
The consolidated financial information has been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and the investment property.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities including special purpose entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the combination.
Losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interest of the Group except to the extent that the minority has a binding legal obligation and is able to make additional investment to cover the losses.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less cost to sell.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of the associate in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 55 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2007 continued Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited in the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of the investment.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of the annual impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Revenue from contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on contracts see below.
Maintenance revenue and licence fees are brought to account over the relevant contract periods.
Where the Group acts as agent and is remunerated on a commission basis, the commission is included in revenue.
Where the Group acts as principal, the total value of business handled is included in revenue.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
This is normally measured by the proportion that contract costs 56 Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable that they will result in revenue, and they are capable of being reliably measured.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Contact centre revenue is recognised according to the stage of completion of the contract by reference to the value of work performed.
The amount by which revenue differs from payments on account is shown under receivables as accrued revenue, or under payables as deferred revenue, as appropriate.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Group as lessor Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as receivables at the amount of the Groups net investment in the leases.
Finance lease income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of return on the Groups net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group as lessee Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly in the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The Group has elected to present its results in US dollars as this is the currency predominantly used when the Group transacts.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the income statement for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currency are not retranslated.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts and options see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 57 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2007 continued For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and associates that report in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are restated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date before they are translated into US dollars.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment in specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants towards staff re-training costs are recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Government grants relating to property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income and released to the income statement over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Operating profit Profit from operations is stated after charging restructuring costs but before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those items of financial performance that are material and non-recurring in nature that the Group believes should be disclosed separately within the financial statements to assist in the understanding of the financial performance of the Group.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is 58 Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the depreciable value of the assets over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Capitalised property finance lease 2% per annum Leasehold land, buildings and improvements Over the lease term Computer and workshop equipment 14% 33% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum Certain costs of purchase, development and installation of major information systems including packaged software are capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives generally three to five years on a straight line basis.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in estimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
Investment property Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and or for capital appreciation, is measured initially at its cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment property is measured at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment property are included in the income statement for the period in which they arise.
Intangible assets Acquired intangible assets Purchased intangible assets, which include customer lists and intellectual property, are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
Computer software Computer software is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and, where appropriate, provision for impairment in value or estimated loss on disposal.
Acquired computer software is capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of between three to five years.
The SAP software is written off over seven years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred, unless they increase the future economic benefits of the asset, in which case they are capitalised.
Internally generated computer software is capitalised at cost if the project is technically and commercially feasible and the economic benefits that are expected to be generated exceed one year.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 59 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2007 continued increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assets to which it relates.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of assets on a straight line basis between three and seven years.
Internally-generated intangible assets research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups Solutions business is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: An asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives, generally between three and five years.
Where no internally-generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Patents and trademarks Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the weighted average method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income 60 Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 statement when there is evidence that the asset is impaired.
The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
At subsequent reporting dates, debt securities that the Group has the expressed intention and ability to hold to maturity heldto-maturity debt securities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment loss recognised to reflect irrecoverable amounts.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, and is measured as the difference between the investments carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.
Impairment losses are reversed in subsequent periods when an increase in the investments recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, subject to the restriction that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed shall not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Investments other than held-to-maturity debt securities are classified as either investments held for trading or as available for sale, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held for trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for equity investments classified as available for sale are not subsequently reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in the income statement for debt instruments classified as available for sale are subsequently reversed if an increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the recognition of the impairment loss.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried in the parent Company balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairments.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equities Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for borrowing costs see above.
Convertible loan notes Convertible loan notes are regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
On conversion of the instruments the value of the debt is transferred to equity reserves.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 61 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2007 continued Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions.
Such derivatives are initially recorded at fair value, if any, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of designated fair value hedges and derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made for the amount of the obligation.
Where the effect of discounting to present value is material, provisions are adjusted to reflect the time value of money.
Provisions for warranty costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management uses all available information and the application of judgement is inherent in the formation of estimates.
Actual results in the future could differ from these estimates, and any subsequent changes are accounted for with an effect in income at the time such information becomes available.
Revenue and profit recognition Revenue and profit on contracts are generally recognised on a percentage of completion basis when the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably.
Management is required to use judgement in determining whether a contracts outcome can be estimated reliably.
Management also makes estimates of total contract costs, which are used in determining the value of amounts recoverable on contracts.
Share-based payment The expense for the share schemes is determined by estimating the fair value of the options granted.
Details of the valuation methods and assumptions used are set out in Note 38.
Provision for bad debts Provision is made for bad debts based on managements estimate of the prospect of recovering the debt.
Where management has determined that a debt is no longer recoverable, the amount is written off.
Provision for inventory Inventory is counted at least once a year and any shortages and obsolete stock identified are written off immediately.
An allowance is made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical trends.
Provision against slow moving and obsolete stock at 30 September 2007 amounted to $90.0 million 2006: $80.5 million.
Impairment of goodwill Management is required to estimate whether or not goodwill has been impaired.
This requires estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the cash-generating units, including managements estimates of long term operating margins and long term growth rates.
Income taxes Management makes estimates of the likely outcome of decisions by tax authorities on transactions and events whose treatment for tax purposes is uncertain.
When the final outcome of such matters is different, or expected to be different, from previous assessments made by management, a change to the tax provision will be recorded in the period when that decision is made.
Residual value on property, plant and equipment In general no residual values are attached to the Groups property, plant and equipment due to the nature of these items.
However, management have applied a residual value to the Campus asset.
Residual value is an estimate of the amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life.
Valuation of investment property The portion of the Campus property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation has been classified as investment property and is stated at fair value.
Management have carried out a valuation based on a rental income yield.

GEOGRAPHIC AND BUSINESS SEGMENTS Geographic segments For management purposes, the Group is organised regionally and these regions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Geographic segment information about these regions is presented below.
Operating income from the Campus property in Johannesburg has been reallocated from the Middle East and Africa segment and included in Central and Other in 2007.
This resulted in an increase in Centrals segment result of $12.4 million in 2006 and a corresponding decrease in Middle East and Africa.
The 2006 figures have been adjusted accordingly.
Inter-company sales are charged at prevailing market prices.

There has been no impairment to goodwill.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group has prepared forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors.
The discount rates used range between 10.1% and 15.1%.
Growth factors applied to expected earnings were between 10% to 20%.

The share appreciation rights all vest three years after the grant date.
The vesting of the options is subject to various non-market performance criteria.
All SARS expire six years from grant date.
The participants will receive an amount equal to the increase in value between the grant date and the exercise date.
Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP provides the employees, at the date the rights vest, the right to receive shares as stipulated by the grant certificate.
The LTIPs vest in one tranche, approximately three years after the grant date.
The vesting of the majority of the LTIPs is subject to market performance conditions, based on the relative total shareholder return TSR of Dimension Data to that of each of a group of peer companies.
All LTIPs expire on vesting date, i. e. three years from date of grant.
The participants will be awarded rights to ordinary shares in the Company.
Valuation methods The fair value of the options granted in terms of the Dimension Data Holdings plc share option scheme and SARS are estimated using an actuarial binomial option pricing model.
The Monte Carlo Simulation process for the LTIP valuation is used to model a real life situation with stochastic properties.
An example of such a process is the movement in share prices.
Share prices have an underlying distribution, which can be estimated and used to calculate likely distribution of future share prices.
Taking into account the expected growth in share price, assuming a log-normal distribution, the model projects the future share prices.
Inputs into the model The following inputs were used to value the options, SARS and LTIPS granted: Weighted Exercise Expected Expected average price at option Expected dividend Risk-free Financial years ended share price grant date lifetime volatility yield interest rate 30 September years % % % Share Option Scheme Post 2000 2003 JSE R3.94 R3.71 7 59.2 62.4 10.06 11.12 Share Option Scheme Post 2000 2003 LSE 0.26 0.25 7 59.2 63.7 3.80 4.56 Share Option Scheme Post 2000 2004 JSE R4.03 R4.03 7 63.7 9.69 Share Option Scheme Post 2000 2004 LSE 0.34 0.33 7 63.3 64.3 4.91 5.18 SARS 2005 0.37 0.37 4 70.1 70.5 4.49 4.81 LTIPs 2005 0.37 3 78.7 4.51 LTIPs 2006 0.37 3 48.23 56.66 4.29 4.87 LTIPs 2007 0.39 3 43.26 4.79 No changes in assumptions were made to the Share Option Scheme Post 2000 subsequent to 2004.
The expected option lifetime was arrived at based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and exercise behaviour considerations.
The estimated attrition rate for SARS and LTIPs was between 4% to 8% 2006: 6% to 10%.
The expected volatility was determined based on the rolling historical volatility over the expected option lifetime that prevailed at the grant date.
Dimension Data Annual Report 2007 85 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 September 2007 continued 38.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 38 a Dimension Datas schemes continued The risk-free interest rate used is the yield on the zero-coupon South African government bonds and a UK gilt strip of a term consistent with the expected option lifetime.
Modifications to share-based payments For options which were originally granted on 21 November 2002 under the Dimension Data Holdings plc Share Option Scheme Post 2000, the vesting dates of 20,754,173 options were altered on 21 November 2003.
These options vested over three tranches, ending on 21 November 2006.
The incremental fair value of 1.8 million was the increase in the value under the new vesting terms as valued at the date of modification.
This incremental fair value was determined using the actuarial binomial model.
The principal inputs used in determining the incremental fair value are detailed in the table below: Exercise Expected Expected UK risk-free price at option Expected dividend interest Weighted average share price grant date lifetime volatility yield rate Years % % % 0.35 0.25 7 63.7 4.99 38 b Datacraft Asias Datacraft schemes Datacraft Asia has two share option schemes, namely the Previous Scheme and the Scheme 2003.
The Previous Scheme was adopted in 1996.
During the financial year ended 30 September 2003, the Previous Scheme was terminated and replaced by the Scheme 2003.
The termination of the Previous Scheme does not affect the rights of outstanding options granted under the Previous Scheme.
However, upon the termination of the Previous Scheme on 27 February 2003, no further options were granted under the Previous Scheme.
Details of the share options under the Previous Scheme outstanding during the year are as follows: 2007 2006 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price $ $ Outstanding at the beginning of the year 13,097,000 1.993 14,991,000 1.941 Exercised during the year 1,606,000 0.725 789,000 0.725 Lapsed during the year 837,000 2.565 1,105,000 2.193 Outstanding at the end of the year 10,654,000 2.139 13,097,000 1.993 Exercisable at the end of the year 10,654,000 2.139 11,215,500 2.206 The weighted average share price at the date of the exercise for share options exercised during the year was $1.174 2006: $1.028.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.2 years 2006: 5.4 years.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT continued 38 b Datacraft Asias Datacraft schemes continued Details of the share options under the Scheme 2003 outstanding during the year are as follows: 2007 2006 Number of Weighted average Number of Weighted average share options exercise price share options exercise price $ $ Outstanding at the beginning of the year 15,736,000 1.048 11,884,000 0.982 Granted during the year 7,853,000 1.080 6,565,000 1.140 Exercised during the year 1,521,000 0.963 455,000 0.835 Lapsed during the year 2,367,000 1.087 2,258,000 1.012 Outstanding at the end of the year 19,701,000 1.062 15,736,000 1.048 Exercisable at the end of the year 5,244,750 1.071 3,348,250 1.060 The weighted average share price at the date of the exercise for share options exercised during the year was $1.197 2006: $1.050.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 6.3 years 2006: 7.2 years.
In FY2007, options were granted on 15 March 2007.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on 15 March 2007 were between $0.24 and $0.35.
In FY2006, options were granted on 20 February 2006.
The estimated fair values of the options granted on 20 February 2006 were between $0.25 and $0.42.
These fair values were calculated using the binomial option pricing model.
The inputs into the model were as follows: 2007 2006 Share price at date of grant 1.10 1.11 Exercise price 1.08 1.14 Expected volatility 38% 43% Contractual life 7 years 7 years Risk-free rate 4.51% to 4.68% 4.60% to 4.71% Expected dividend yield 3% 1.20% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of Datacrafts share price over the previous three years.
It was assumed that employees who voluntarily resign would have exercised their options before they resign if the share price at the point of exercise exceeds the exercise price.
It was further assumed that employees will only exercise their options if the share price at that moment exceeds the exercise price by 15% 2006: 15%.
Performance Share Plan On 20 January 2006, the shareholders of Datacraft approved a new performance share plan Datacraft Asia Performance Share Plan under which awards of fully paid-up shares will be granted, free of payment, to selected employees, when and after pre-determined performance targets and or service conditions are accomplished.
The awards may be settled with new shares, treasury shares or cash or combinations thereof at the sole discretion of Datacraft.
No such performance shares were granted during the financial year.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Trade and other receivables The average credit period taken on sale of goods was 60 days 2006: 62 days.
An allowance of $31.9 million 2006: $25.9 million for irrecoverable trade receivables has been determined on specific receivables and by reference to past default experience.
No interest is charged on outstanding receivable balances.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Bank balances and cash These comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximate their fair value.
Trade and other payables Trade payables and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases was 51 days 2006: 52 days.
The Directors consider the carrying value of trade payables to approximate their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Currency derivatives The Group hedges its transactional foreign exchange risk, using forward exchange contracts, as soon as there is a firm contractual commitment.
Speculative use of financial instruments or derivatives is not permitted and none has occurred during any periods presented.
At balance sheet date, total notional amounts outstanding in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are as below: 2007 2006 $000 $000 Forward foreign exchange contracts These arrangements are designed to address significant exchange exposures for the first half of FY2008, and are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
Fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts: Assets 2,505 4,580 Liabilities 3,975 737 1,470 3,843 These amounts are based on market values of equivalent instruments at balance sheet date.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective cash flow hedges amounting to $0.2 million 2006: $2.3 million has been deferred in equity.
Financial assets comprise: investments held for trading, available for sale investments, long and short term trade and other receivables excluding the provision for bad debts, tax authorities receivable, cash and cash equivalents, current asset portion of assets classified as held for sale and other financial instruments.
Financial liabilities comprise: other long term liabilities, bank loans and overdrafts, trade and other payables, tax authorities payable, liabilities held for sale and other financial instruments.
39 b Interest rates and currency profiles The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling, Australian dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are generally economically hedged and therefore there are limited transactional exposures that would give rise to net currency gains and losses in the income statement.
The interest rate profiles of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Restated 2007 2006 Financial Financial Financial Financial assets liabilities assets liabilities $000 $000 $000 $000 Floating interest rates 381,417 24,497 127,839 45,815 Fixed interest rates 71,918 195,192 86,307 125,542 Non-interest bearing 1,085,123 1,202,648 977,673 927,431 1,538,458 1,422,337 1,191,819 1,098,788 Floating rate financial assets include cash at bank and in hand and cash equivalents.
