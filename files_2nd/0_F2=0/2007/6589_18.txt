Financial Statements 74 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting policies and presentation The Groups key accounting policies are summarised below.
Basis of preparation and consolidation The Group consolidated financial statements are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2007.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and with those IFRS standards and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective and endorsed by the European Union as at the time of preparing these statements.
The Group consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group and the Group's share of the results and equity of its joint ventures.
Subsidiaries are entities over which, either directly or indirectly, the Company has control through the power to govern financial operating policies so as to obtain benefit from their activities.
This power is generally accompanied by a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the Groups results from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
All business combinations are accounted for by the purchase method.
Joint ventures are entities in which the Group has a long term interest and exercises joint control with its partners over their financial and operating policies.
In all cases voting rights are 50% or lower.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for by the equity method.
The Group's share of equity includes goodwill arising on acquisition.
In a single case the Company indirectly owns 100% of the voting share capital of an entity but is precluded from exercising either control or joint control by a contractual agreement with the United States Department of Defense.
In accordance with IAS 27 this entity has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
Further details are contained in note 13.
Intra-group transactions and balances and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, together with those with joint ventures, are eliminated.
The profit or loss on discontinued operations comprises the trading results up to the date of disposal or discontinuance and the profit or loss on the disposal or closure where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the financial statements are approved.
A discontinued operation is a business or businesses that have either been disposed of or closed or satisfies the criteria to be classified as held for sale and that represents either a material line of business within the Group or within one of its reported segments or a primary geographical area of operation.
Where businesses fall to be treated as discontinued in the current year the comparative data is reclassified to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Minority interests represent the portion of shareholders earnings and equity attributable to third party shareholders not belonging to the Group.
Presentation of the income statement IFRS is not prescriptive as to the format of the income statement.
The format used by the Group, in arriving at the results of continuing operations, in these financial statements is explained below.
Sales shown in the income statement are those of continuing subsidiary companies only.
Operating profit is the pre-finance profit of continuing subsidiary companies and, in order to achieve consistency and comparability between reporting periods, is analysed to show separately the results of normal trading performance and individually significant charges and credits.
Such items arise because of their size or nature and, in 2007, comprise: charges relating to the Groups strategic restructuring programme announced in 2004, the impact of the annual goodwill impairment review, asset impairment and restructuring charges which arise from events which are significant to any reportable segment, amortisation of the fair value of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations, profits or losses on businesses sold or closed which do not meet the definition of discontinued operations or which the Group views as capital rather than revenue in nature, and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments between the opening and closing balance sheets.
The Groups post-tax share of joint venture profits is shown as a separate component of profit before tax.
Net finance costs are analysed to show separately interest payable, interest receivable and the net of interest payable on post-employment obligations and the expected return on pension scheme assets.
Restatement of 2006 comparatives for presentation purposes The 2006 trading profit of the Group has been reanalysed in respect of the results of GKN Sheepbridge Stokes, the UK cylinder liner business which formed a significant component of the Other Automotive segment.
The closure of this operation was announced in January 2007.
Trading has ceased during the year, and its trading results are shown as a separate component of operating profit within the caption Profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses.
Sales of the business in the year were 22 million 200627 million and are included in total Group sales.
In the segmental analysis note 2, comparative figures for the Driveline and OffHighway segments have been restated by equal and opposite amounts in respect of two businesses formerly reported in Driveline, the customer and the product base of which has become increasingly focused on offhighway applications.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 75 Finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of the 2006 acquisitions of Stellex Aerostructures, Rockford Powertrain and Liuzhou Steel Rim Factory Liuzhou were made in the year.
As required under IFRS 3, amendments to provisional fair values have been shown as a prior period restatement.
As a consequence, and only in respect of Liuzhou, intangible fixed assets have been restated to recognise non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations of 1 million with an equal reduction in the value of goodwill.
The impact of the presentational changes noted above on the previously reported 2006 figures is set out below: As previously reported Restated Trading profit m 242 251 Operating profit m 203 203 Profit after taxation for the year m 177 177 Basic earnings per share p 25.0 25.0 Adjusted earnings per share p 28.8 30.1 Net assets m 908 908 Retained earnings m 589 589 Foreign currencies Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates account in the currency of their primary economic environment of operation, determined having regard to the currency which mainly influences sales revenue and input costs.
Transactions of subsidiaries are translated at exchange rates approximating to the rate ruling on the date of the transaction except in the case of material transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currencies are protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The Group's presentational currency is sterling.
On consolidation, results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Their assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on the realisation of currency net investments include the accumulated net exchange differences that have arisen on the retranslation of the currency net investments since 1 January 2004 up to the date of realisation.
Derivative financial instruments The Group does not trade in derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments including forward foreign exchange contracts are used by the Group to manage its exposure to i changes in the fair value of recognised assets and liabilities, ii risk associated with the variability in cash flows in relation to both recognised assets or liabilities or forecast transactions and iii changes in the value of the Groups net investment in overseas operations.
All derivative financial instruments are measured at the balance sheet date at their fair value.
Where derivative financial instruments are not designated as or not determined to be effective hedges, any gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the instrument at the balance sheet date is taken to the income statement.
Where derivative financial instruments are held as and are effective as cash flow hedges against the fair value changes in recognised assets and liabilities, remeasurement gains and losses on the instrument are matched against the remeasurement gain or loss on the recognised asset and liability in the income statement.
Remeasurement gains and losses on derivative financial instruments held as net investment hedges are recognised in equity via the statement of recognised income and expense until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the income statement.
Any derivative financial instruments no longer designated as effective hedges are restated at market value and any gains or losses are taken directly to the income statement.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised at their fair value when the nature, characteristics and risks of the derivative are not closely related to the host contract.
Gains and losses arising on the remeasurement of these embedded derivatives at each balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Other financial instruments Borrowings are measured at their amortised cost unless they are matched by an associated effective hedging financial instrument in which case they are stated at their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and overdrafts together with highly liquid investments of less than three months maturity.
Unless an enforceable right of set-off exists and there is an intention to net settle, the components of cash and cash equivalents are reflected on a gross basis in the balance sheet.
The carrying value of other financial assets and liabilities, including short term receivables and payables, are stated at amortised cost less any impairment provision unless the impact of the time value of money is considered to be material.
Financial Statements 76 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Sales and revenue recognition Revenue from the sales of goods and services is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable which generally equates to the invoiced amount, excluding sales taxes and net of allowances for returns, early settlement discounts and rebates.
Invoices for goods are raised when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed which, dependent upon contractual terms, may be at the point of dispatch, acceptance by the customer or, in Aerospace, certification by the customer.
Invoices for services are raised on the basis of hours worked or the achievement of contractual deliverables which have been agreed by the customer.
Revenue is recognised in the income statement when it can be reliably measured and its collectability is reasonably assured.
Royalty and licence income is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with relevant agreements and included within sales.
Intangible assets All intangible assets, excluding goodwill arising on a business combination, are stated at cost fair value on initial recognition and subsequently carried at their amortised cost or fair value less any provision for impairment.
Research and development costs Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take place, it is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the products life up to a maximum of 7 years in Automotive and 15 years in Aerospace starting from the date on which serial production commences.
Costs are capitalised as intangible assets unless physical assets, such as tooling, exist when they are classified as property, plant and equipment.
Computer software costs Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets.
Amortisation is provided on a straight line basis over its economic useful life which is in the range of 35 years.
Acquired non-operating intangible assets business combinations Non-operating intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination including but not limited to customer contracts and relationships, order backlog, patents and know-how, proprietary technology, brand names and trademarks, other intellectual property rights, and agreements not to compete that can be separately measured at fair value on a reliable basis, are separately recognised on acquisition at their fair value.
Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to the income statement over their expected useful lives which are: Years Brands trademarks 3050 Intellectual property rights 510 Customer contracts and relationships 215 Proprietary technology and know-how 710 Agreements not to compete 3 Goodwill business combinations Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the fair value of the consideration over the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible assets net of the fair value of the liabilities including contingencies of businesses acquired at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of business combinations of subsidiaries is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associated undertaking is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where negative goodwill arises, following reassessment of fair values, it is credited to the income statement in the period in which the acquisition is made.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses that arise from the annual assessment of its carrying value.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the value in use, determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows or recoverable amount, goodwill is written down to the value in use and an impairment charge is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment when events occur or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Goodwill, capitalised development costs and acquired non-operating intangibles are subject to annual impairment reviews and assessments.
Impairments arising are charged to the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Cost Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but excludes interest.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 77 Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, these values have been retained as book values and therefore deemed cost at the date of the IFRS transition.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or capital work in progress.
In the case of all other categories of asset, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the course of the financial year.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed annually.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Years Freehold buildings Up to 50 Steel powder production plant 18 General plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings 615 Computers 35 Commercial vehicles and cars 45 Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the income statement, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement as incurred over the lease term.
Inventories Inventories are valued on a FIFO or weighted average cost basis at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Taxation Current and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement unless they relate to items recognised directly in equity when the related tax is also recognised in equity.
Full provision is made for deferred tax on all temporary timing differences resulting from the difference between the carrying value of an asset or liability in the consolidated financial statements and its tax base.
The amount of deferred tax reflects the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against future taxable profits.
Deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of joint ventures.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted profits of overseas branches and subsidiaries except to the extent that it is probable that such earnings will be remitted to the parent in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-employment benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit arrangements which provide certain employees with defined postemployment healthcare benefits.
The Group accounts for all post-employment defined benefit schemes through full recognition of the schemes surpluses or deficits on the balance sheet at the end of each year.
Actuarial gains and losses are included in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Current and past service costs, curtailments and settlements are recognised within operating profit.
Returns on scheme assets and interest on obligations are recognised as a component of other net financing charges.
For defined contribution arrangements the cost charged to the income statement represents the Groups contributions to the relevant schemes in the period in which they fall due.
Financial Statements 78 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Accounting policies and presentation continued Share-based payments Share-based incentive arrangements are provided to employees under the Groups share option, incentive and other share award schemes.
Share options granted to employees and share-based arrangements put in place since 7 November 2002 are valued at the date of grant or award using an appropriate option pricing model and are charged to operating profit over the performance or vesting period of the scheme.
The annual charge is modified to take account of shares forfeited by employees who leave during the performance or vesting period and, in the case of non-market related performance conditions, where it becomes unlikely the option will vest.
Government grants Grants receivable from governments or similar bodies are credited to the balance sheet in the period in which the conditions relating to the grant are met.
Where they relate to specific assets they are amortised on a straight line basis over the same period as the asset is depreciated.
Where they relate to revenue expenditure and or non-asset criteria they are taken to the income statement to match the period in which the expenditure is incurred and criteria met.
Treasury shares GKN shares which have been purchased and not cancelled are held as treasury shares and deducted from shareholders equity.
Dividends The annual final dividend is not provided for until approved at the Annual General Meeting whilst interim dividends are charged in the period they are paid.
Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued and applied During the year ended 31 December 2007 the Group adopted the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations.
IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' and the amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements regarding capital disclosures.
IFRS 7 introduces new and revised disclosures for financial instruments and for risks associated with financial instruments.
As a disclosure based standard there have been no changes in either accounting policies or the primary financial statements.
The following standards and interpretations had no material impact on the Group's results, assets or liabilities or were not relevant: IFRS 4 Insurance contracts.
IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies.
IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
Standards, amendments to standards and interpretations issued but not yet applied IFRS 8 Operating Segments was issued in November 2006 and is required to be implemented from 1 January 2009.
It requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance, and supersedes IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
The effect of this standard on Group disclosures has not been determined at this stage.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations are unlikely to have a material impact on the Groups results, assets or liabilities or are not relevant: IAS 23 Amendment Borrowing Costs.
IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions.
IFRIC 14 IAS 19 the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
Significant judgements, key assumptions and estimates The Groups significant accounting policies are set out above.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates, subjective judgement and assumptions that may affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported profit and earnings for the year.
The Directors base these estimates, judgements and assumptions on a combination of past experience, professional expert advice and other evidence that is relevant to the particular circumstance.
The accounting policies where the Directors consider the more complex estimates, judgements and assumptions have to be made are those in respect of acquired non-operating intangible assets business combinations note 25, post-employment obligations note 27, derivative financial instruments notes 3e and 20, taxation notes 5 and 22 and impairment of non-current assets notes 10 and 11.
The details of the principal estimates, judgements and assumptions made are set out in the related notes as identified.

Intra-group sales, which are priced on an arms length basis between segments and regions are not significant.
The analyses of operating profit by business includes an allocation, based on their nature, of costs incurred centrally in the United Kingdom, United States of America, China and Germany.
Unallocated costs represent corporate expenses.
Segment assets and liabilities comprise all non-current and current items as per the balance sheet but exclude taxation, borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are not allocated to specific segments as these resources are managed centrally and no business in any segment has sufficient autonomy to manage these resources.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year.

ii IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires inventory recognised on business combinations to be fair valued.
Generally this requires uplifting inventory from its historical purchase or manufactured cost to current market values being current replacement cost for raw materials and consumables and adjusted selling price for work in progress and finished goods.
This fair value adjustment recognised on acquisition is charged to the income statement as this inventory is sold.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 83 iii Reorganisation costs shown above reflect ongoing actions in the ordinary course of business to reduce costs, improve productivity and rationalise facilities in continuing operations.
Costs incurred include redundancy and related post-employment obligation charges, asset write-downs and impairments and other revenues and expenditures directly attributable to the reorganisation actions.
Headcount realignment activity continued at a cost of 3 million 2006 4 million.
Rationalisation of a UK facility continued at a cost of 2 million, including a 1 million plant and equipment impairment charge 2006 4 million net surplus including land disposal surpluses amounting to 5 million.
iv Research and development expenditure in subsidiaries was 81 million 200675 million.
v Including property surpluses of 4 million 20061 million.
vi Auditors remuneration The analysis of auditors remuneration is as follows: 2007 2006 m m Fees payable to  LLP for the Companys annual financial statements 0.6 0.5 Fees payable to  LLP and their associates for other services to the Group: Audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 2.8 2.8 Total audit fees 3.4 3.3 Other services pursuant to legislation 0.1 0.1 Tax services 0.5 0.6 Corporate finance transaction services 0.1 Other services 0.1 0.1 Total non-audit fees 0.7 0.9 Fees payable to  LLP and their associates in respect of associated pension schemes Audit Other services Total fees payable to  LLP and their associates 4.1 4.2 All fees payable to  LLP, the Companys auditors, include amounts in respect of expenses.
All fees payable to  LLP have been charged to the income statement except for those in relation to associated pension schemes, which are borne by the respective schemes, and fees amounting to nil 20060.1 million which have been capitalised as they relate to the Groups assessment of its acquisitions and are therefore a directly attributable acquisition expense.
Financial Statements 84 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 3 Operating profit continued b Restructuring and impairment charges 2007 2006 Other Other Restructuring impairments Total Restructuring impairments Total m m m m m m Restructuring and impairment charges Goodwill impairment 11 11 Tangible fixed asset impairments reversals 72 9 1 1 Other asset write-downs 1 1 1 1 62 8 2 11 13 Redundancy costs including post-employment curtailments 16 16 35 35 Other reorganisation costs including property surplus 23 23 26 26 33 2 31 63 11 74 Restructuring During 2007 the Group continued to deploy its strategic restructuring programme, first announced in March 2004, that involves the migration of Driveline production capacity from high cost to low cost high growth economies, actions in support of the recovery in Powder Metallurgy and the realignment and reduction of production capacity, overhead and infrastructure costs in other areas of the business.
Charges recognised in the year in respect of this programme amount to 33 million 200663 million which comprises amounts in respect of asset impairments of 6 million credit 20062 million charge, redundancy costs, including pension past service charges, credits and curtailments of 16 million 200635 million and other reorganisation costs of 23 million 200626 million.
Pension past service charges, credits and curtailments amount to a 4 million charge in 2007 20063 million.
An analysis by segment and description of the charges is set out below: 2007 2006 Impairments Redundancy Reorganisation Total Total m m m m m Driveline 5 14 10 19 37 Powder Metallurgy 1 2 13 14 24 Corporate 2 6 16 23 33 63 Redundancy costs provided for represent charges for contractual severance and other employee related exit benefits and post-employment augmentations and curtailments.
Reorganisation costs include charges for onerous lease, property and other contracts, incremental costs borne by the Group as a consequence of dedicated restructuring and transition teams and equipment relocation costs attributable to the transfer of equipment between closing facilities and continuing operations and incremental premium freight and product homologation costs.
The impairment reversal in Powder Metallurgy arises from the redeployment of previously impaired plant into cash generative alternative use elsewhere in the relevant division.
In Driveline the net impairment relates to the write-downs for plant deemed to be irrecoverable via future use 3 million being offset by a reversal 8 million in a specific cash generating unit where business recovery has been sufficient to support reinstatement of the asset.
Restructuring actions undertaken in the year included the closure of a North American Powder Metallurgy production facility, the continuation of the strategic fixed headcount reduction programme in Driveline and the ongoing reductions in operations in Driveline plants and four Powder Metallurgy facilities.
A net 2 million surplus has arisen on the disposal of a UK Powder Metallurgy facility that became surplus to operational requirements as a consequence of the restructuring.
In 2006 restructuring charges arose primarily in respect of the announced closure and or downsizings of four Driveline facilities, Driveline strategic fixed headcount reductions and the announced closure of three Powder Metallurgy manufacturing facilities.
Cash outflow in respect of 2007 and earlier periods strategic restructuring actions amounted to 44 million 200657 million.
The disposal of the surplus property noted above generated a net 4 million cash inflow.
Other impairments The 2 million impairment reversal recognised in 2007 arose in relation to the Groups UK cylinder liner manufacturing operation.
The business disposed of land and buildings and plant and machinery at a value greater than the theoretical net book value of the assets had they not been impaired, consequently, a proportion of the previously recognised impairment has been reversed.
The 2006 full year goodwill impairment arose in Driveline.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 85 c Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on business combinations the Group identifies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include operating intangibles, predominantly computer software, and non-operating intangibles being the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over the expected useful economic lives.
Details of the lives used are set out in the Groups accounting policies and note 10 to these financial statements.
The amortisation of non-operating intangible assets is separately identified as a component of operating profit on the face of the income statement.
The analysis below sets out the amortisation charge in the year by category of non-operating intangible asset.
2007 2006 m m Brands trademarks Proprietary technology rights and know-how 2 1 Other intellectual property rights 1 1 Customer contracts and relationships and agreements not to compete 5 1 8 3 d Profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses 2007 2006 Restated m m Profits and losses on closure of businesses: Trading losses of the UK cylinder liner manufacturing operation 7 9 Profits and losses on sale of businesses: Fujiwa China 5 7 4 On 2 March 2006 final approval was received from the Taiwanese authorities to transfer the Groups 60% shareholding in Fujiwa to its business partner, Lioho Corporation.
At this point the Groups control of and active participation in the Fujiwa business ceased.
The net cash inflow arising on disposal is set out below: 2006 m Net assets disposed 19 Minority interests 8 Cumulative translation adjustment 1 Surplus arising on disposal 5 Consideration receivable net of attributable expenses 15 In the period from 1 January 2006 to disposal Fujiwa contributed 5 million to Group sales, 1 million to Group trading profit and nil to cash generated from operations.
e Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be valued at the balance sheet date and any difference between that value and the intrinsic value of the instrument to be reflected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Any subsequent change in value is reflected in the income statement unless hedge accounting is achieved.
Such movements do not affect cash flow or the economic substance of the underlying transaction.
In 2007 and 2006 the Group used transactional hedge accounting in a limited number of instances.
As a consequence, and to assist year on year comparison, the change in value continues to be identified as a separate element of operating profit.
Details of the charges and credits to 2007 operating profit are set out in note 20.
Financial Statements 86 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 4 Net financing costs 2007 2006 m m Interest payable and fee expense: Short term bank and other borrowings 7 3 Loans repayable within five years 29 5 Loans repayable after five years 25 48 Finance leases 1 1 62 57 Interest receivable: Short term investments, loans and deposits 19 23 19 23 Other net financing charges: Expected return on pension scheme assets 146 136 Interest on post-employment obligations 149 140 3 4 Net financing costs 46 38 5 Taxation 2007 2006 Analysis of charge in year m m Current tax: Current year 38 38 Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses and other assets 9 2 Adjustments in respect of prior years 3 3 Net movement on provisions for uncertain tax positions 4 15 36 18 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of temporary differences excluding post-employment obligations 12 15 Tax in respect of post-employment obligations 3 6 Tax on change in fair value of derivative financial instruments 2 Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses and other assets 7 7 Other changes in unrecognised deferred tax assets 28 21 Changes in tax rates 8 Adjustments in respect of prior years 1 4 35 13 Total tax charge for the year 1 5 Overseas tax included above 18 15 Tax in respect of restructuring and impairment charges included in total charge for the year Current tax 7 6 Deferred tax 2 8 5 14 The Group is required to estimate the income tax due in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantively enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement, are based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 87 The Group is subject to many different tax jurisdictions and tax rules as a consequence of its geographic spread.
It is therefore subject to tax audits and tax reviews, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Management judgement is therefore required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts set aside and released in any period are based on management judgement and interpretation of country specific tax law and the likelihood of crystallisation and settlement.
Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
However, as amounts set aside in any period could differ from actual tax liabilities incurred, adjustments are required in subsequent periods which may have a material impact on the Groups income statement and or cash tax payment.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period comprise payments on account and payments on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities and, as a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and tax cash payments.
Interest on provisions for uncertain tax positions is, where relevant, provided for in the tax charge.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this and the tax charge are given in the business review on page 15.

Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options.
The calculation is performed for the share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market share price of the Company's shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
Earnings per share are computed as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted average number Earnings per average number Earnings per Earnings of shares share Earnings of shares share m m p m m p Total Company Basic eps: Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 196 703.4 27.9 177 708.8 25.0 Dilutive securities: Dilutive potential ordinary shares 2.9 0.1 2.1 0.1 Diluted eps 196 706.3 27.8 177 710.9 24.9 Adjusted earnings per share total Company Earnings per share before restructuring and impairment charges, amortisation of non-operating intangibles arising on business combinations, profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses and the changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments, which the Directors consider gives a useful additional indicator of underlying performance, is calculated on earnings for the year adjusted as follows: 2007 2006 restated mp mp Profit attributable to equity shareholders 196 27.9 177 25.0 Charges credits included in operating profit: Restructuring and impairment charges 31 4.4 74 10.5 Amortisation of non-operating intangibles on business combinations 8 1.1 3 0.4 Profits and losses on sale or closures of businesses 7 1.0 4 0.6 Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments 10 1.4 33 4.7 Taxation on charges credits included in operating profit 5 0.7 12 1.7 Adjusted earnings attributable to equity shareholders 247 35.1 213 30.1 Diluted adjusted earnings per share attributable to equity shareholders 35.0 30.0 7 Dividends 2007 2006 m m Equity dividends paid in the year Previous year final: 8.7p 2006 8.2p per share 61 59 Current year interim: 4.3p 2006 4.1p per share 30 29 In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2007 of 9.2p per share, at a cost of 65 million.

Details of the Directors short term variable remuneration schemes are set out in the remuneration report.
Other members of key management participate in schemes based on the achievement of profit and cash targets and which are payable in cash.
The amount outstanding at 31 December 2007 in respect of annual short term variable remuneration was 3 million 20062 million.
Post-employment benefits represent the charge to trading profit under IAS 19 attributable to key management arising in the year and the attributable cost of post-employment medical benefits.
Termination benefits include redundancy, pension augmentations and ex gratia payments arising in connection with loss of office and termination of employment with the Group.
Share-based payments represents the annual charge attributable to key management in respect of their participation in the Groups share-based remuneration arrangements: details of the nature of these arrangements are set out in note 9 and in the Directors remuneration report.

Financial Statements 90 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Share-based payments The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes.
Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard, awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo model which uses the same principle as a binomial model.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are: a Employee Sharesave Scheme In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme the terms of which were that the employee entered into a regular savings commitment up to a maximum of 250 per month for a three year period.
The cumulative savings were then used to acquire options over a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant.
There were no performance conditions but, in general, the employee must remain in employment for the three year period.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected dividend yield 4.3%, risk-free interest rate 4.49% and a term of 3.25 years.
There have been no further awards since September 2003. b Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2005 and April 2006 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2007 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share EPS growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 163p to 380.3p, volatility 31% to 38%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.28% to 5.40% and expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years.
c Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2006 and April 2007 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes, options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group.
There is no retest facility under either scheme.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility 23% to 39%, expected dividend yield 3.3% to 6.2%, risk-free interest rate 4.05% to 5.40% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
d Bonus Co-Investment Plan BCIP Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees excluding Directors were entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short term annual bonus potential to purchase shares in the Company at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained for that period the Company matches those shares.
For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was two and a half for one.
In addition, in 2005 there was a further one for one match if certain profit targets are achieved.
All shares under the scheme are purchased in the open market.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to 5.4%, risk-free interest rate, where applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
e Profit Growth Incentive Plan PGIP Awards were made in April 2007 under the PGIP to certain senior employees excluding Directors.
Any benefit under the PGIP will be deliverable dependent upon the extent to which profit growth targets are satisfied by the Group over a three year performance period: the Groups reported profit for the year prior to the year of award forms the baseline for this performance measure.
The PGIP is a cash-based incentive plan.
However, for certain very senior employees the benefit is deliverable in shares: the number of shares given below will be released following the performance period if the minimum targeted profit growth is achieved.
A maximum of twice the amount of shares listed below will be released on achievement of the maximum profit target, with one and a half times the number being released for interim performance.
No shares will be released and the awards will lapse if the minimum profit target is not achieved.
Release is also conditional upon the satisfaction of a personal shareholding requirement.
Any awards deliverable under the PGIP will be satisfied from GKN ordinary shares already in issue.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards.
The risk-free interest rate is the rate obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
Further details of the ESOS, LTIP, BCIP and PGIP schemes are given in the Directors remuneration report on pages 57 to 68.
The total charge for the year relating to share-based payment plans was 6 million 20065 million, all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 6 million 20065 million.
Liabilities in respect of share-based payments were not material at either 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
There were no vested rights to cash or other assets at either 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.

Intangible assets acquired in relation to production order backlog are included within customer contracts and relationships.
No individual Other intangible asset is material to the Group.
Computer software under finance leases amounts to 2 million 20061 million.
All non-operating intangibles are recognised when they are controlled through contractual or other legal rights or are separable from the remainder of the business and other tangible assets and their fair value can be reliably measured.
Details of the intangible assets considered and arising on the current year business combinations are set out in note 25 to these financial statements.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 93 Impairment An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
The only amount of goodwill allocated to an individual CGU which is significant to the total Group goodwill is that attributable to a US Aerospace business of 67 million 200668 million.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use except for current year acquisitions where market values have been used.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used in the majority of impairment tests except where a longer term more detailed forecast is available and appropriate.
These forecasts are based on approved annual budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
A number of key assumptions have been made as a basis for the impairment tests.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information and these are set out below.
Where a reasonably possible change to an assumption would lead to an impairment, a sensitivity analysis has been provided which quantifies the amount of change required for an impairment to result.
Discount rates A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to discount rates to reflect the risk inherent in specific CGUs.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
Except for operations in India, where a rate of 16.0% has been factored into impairment models, the risk adjusted pre-tax discount range of rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reflects the mix of currencies within CGUs within the segments.
Driveline: 8.25%13.0% Powder Metallurgy: 9.75%12.25% OffHighway: 11.0%12.25% Aerospace: 9.75%11.50% Long term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a long term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published Oxford Economic Forecast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of real growth rates from 2.1% 2006 2.4% for Japan to 7.7% 2006 7.9% for India, with most other countries between 2.0% and 4.0% in both years.
Nominal growth rates used in the calculations ranged from 2.7% to 13.4%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis In order to gauge sensitivity to likely and potential changes in discount rates and long term growth rates the impact of a 1% increase and or decrease in each rate in isolation was reviewed.
In no instance does such a change result in an impairment in segmental goodwill balances.
Financial Statements 94 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 10 Intangible assets continued Driveline In determining the recoverable amount of Driveline CGUs, it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash flows.
The main assumptions include discount rates, long term growth rates, future sales prices and volumes with reference to specific customer relationships and product lines, a realistic estimate of new business, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benefits from annual productivity improvements.
Assumptions have also been made regarding input costs, including steel prices.
It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report.
Aerospace In addition to the discount rate and long term growth rate, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of Aerospace CGUs were specific volumes on certain US military and civil programmes, the achievement of forecast selling prices, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned productivity improvements.
Other segments For the remaining impairment tests, key assumptions related to sales volumes and prices, raw material input costs and achieving benefits from annual productivity improvements.

Bonds included within other borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market value.
19 Financial risk management The Groups activities give rise to a number of financial risks: market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Market risk includes foreign exchange risk, cash flow and fair value interest rate risk and commodity price risk.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance.
Derivative financial instruments, mainly forward foreign exchange contracts, are used to hedge risk exposure that arise in the ordinary course of business.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identification of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, financial credit risk and liquidity risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
These disclosures should be read in conjunction with the financing and risk commentary in the business review on pages 36 to 39. a Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
These exposures are forecast on a quarterly basis by operating companies and are reported to the central Treasury Department.
Under the Groups foreign exchange policy, such exposures are hedged on a reducing percentage basis over a number of forecast time horizons.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures for major currencies US dollar, euro and yen by hedging 70% to 90% of the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
The main impact of foreign exchange risk on the Groups results arises from the translation into sterling of the results of operations outside of the UK.
The Group's largest exposures are the euro and the US dollar where a 1% movement in the average rate impacts trading profit of subsidiaries and joint ventures by 1.6 million and 0.7 million respectively.
Regarding financial instruments, the main operating profit changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments exposure arises from changes in the US dollar and euro for derivative financial instruments held at fair value through profit and loss and the main exposure on equity arises from changes in the euro, US dollar and yen for derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 99 A 1% strengthening of sterling against the currency rates indicated would have the following impact: 2007 2006 m m Income statement: US dollar 3 4 Euro Equity: Euro 3 3 US dollar 3 3 Yen 1 1 The sensitivity analysis has been prepared by reperforming the calculations used to determine the balance sheet values adjusted for the changes in the individual currency rates indicated with all other cross currency rates remaining constant.

The Groups policy is to optimise interest cost in reported earnings and reduce volatility in the debt related element of the Groups cost of capital.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of fixed and floating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a defined time horizon.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
However, this policy was suspended in December 2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of floating rate bank debt following the receipt of the sale proceeds of GKNs share in AgustaWestland.
At 31 December 2007 89% 2006 91% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to fixed interest rates.
As at 31 December 2007 147 million 2006188 million was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds, of which 145 million 2006 163 million was on deposit in the UK.
A 1% change in interest rates would have a 1 million impact on net interest.
This sensitivity impact has been prepared by determining average floating interest rates and flexing these against average floating rate deposits and borrowings by major currency area over the course of the year.
c Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
In terms of substance, and consistent with the related balance sheet presentation, the Group considers it has two types of credit risk: operational and financial.
Operational credit risk relates to non-performance by customers in respect of trade receivables and by suppliers in respect of other receivables.
Financial credit risk relates to non-performance by banks and similar institutions in respect of cash and deposits and financial contracts, including forward foreign currency contracts.
Operational As tier one suppliers to automotive, off-highway and aerospace original equipment manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
The credit profiles of such original equipment manufacturers are available from credit rating agencies.
The failure of any such customer to honour its debts could materially impact the Groups results.
However, there are many advantages in these relationships.
In certain parts of the Group, mainly Industrial Distribution Services within Driveline and OffHighway there are a greater proportion of amounts receivable from small and medium sized customers.
Credit risk and customer relationships are managed at a number of levels within the Group.
At a subsidiary level documented credit control reviews are required to be held at least every month.
The scope of these reviews includes amounts overdue and credit limits.
At a divisional level debtor ratios, overdue accounts and overall performance is reviewed regularly.
Provisions for doubtful debts are determined at these levels based upon the customer's ability to pay and other factors in the Group's relationship with the customer.
As at 31 December 2007 41% 2006 44% of trade receivables arose from 10 customers.
Financial Statements 100 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19 Financial risk management continued The amount of trade receivables outstanding at the year end does not represent the maximum exposure to operational credit risk due to the normal patterns of supply and payment over the course of a year.
Based on management information collected as at month ends the maximum level of trade receivables at any one point during the year was 650 million 2006611 million.
Financial Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long term credit rating, normally at least AA or equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 25 million 200640 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign currency contracts at 31 December 2007 to a single bank was 3 million 20066 million.
The amounts on deposit at year end represent the Groups maximum exposure to financial credit risk with Group indebtedness varying over the course of a year in line with normal financing and trading patterns.
d Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure which optimises the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce borrowings.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the ratio of Gross borrowings to EBITDA.
The Group seeks to operate at an EBITDA to Gross borrowings ratio of 2.5 times or less and the ratios at 31 December 2007 and 2006 were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Gross borrowings 788 768 EBITDA 428 396 Gross borrowings to EBITDA ratio 1.8 times 1.9 times e Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk as part of its normal financing and trading cycle at times when peak borrowings are required.
Borrowings normally peak in May and September following dividend and bond coupon payments.
The Groups policies are to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet obligations when they fall due and to maintain sufficient flexibility in order to fund investment and acquisition objectives.
Liquidity needs are assessed through short and long term forecasts.
Committed bank facilities of 350 million expire in July 2010 and were undrawn at the year end 2006 350 million expiring in July 2010 and undrawn at the year end.
Committed facilities are provided through ten banks.

Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 101 f Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices, particularly of metals, which has a significant impact on input costs and the overall financial results.
The Group seeks to mitigate this exposure in a variety of ways including medium term price agreements, surcharges and advance purchasing.
In rare circumstances and only in respect of certain specified risks, the Group uses derivative commodity hedging instruments.
The impact of such financial instruments in respect of the overall commodity price risk is not material.

Amounts are only set aside when irrevocable commitments exist at the balance sheet date and these invariably reflect actual or constructive contractual arrangements which indicate the amount and most likely timing of flows.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to amounts provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specific provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
In the event of a claim, settlement will be negotiated with the customer based on supply of replacement products and compensation for the customers associated costs.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimate of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Legal and environmental Legal provisions amounting to 5 million 20068 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business.
Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities, a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts charged and carried reflect the current best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.
Other Other provisions include amounts set aside in terms of insurance provisions held within the Group's captive insurance company 8 million 2006 10 million, provisions held in respect of onerous loss making contracts 11 million 20069 million, and long service non-pension and other employee related obligations arising primarily in the Groups continental European subsidiaries 15 million 200612 million.
Insurance provisions and charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice.
The onerous loss making contract provisions relate to specific noncancellable contractual commitments where it is anticipated that unavoidable net operating losses will arise.

Deferred tax assets totalling 35 million 200682 million have been recognised relating to territories where tax losses have been incurred in the year.
It is anticipated that future profitability arising from restructuring and other actions will result in their realisation.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries except where the distribution of such profits is planned.
If the earnings were remitted in full, tax of 25 million 200625 million would be payable.
The UK Government announced the gradual abolition of industrial building allowances in the 2007 Budget.
Since this change had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, its effect is not included in the calculation of deferred tax as at 31 December 2007.
The impact of this change on the Groups future tax rate is anticipated to be insignificant.

Financial Statements 106 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 25 Acquisitions 2007 Acquisitions On 29 June 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of the Teleflex Aerospace Manufacturing Group TAMG of Teleflex Inc, in a mixed trade and asset and legal entity deal, for a fair value consideration of 68 million.
The businesses acquired provide manufacturing and engineering services from operations in the US, Mexico, France and the UK.
The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
Fair values on the acquisition remain provisional as the review of acquired operations and assets remains ongoing.
Carrying values Fair value Fair pre-acquisition adjustments values m m m Intangible fixed assets 21 21 Property, plant and equipment 14 5 19 Inventories 12 1 11 Trade and other receivables 15 15 Trade and other payables 10 1 11 Provisions post-employment obligations other 9 9 Deferred tax liabilities 2 6 8 Cash and cash equivalents 29 9 38 Goodwill 30 Total fair value of consideration 68 Consideration satisfied by: Cash 67 Directly attributable costs 1 68 Valuation of non-operating intangibles methodology The fair value exercise carried out in conjunction with a third party expert on the acquisition of TAMG considered the existence of the following recognisable intangibles attributable to the business: in-process research & development IPRD, non-compete covenants, marketing agreements, distributor relationships, trade names, leasehold interests, software, proprietary technology and customer relationships contracts.
No significant IPRD or marketing agreements were identified and accordingly no fair value was ascribed.
TAMG transacts most of its business directly with aerospace prime engine manufacturers, any revenue applicable to distributors is included within the customer relationship calculation.
No trade names were acquired in the transaction.
As part of the transaction the vendor covenanted not to compete on the products and processes of the business acquired for a period of three years.
Although the vendor still operates in the aerospace business it has retained no activities of a similar nature to those it disposed of.
The costs of recreating the specific technology and processes it disposed of would be significant.
A fair value of 1 million was identified for the covenant not to compete.
TAMG is a recognised market leader in the manufacture of complex engine components for the aerospace industry, thus giving the Group further positions on a range of established engine programmes.
The business has a range of both cold section products that are complementary to the Groups existing engine case and fan blade activities and hot section core activities in blisks, compressor airfoils and guide vanes.
TAMG has manufacturing and technological expertise in electrochemical machining ECM, forging, multi axis milling and conventional milling.
These capabilities are based on developed ECM proprietary technology and milling know-how.
The proprietary technology and know-how has been valued using a relief from royalty methodology.
The cash flow forecasts supporting this valuation reflect the future sales to be generated in conjunction with the technology.
The fair value attributed to proprietary technology represents the theoretical costs avoided by TAMG from not having to pay a licence fee for the technology.
The royalty rate used in the valuation was 3.0% for ECM and 2.0% for milling, which was based on a review of licence agreements for comparable technologies in similar industrial segments.
An after tax discount rate of 12.0% was applied to the forecast cash flows, a rate that reflects the higher inherent risk of intangible cash flows compared to the weighted average cost of capital of the TAMG acquisition.
Annual Report 2007 GKN plc 107 The intangible assets inherent in TAMGs customer relationships contracts were valued using an excess earnings method.
This methodology places a value on the intangible as a function of a managements estimate of the attrition rate on the expected cash flows arising from the contracts and forecast cash flows likely to accrue to TAMG from its customer base: b expected cash flows arising from the intangibles: c discount rate reflective of the risks inherent in the flows: and d an asset charge attributable to operating assets needed to generate the cash flows.
The cash flows attributable to customer relationships include an annual attrition rate of 5.0% to reflect expected decay in future revenues.
An after tax discount rate of 14.0% was applied to the forecast cash flows.
TAMGs primary operations and centre of management are based in the US.
The valuation of all intangibles reflects the tax benefit of amortisation, which in the context of TAMG has meant a benefit assessed with reference to US tax laws.
According to US tax law an intangible may be rateably amortised over 15 years regardless of its actual useful life, as such, there is a tax benefit to an acquirer and hence values attributable to the intangible assets have been recognised.
This value amounts to 3 million across all the intangibles recognised.
The fair value of customer relationships contracts recognised was 13 million and the fair value of ECM and milling know-how was 7 million.
Fair value adjustments on tangible fixed assets represent a net uplift on plant and equipment to fair values following an external third party appraisal.
The uplift primarily represents the restoration of asset values fully depreciated by TAMG.
TAMG operates from owned and leased facilities.
At leased facilities the rentals are reflective of current market values and hence no fair value is attributable to TAMGs interest in these leases.
Inventories acquired were assessed for scrap and obsolete items before being fair valued.
Inventories acquired have been fair valued at current replacement cost for raw materials and selling price, adjusted for costs of disposal and a selling margin, for finished goods and work-in-progress.
The value of the fair value inventory uplift was 1 million, the adjustment for scrap and obsolete items was 2 million.
Provisions includes amounts in respect of onerous contracts.
Three contracts with two customers have been identified where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under long term agreements exceeds the economic inflow they generate.
In assessing these contracts dedicated fixed assets have been impaired upon acquisition.
Two of the contracts identified are at an early stage and reflect the impact of contractually committed price downs.
Unavoidable costs include direct labour and material and a reasonable proportion of manufacturing overhead.
Also included are the unavoidable costs of purchasing fixed assets dedicated to these contracts and required as future volumes increase.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of TAMG is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with the Groups existing US Engine Products business, the value of the embedded workforce, the value of a significant manufacturer in the US engine component market and the ownership and control of a leading business in an industry with substantial barriers to entry.
TAMG contributed 38 million to sales and 4 million to the Groups trading profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of TAMG had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have increased by 72 million and Group trading profit would have increased by 6 million.
TAMG was acquired debt and cash free.
In the post-acquisition period TAMG contributed 4 million to cash generated from operations and absorbed 1 million in investing activities.
Prior year acquisitions Finalisation of fair value adjustments in respect of the 2006 acquisitions of Stellex Aerostructures, Rockford Powertrain and Liuzhou Steel Rim Factory Liuzhou were made in the year.

A number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benefits.
Pensions In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded defined benefit scheme.
In the USA and the Rest of the World there are a number of externally funded defined benefit schemes while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for postemployment obligations.
a Defined benefit schemes measurement and assumptions Independent actuarial valuations of all major defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2007.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Key assumptions were: UK Americas Europe ROW % % % % 2007 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 3.5 2.50 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.4 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 5.9 6.4 5.60 2.3 Inflation assumption 3.3 2.5 1.75 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long term 8.0 4.5 9.0 5.0 n a n a 2006 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.1 3.5 2.50 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 5.1 5.9 4.70 2.5 Inflation assumption 3.1 2.5 1.75 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long term 8.0 4.5 10.0 5.0 n a n a The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows: United Kingdom Such is the size and profile of the UK scheme that data on the schemes mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually.
At the recent annual review the age adjustment to PA92 year of birth was strengthened by 0.5 to 2.5 years to reflect actual scheme experience.
Mortality assumptions were strengthened further by moving to medium cohort projections.
The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme are that a male aged 65 lives for a further 19.8 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 21 years after retiring at 65.
The impact of this change in assumptions has increased liabilities by 75 million.
Overseas In the USA, CL2007 tables were adopted in 2007 whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables were again used.
In the USA the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 18.8 years whilst in Germany for a further 17.7 years.
The longevity assumption for a US male currently aged 40 is that he also lives for a further 18.8 years once attaining 65 years, with the German equivalent assumption being 17.7 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.
Financial Statements 110 GKN plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27 Post-employment obligations continued Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions on the defined benefit net obligations as at 31 December 2007 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW m m m m Discount rate 1% 282 32 31 3 Discount rate -1% 346 40 39 3 Rate of inflation 1% 200 25 Rate of inflation -1% 180 22 Rate of increase in medical costs 1% 1 1 n a n a Rate of increase in medical costs -1% 11 n a n a A one percentage point increase in the assumption on healthcare benefits would increase the total service and interest cost by nil 2006 1 million and the liability by 2 million 2006 11 million.
