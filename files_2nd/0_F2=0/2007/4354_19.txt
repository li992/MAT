The presentation above has been restated to show goodwill brought forward at the IFRS transition date net of amortisation at deemed cost as required by IFRS 1.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indicators that goodwill might be impaired.
The impairment recognised for the year was 36.1 million.
Of the impairment for the year, 10.2 million relates to the national newspaper division for Loot following continued decreases in advertising and circulation revenues and 1.1 million for Simply Switch due to poor trading, 5.2 million to the local media division in relation to a classified paid-for newspaper and 19.6 million relating to the exhibition division in relation to consumer shows in the USA.
In addition to the impairment of 36.1 million, a reduction in cost of 4.4 million has been recorded upon recognition of deferred tax assets relating to pre-acquisition losses.
In the prior period, of the total impairment charge of 35.1 million, 15.4 million relates to the exhibition division following a downturn in the consumer and gift markets it serves and 19.2 million relates to the national newspaper division as a result of decreases in advertising and circulation revenues at Loot.
When testing for impairment, the recoverable amounts for all the Groups cash-generating units CGUs are measured at their value in use by discounting future expected cash flows.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on management approved budgets and projections which reflect managements current experience and future expectations of the markets in which the CGU operates.
Risk adjusted discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 8.4% to 15.0%, the choice of rates depending on the market and maturity of the CGU: the growth rates used in the projections range between 3.0% and 5.0% and vary with managements view of the CGUs market position, maturity of the relevant market, and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which it operates.
Goodwill arising on the acquisitions is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability relating to the distribution of the Groups products in new and existing markets and anticipated operating synergies from the business combinations.
The only large single item of goodwill included in the net book value above relates to BCA, a business within Metal Bulletin, which has a carrying value of 113.5 million.
The Group reviews the appropriateness of the carrying value of its intangible assets and tests intangible fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators that intangible fixed assets might be impaired.
The impairment recognised for the year was 12.2 million 2006 24.1 million.
Of the charge for the year 11.9 million relates to Simply Switch in the national newspaper division following poor trading.
The Group is satisfied that the carrying value at 30th September, 2007 remains recoverable in full.
Risk adjusted discount rates used by the Group in its impairment tests range from 8.4% to 15.0%, the choice of rates depending on the market and maturity of the CGU: the growth rates used in the projections range between 3% and 5% and vary with managements view of the CGUs market position, maturity of the relevant market, and do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the market in which it operates.

The loan notes are repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six month notice period and are treated as a current liability.
The interest rates charged on the Groups bank loans are based on LIBOR plus a margin and ranged as follows: 2007 2007 2006 2006 High Low High Low %% %% Sterling 7.30 4.23 5.61 4.72 US dollar 6.23 5.32 5.86 4.07 Australian dollar 6.54 5.75 Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 105 continued 31 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED The Groups bonds have been adjusted from their nominal values to take account of premia, direct issue costs and discounts.
The issue costs, premia and discounts are amortised over the expected lives of the bonds using the effective interest method.
The unamortised issue costs amount to 3.7 million 2006 3.2 million and the unamortised premia amounts to 16.2 million 2006 19.4 million.
A proportion of the Groups bonds are hedged using fixed to floating swaps.
Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the income statement.
During the year the Group redeemed 9.4 million of its existing 2021 bonds at a cost of 12.6 million and issued a new 20-year 200 million 6.375% bond receiving proceeds amounting to 197.8 million after costs of 2.2 million were deducted.
In the prior year the Group had a US$ interest rate swap outstanding amounting to a principal of US$10.0 million with the Group paying a fixed rate of 5.00%.
The Group also had outstanding cross currency, fixed to fixed, interest rate swaps.
These amounted to 255.5 million US$485 million 2006 239.6 million US$430.1 million resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 4.40% and 6.07% 2006 2.62% and 5.34%, 18.8 million Aus$45.0 million 2006 41.8 million Aus$100.0 million with the Group paying fixed Australian dollar interest at rates of between 6.15% and 6.22% 2006 5.66% and 6.44%.
In the prior year the Group also had outstanding 23.4 billion 127.8 million with the Group paying fixed Japanese Yen interest of JPY 0.90%.
The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps.
These amounted to US$130.0 million notional 2006 US$60.0 million at rates of between 4.00% and 6.00% 2006 4.00% and 6.00%.
The Groups cross currency swaps and forward contracts are treated as net investment hedges, hedging the Groups overseas investments and the swaps are all treated as fair value hedges.
The effect of these derivatives on the Groups interest rate exposure on bonds and bank debt is as follows: Including the effect Excluding the effect of financial instruments of financial instruments 2007 2006 2007 2006 %%%% Sterling bank loans 5.83 4.79 5.83 4.79 US dollar bank loans 5.70 5.30 5.70 5.30 Australian dollar bank loans 6.02 6.02 Bonds 6.78 6.83 7.33 7.67 Market risk The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and forward foreign exchange contracts set out below represent the replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 30th September, 2007.
The fair value of long-term borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates for disclosures purposes only.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes in interest rates.
This is achieved by issuing fixed rate sterling bond debt and through interest rate hedges described above.
The tables on the preceding pages provide an analysis of the Groups exposure to fixed and floating rate debt.
The Groups exposure to cash flow risk is considered low in comparison to the Groups total interest rate risk.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 106 continued 31 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED The carrying and fair values of the Groups financial instruments are set out in the table below: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair value value value value m m m m Trade and other receivables 434.3 434.3 367.6 367.6 Cash and cash equivalents 70.4 70.4 97.3 97.3 Trade and other payables 621.7 621.7 526.7 526.7 Short-term borrowings 43.2 43.2 12.3 12.3 Long-term borrowings 982.7 1,028.6 832.0 905.1 Interest rate swaps swapping fixed rate debt to floating 5.8 5.8 2.3 2.3 Interest rate caps 0.8 0.8 Fixed to fixed cross currency swaps 10.3 10.3 33.6 33.6 Forward foreign exchange contracts 4.7 4.7 Short-term borrowings comprise bank loans, overdrafts, finance lease and deferred consideration.
Long-term borrowings comprise bank loans, bonds and deferred consideration.
Foreign exchange rate risk Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in countries with currencies other than those of each of the parent companies, most particularly in respect of the US businesses.
The net asset exposures are hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
Credit risk The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks described above by the use of financial instruments and as a result has a credit risk from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to these financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risks are controlled by monitoring the credit quality of these counterparties, principally licensed commercial banks and investment banks with strong long-term credit ratings, and of the amounts outstanding with each of them.
The Group has treasury policies in place which do not allow concentrations of risk with individual counterparties and do not allow significant treasury exposures with counterparties which are rated lower than AA by Standard and Poors, Moodys or Fitch.
There is no concentration of debtors in the Group.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows: 2007 2006 m m Trade and other receivables 360.9 324.5 Bank deposits 70.4 97.3 Derivative financial instruments 30.5 39.3 Expiring in more than one year Trade and other receivables 4.0 4.1 465.8 465.2 Liquidity risk The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements after taking into account the Groups holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist.
It is believed that these facilities together with the Groups bond issuances will be sufficient to cover the likely shortand long-term cash requirements of the Group.
Associates, joint ventures and other investments will in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements.
In most cases such financing will be non-recourse to DMGT plc.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 107 continued 31 FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CONTINUED Committed borrowing facilities The Groups borrowing facilities, which are unsecured, bear interest charged at LIBOR plus a margin based on the Groups ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Additionally each facility contains a covenant based on a minimum interest cover ratio.
The following undrawn committed borrowing facilities were available to the Group as at 30th September, 2007 and at 1st October, 2006, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met: 2007 2006 m m Expiring in less than one year 120.0 Expiring in less than one year Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 260.0 Expiring in more than two years 119.5 115.2 239.5 375.2 Fair value hedges The Groups policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate borrowings due to interest rate movements which could affect the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives with a principal amount of 75.0 million 2006 75.0 million were in place at 30th September, 2007 swapping fixed rate sterling debt into floating rate sterling debt.
The gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges included in the income statement for the year ended 30th September, 2007 were: Fair value 1st October, movement 30th September, 2006 gain loss 2007 m m m Sterling interest rate swaps 2.3 3.0 5.3 Sterling debt 2.3 3.0 5.3 Total Cash flow hedges The Group enters into two types of cash flow hedge: fixed to fixed cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange derivatives which fix the exchange rate on a portion of future currency expenditure.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30th September, 2007.
Net investment hedges The Group enters into forward currency sales and cross currency swaps to hedge the Groups investment in foreign operations.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 30th September, 2007.
"Tax equalisation swaps The Group enters into forward currency sales purchases which hedge tax payable receivable when long-term intercompany non-trading balances are revalued ""Tax Equalisation Swaps""."

The schemes for most employees are funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on final pensionable salary.
In addition, a number of defined contribution pension plans are operated by certain divisions of the Group where this type of pension provision aligns with the business model.
The assets of all the schemes are held independently from the Groups finances and in the UK are administered by trustees or trustee companies.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 30th September, 2007 were 31.1 million 2006 34.4 million.
Aberdeen Journals The sale by the Group of Aberdeen Journals Limited on 2nd April, 2006 crystallised from a pensions viewpoint on 30th September, 2006 following a period of continued participation by employees of that company in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
The sale triggered payments totalling 25.9 million to these schemes to deal with the debts arising under Section 75 of the Pensions Act 2004.
The payment was received by the schemes on 9th February, 2007.
A number of the members involved agreed to transfer their accrued pension benefits to their new employers pension scheme, and an appropriate payment was made from the DMGT schemes in this respect.
Metal Bulletin The acquisition by Euromoney Institutional Investor plc of Metal Bulletin plc on 6th October, 2006 included a defined benefit obligation in respect of the Metal Bulletin Pension Scheme MBPS.
As a result of this acquisition, at that date the defined benefit obligation of the Group increased by 21.7 million and the fair value of pension scheme assets increased by 17.7 million resulting in an increase of the net pension liability of 4.0 million.
The impact of the acquisition of MBPS on the balance sheet disclosures, and the subsequent pension costs arising, are included in the figures reported below.
Defined Benefit Schemes Each of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are administered by a trustee company which is required to act in the best interest of the beneficiaries of that scheme.
The appointment of trustee directors is determined by the trust documentation of each scheme, and associated legislation, and requires the appointment of both Company and Member-nominated Directors MNDs.
The selection of MNDs has to date been in accordance with the opt-out arrangements put forward by the principal employer in July 1997, as permitted under The Occupational Pension Schemes Member-nominated Trustees and Directors Regulations 1996.
However, these arrangements expired in July 2007, and new legislation is in place.
Each trustee company is currently reviewing its procedures on the nomination and selection of MNDs and will communicate the new arrangements to members within the next few months.
The Group has informed the trustees of the two main schemes, The Mail Newspapers Pension Scheme and The Harmsworth Pension Scheme, of its intention to merge these schemes.
The trustees of both schemes have set up a sub-committee to consider the impact of the merger and, in particular, to ensure that the benefits and interests of all scheme members are protected.
There will be no change in the benefits provided to any members as a result of the merger.
It is expected that the merger will be completed by 30th November, 2007.
Full actuarial valuations are carried out triennially by the actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The figures in this note are based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the actuarial valuations of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2007, and adjusted to 30th September, 2007 by the actuary.
However, the results of the formal valuation of the schemes as at 31st March, 2007 are not expected to become available until early in 2008.
The company cash contribution rate to the main schemes during the year was 18% of pensionable salaries 2006 18%.
At 30th September, 2007, the defined benefit obligation to the Group relating to the DMGT AVC Plan was 56.6 million 2006 62.1 million.
The assets of the Plan were 66.8 million 2006 65.7 million, producing a surplus of 10.2 million 2006 3.6 million.
However, as indicated in the disclosures below, an adjustment has been made to cap the value of assets in the Plan since the surplus is not recoverable by the Group.
Thus, the net value of the Plan in the Group balance sheet is nil 2006 nil.
The Plan is closed to further member contributions.
The Plan has had no impact on the pension cost reported in these financial statements.
The main schemes have a two-tiered benefit structure represented by a Standard section and a Pension section.
In the Standard section, employees pay contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries and have benefits based on a normal retirement age of 65.
Under the Pension section, employees currently pay contributions of 7.5% and enjoy a higher benefit accrual rate and lower normal retirement age than in the Standard section.
The schemes remain open to eligible new employees who, after one years service, can join the Standard section with an option to join the Pension section after a further four years service.
Members are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the Group from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the scheme assets reported below.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 110 continued 32 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED A reconciliation of the net pension obligation reported in the balance sheet is shown in the following table: 2007 2007 2007 2006 schemes schemes Total schemes in surplus in deficit m in deficit Present value of defined benefit obligation 1,556.0 221.1 1,777.1 1,830.1 Assets at fair value 1,648.2 219.7 1,867.9 1,682.4 Impact of asset ceiling on AVC Plan 10.2 10.2 3.6 Surplus Deficit reported in the balance sheet 82.0 1.4 80.6 151.3 The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee, in its document IFRIC 14, has interpreted the extent to which a company can recognise a pension surplus on its balance sheet.
Having taken account of the rules of the schemes, the fact that the schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash contributions, the Company considers that recognition of the schemes surpluses on its balance sheet is in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14.
In 2006, all schemes were in deficit.
The surplus for the year, set out above, excludes a related deferred tax liability of 22.5 million 2006 asset 37.6 million.

The value of DMGT A Ordinary Non-Voting Shares held by the UK equity passive manager on behalf of the schemes at 30th September, 2007 was 0.7 million 2006 0.7 million.
The assumption for the expected overall rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected returns for each asset class based on the proportion of assets held in each class at the beginning of the year.
The expected return on bonds has been selected having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
The expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on plan assets was 198.2 million 2006 183.7 million representing the expected return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The main financial assumptions are shown in the following table: 2007 2006 % % Price inflation 3.30 2.90 Salary increases 4.60 4.40 Pension increases 3.30 2.90 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.90 5.00 Expected overall rate of return on assets 7.10 6.90 The discount rate for scheme liabilities reflects yields at the balance sheet date on high quality corporate bonds.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Recent improvements in longevity have lead to a review of mortality assumptions as a part of the actuarial valuation of the schemes as at 31st March, 2007.
As explained above, the results of this valuation are not expected until early 2008.
However, the Company has decided to revise the mortality assumptions taking account of scheme experience, medium cohort projections, and an allowance for future improvement in life expectancy.
At the same time, the Company has decided to make an allowance for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash.
Further review of these assumptions will be possible when the results of the formal valuation are known.

Included in scheme assets is an advance payment into the Groups pension schemes amounting to 25.1 million in respect of the 2007 contributions 2006 23.6 million.
UK defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension plans.
Currently, these are principally trust-based arrangements, with an aggregate value of 27.0 million 2006 26.0 million at the year end.
The growth of online businesses coupled with acquisitions is likely to mean that a higher portion of the Groups employees will be offered defined contribution arrangements in future and it is expected that these plans will progressively be amended to operate on a group personal pension basis, following approval of this approach by the Groups divisions.
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounted to 3.6 million 2006 5.2 million.
Overseas pension plans Overseas subsidiaries of certain Group divisions operate defined contribution retirement benefit plans, primarily in North America and Australia.
The pension cost attributable to these plans during the year amounts to 4.6 million 2006 2.4 million.
Pension arrangements for executives The Group operates a two-tier, contributory defined benefit pension scheme for senior executives including executive Directors, details of which are incorporated in the above disclosures.
It is the Groups policy that annual bonuses, payments under the Executive Bonus Scheme and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 113 continued 32 RETIREMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Included in UK defined contribution plans above are investments in a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for certain executives of the Group including two executive Directors who were subject to the pensionable earnings cap imposed by HM Revenue & Customs under the previous tax regime.
The assets of this scheme are held under individual trusts independently from the Groups finances.
There was no additional investment in these individual trusts during the year 2006 0.2 million as the Group has terminated its investment with effect from 5th April, 2006 to coincide with the tax changes introduced from that date.
Stakeholder pension DMGT provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for the other pension schemes operated by the Group.

i The deferred tax assets disclosed in the balance sheet in respect of overseas tax losses, relate primarily to trading losses incurred in the US and have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion, based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered probable that these assets will be recovered.
Of these assets, 10.1 million will expire between 2017 and 2025.
The remaining assets have no expiry date.
ii There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 25.3 million 2006 19.5 million which relates primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of 20.7 million 2006 26.1 million.
iii There is a potential taxable temporary difference in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures, principally in relation to as yet unremitted earnings from overseas subsidiaries.
The Group has estimated the potential taxable temporary difference to be approximately 801.5 million 2006 615.6 million.

Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET 119 continued 38 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES CONTINUED Contingent liabilities The Group is exposed to libel claims in the ordinary course of business and makes provision for the estimated costs to defend such claims.
Four writs claiming damages for libel have been issued in Malaysia against Euromoney Institutional Investor and three of its employees in respect of an article published in one of Euromoneys magazines, International Commercial Litigation, in November 1995.
The writs were served on Euromoney on 22nd October, 1996.
The total amount claimed is 280 million Malaysian ringgits, 40.3 million 2006 40.2 million.
No provision has been made in these accounts since the Directors do not believe that Euromoney has any material liability in respect of these writs.
39 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS The Group offers a number of share-based remuneration schemes to Directors and certain employees.
The principal schemes comprise share options under the DMGT, Euromoney and within DMG Information, Risk Management Solutions RMS, Genscape, Trepp and Dolphin Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS, the Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan and the Company's LTIP.
Share options are exercisable after three years, subject in some cases to the satisfaction of performance conditions, and up to ten years from the date of grant at a price equivalent to the market value of the respective shares at the date of grant.
The Group operates a long-term incentive plan for senior employees of the Groups local media division based on profit and revenue targets.
Participants in the scheme have the choice of being rewarded with a cash bonus or by taking A ordinary DMGT plc shares.
Where a participant chooses to take shares it is a condition of the scheme that the shares must be held for a minimum of two years.
No shares were awarded, forfeited or lapsed during the year.
The Group also operates a long-term incentive scheme for senior employees of the Groups national newspaper division based on cumulative profit targets for the three years to 30th September, 2007.
