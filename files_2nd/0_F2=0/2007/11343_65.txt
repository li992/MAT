POST-BALANCE SHEET EVENT Since the period-end, we have also announced the acquisition of ARINSO, a leading independent global provider of SAP-based HR services and solutions.
On 2 May 2007, Northgate announced that it had entered into an agreement with the majority shareholder to acquire, subject to shareholder approval, a 60.43% interest in ARINSO for 18.75 in cash and 5 new Northgate shares for each ARINSO share.
At an EGM held on 15 June 2007, shareholders formally approved the acquisition, which enabled Northgate to take a controlling interest and then subsequently launch a mandatory public offer to acquire the remaining shares in ARINSO.
This offer process is expected to close by September 2007.
In June 2007, a new 500m bank facility was secured, providing the Group with approximately 100m of headroom going forwards.
As part of drawing down this facility, the Group has put in place interest-hedging instruments to manage exposure to movements in interest rates over the next three years.
Over the next year, this covers around 85% of the available facility.
