Share rights Any share in the Company may be issued with such rights including preferred, deferred or other special rights or such restrictions, whether in regard to dividend, voting, return of capital or otherwise as the Company may from time to time by ordinary resolution determine or, in the absence of any such determination, as the Directors may determine.
