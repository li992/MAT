Employee share plans The Company operates two employee share plans: a share incentive plan SIP and long term incentive plans LTIPs both of which are equity settled.
In addition the Company operates a Shadow SIP scheme for Australian employees which is cash settled.

Shares awarded under the scheme are held in a UK trust in accordance with HM Revenue and Customs rules.
Employees are entitled to receive dividends on the shares held in trust for as long as they remain employees.
On 3 May 2005, the SIP awarded all UK employees, except executive directors, a total of 94,267 free shares which vested immediately and 470,758 additional free shares which vest after three years.
The price of ordinary shares on the award date was 1.20.
On 24 August 2006, the Company invited all UK employees to subscribe for up to 1,500 of partnership shares when the share price was 2.38.
IG offered to match every partnership share with 2 matching shares up to a maximum of 3,000.
The matching shares vest after three years.
Shadow SIP awards made to non-UK staff Shadow SIP awards are made to overseas staff and are cash settled.
The fair value of these awards is estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions of the award.
A liability is recognised over the expected vesting period and until the liability is settled it is re-measured at each reporting date with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
On 9 December 2005, Australian employees were awarded a total of 45,000 shares which will settle on a cash basis.
At the vesting date a bonus will be paid to each participant which is equivalent to the value of 2,500 IG shares at 31 May 2008.
IG Group Holdings plc 74 Report and Financial Statements 2007 Notes to the Financial Statements at 31 May 2007 25.
Employee share plans continued LTIP awards LTIPs allow the award of nil cost or nominal cost shares.
The fair value of awards made to UK staff is the price of ordinary shares at the grant date adjusted for the present value of future dividends to which the holder is not entitled.
UK employees awards crystallise automatically on the vesting date.
LTIP awards to Australian employees are legally categorised as options.
They are identical to awards made to UK staff, except that Australian employees are required to exercise their options upon vesting.
The fair values of awards made to Australian employees are calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
LTIPs vest if specific performance targets are achieved and are conditional upon continued employment at the vesting date.
Performance is measured as the compound annual growth rate in fully diluted earnings per share over the three year vesting period.
For each award a minimum performance target must be achieved before any shares vest and the awards vest fully once the maximum performance target is achieved.
Further information on the Companys LTIPs is given in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 32 to 39.
