Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes EmployeeSchemes The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002 is available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The scheme provides for employees to save up to 250 per month and gives them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 is offered to employees in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and France are able to participate respectively in the Smith & Nephew Belgian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Italian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Dutch Sharesave Plan 2002 and the Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002.
Participants in Ireland are able to participate in the Smith & Nephew Irish Employee Share Option Scheme.
These plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002.
Options are no longer issued under the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 14 May 1981 and the Smith & Nephew 1991 Overseas Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 25 May 1990 but options remain to be exercised under these two schemes.
Togetherall of the plans referred to above are termed the Employee Schemes.
Employees in the United States are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period to the market price, through a regular savings plan.
Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes continued ExecutiveSchemes The Smith & Nephew 1985 Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 9 May 1985, the Smith & Nephew 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 15 May 1990, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001 and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004 are together termed the Executive Schemes.
Under the terms of the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may approve the grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan are to acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares.
For options granted prior to 2001, the option price was not less than the market value of an Ordinary Share, or the nominal value if higher the market value being the quoted price on the business day preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
For Executive Schemes adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or, for the US Plan, the average quoted price of an ADS or Ordinary Share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan, the exercise of options granted from 1997 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan are not subject to performance conditions but become exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
The 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2004 Plan are open to senior managers worldwide.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan is open to senior managers outside the US and the US Plan is opentoseniormanagers inthe US, Canada, Mexicoand PuertoRico.
The maximum term of options granted, under all schemes, is 10 years from the date of grant.
All share optionschemes except forthe  Plan detailed onpage 117 are settled inshares.
Share Based Payments Share Option Schemes continued Theweighted average share pricesduringeachyear were as follows: 2005....................................................................... 524pence 2006....................................................................... 483pence 2007....................................................................... 601pence Optionsgranted duringthe year were as follows: Weighted average fair value Share per price Weighted Weighted optionat at average average Options grant grant exercise option granted date date price life Thousand Pence Pence Pence Years Employee Schemes................. 1,077 195.9 570.5 459.7 4.0 Executive Schemes.................. 5,209 202.2 631.8 629.5 6.3 The weighted average fair value of options granted under employee schemes during 2006 was 167p 2005 144p and those underexecutive schemes during2006 was 150p 2005 172p.
Options granted in 2007, 2006 and 2005 under the executive schemes were valued using a binomial model.
Options granted under employee schemes were valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management considered that options granted under these schemes are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
Options granted under each scheme are valued separately and a weighted average fair value calculated.
The binomial model was used for executive schemes so that proper allowance is made for the possibility of early exercise.
At the 2007 grant management expected 95% of the options granted under the 2001 Executive Scheme to vest 2006 95%, 2005 95% and 60% of the 2004 Executive Scheme to vest 2006 60%, 2005 60%.
Each year an assessment is made of the current vesting estimates and they are updated to reflect revised expectations of the number of grants that will vest.
This includes the effects of any modifications to the share schemes during the year.
In 2005 the Group announced its intention to report its results in US Dollars with effect from 2006.
For the 2005 awards, the Remuneration Committee decided to retain the same performance targets but base them on US Dollar numbers over the life of the award.
In order to reflect the different EPSA growths under US Dollar reporting the estimates of final vesting were amended for schemes with this criteria.
To the extent that this is a modification, there was no effect on the charge in the income statement.
Commencing in 2006 the impact on the share based payment charge in the income statement over the life of the options was an additional charge of approximately $1m.
Therewas noeffect onthe fair value of the share based payments as a result ofthischange.
For all schemes the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant.
The following assumptions were used incalculatingthe fair value of optionsgranted: Employee schemes Executive schemes 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 %, except Expected Lifeinyears Dividendyield............................... 1.0 1.5 1.1 1.0 1.5 1.1 Expected volatility i.......................... 23.0 25.0 26.0 23.0 25.0 26.0 Riskfree interest rate ii....................... 5.0 4.8 4.1 5.0 4.5 4.8 Expected life inyears iii....................... 4.0 3.9 3.9 6.3 6.6 6.4 i  onpastshareprice movements overthe expected lifeofthe options.

iii An assessment of an Executive Schemes option life is based on an exercise model.
This is based on a mixture of historic experience and generally accepted behavioural traits.

In addition, 50% 2006 50%, 2005 50% of Executive Scheme option holders are assumed to exercise by choice per annum providing the gain available is at least 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans 2006 50% for the 2004 Plan and 25% for the 2001 Plans, 2005 50%forthe 2004 Planand 25%forthe 2001 Plans.
Share Based Payment Long-TermIncentive Plans The Group operated a long-term incentive plan LTIP for executive directors and executive officers from 1997 to 2003.
Vesting of LTIP awards was dependent on the Groups relative performance in a group of 39 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities, using total shareholder return TSR overa three year periodas the primemeasure.
In 2004, a new share based incentive plan was introduced for executive directors, executive officers and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP and a BonusCo-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based  medicaldevices industry.
Under the CIP, participants can elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for 3 years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receiveanaward of matchingshares foreachshare purchased.
The fair values of awards granted under long term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model.
The exercise price for all awards granted under the long term incentive plans is nil.
The LTIP and PSP contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations.
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups.
Given the wide range of companies within the FTSE 100 a correlation of 20% 2006 20%, 2005 20% has been assumed with the constituents of the group.
A correlation of 20% 2006 30%, 2005 30% has also been assumed for the companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similarfactors.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the executive scheme assumptions disclosed in Note 28 a .

The total number of Ordinary Shares which may be issuable in any ten-year period under all share schemes operated by the Companymaynotexceed 10% of the OrdinaryShare capital at the date ofgrant.
