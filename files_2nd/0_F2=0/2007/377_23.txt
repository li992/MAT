General Information Aegis Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The address of the registered office is given on page 46.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 4 and in the Directors Report on pages 47 and 48.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 3.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below in note 3.
The Group believes that underlying results note 5 and underlying earnings per share note 12 provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term underlying is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to IFRS measurements of profit.
The principal adjustments made are in respect of items which are significant by nature or amount in the opinion of the directors.
These may include impairment charges and other adjusting items, including profits and losses on disposals of investments, amortisation of purchased intangible assets being amortisation charged on separately identifiable intangible assets in acquired businesses, unrealised gains and losses on non-hedge derivative financial instruments, fair value gains and losses on liabilities in respect of put option agreements, and any related tax thereon, as appropriate.
The Groups operations are split into two principal market sectors, namely media communications and market research.
These divisions are further analysed into geographic segments which bring together products in comparable market areas under common business heads.
This is how the Groups operational management is structured and its results are reviewed and thus form the primary reporting segments note 4.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating segments IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Accounting policies Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to all the periods presented in this Annual Report.
The Group has adopted the following amendments mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures The adoption of this accounting standard did not have any impact on the financial results of the Group in either the current or prior years.
The Standards adoption relates to additional disclosure requirements in both the current and prior years.
Balance sheet reclassifications The Group has revisited the classification of certain bank accounts and its revolving credit facility during the year and as a result, as at 31 December 2006 it has reclassified 21.7 million from trade and other receivables to cash, and 158.1 million borrowings from debt due within one year to debt due after more than one year.
Basis of consolidation a Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and the entities controlled by it after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any minority interests in those entities.
Control is achieved where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Where subsidiaries are acquired in the year, their results and cash flows are included from the date of acquisition up to the balance sheet date.
Where a consolidated company is less than 100% owned by the Group, the minority interest share of the results and net assets are recognised at each reporting date.
Minority interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
Where a company has net liabilities, no asset is recorded within minority interests unless the minority shareholder has an obligation to make good its share of the net liabilities.
A list of the significant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest is given in the notes to the Companys separate financial statements.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 69 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 3.
Accounting policies continued a Subsidiaries continued The companies listed immediately below are included in the consolidated financial statements of Aegis Group plc, as such we apply S264b HGB of the German Commercial Code.
Aegis Media GmbH & Co. Central Services, Wiesbaden CARAT Wiesbaden GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden HMS GmbH & Co. KG Media-Service, Wiesbaden CARAT Hamburg GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg 21 TwentyOne GmbH & Co. KG Markenberatung, Frankfurt b Associates Associated companies are entities in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies it exercises a significant influence and which are neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture.
The reporting dates and accounting policies used by its associates are the same as those used by the Group.
The Groups associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The Groups share of its associates post-acquisition profits or losses and any impairment of goodwill is recognised in the income statement and as a movement in the Groups share of associates net assets in the balance sheet.
Its share of any post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised directly in equity.
Losses of the associates in excess of the Groups interest in those associates are not recognised to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
c Joint ventures Joint ventures are investments over which the Group exercises joint control with a third party.
Such investments are equity accounted for, using the same method of equity accounting as described in associates above.
Business combinations and goodwill The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
Goodwill on acquisitions is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The interests of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured at the minoritys proportion of the net fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill recognised under UK GAAP prior to the date of transition to IFRS is stated at net book value as at that date.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is provided based on the directors best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
The liability is discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the income statement.
Changes to estimates of amounts payable are made to deferred consideration and goodwill.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Separately acquired intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition.
For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Groups valuation methodology, using discounted cash flows.
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development activities is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as software and new processes : it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
70 Aegis Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 3.
Accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued Where these criteria are met, the development expenditure is capitalised at cost.
Where they are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Intangible assets are amortised to residual values over the useful economic life of the asset as follows: Software 20% to 50% per annum Panel costs 33% per annum Patents and trademarks Nil to 20% per annum Other 10% to 50% per annum Where an assets useful life is considered indefinite, an annual impairment test is performed see below.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to write off the cost of these fixed assets to their residual value over their expected useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings 1% to 5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10% to 20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment and vehicles 10% to 50% per annum The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Inventory: work in progress Work in progress comprises directly attributable costs on incomplete market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
Turnover amounts invoiced to clients and revenue Turnover amounts invoiced to clients represents amounts invoiced for media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees invoiced for media and research services provided, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue is the value of media and research fees and commission earned by the Group.
Media revenue is recognised when charges are made to clients, principally when advertisements appear in the media.
Fees are recognised over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
Performance related income is recognised when it can be reliably estimated whether, and the extent to which, the performance criteria have been met.
For the market research business, revenue is recognised on the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project when identified.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Share-based payment transactions The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that remained unvested as of 1 January 2005.
Certain employees receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, including shares or rights over shares.
The cost of equitysettled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the instruments concerned at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 71 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 3.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payment transactions continued The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the vesting date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors at that date, will ultimately vest.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
Employee benefits The retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the income statement is the contribution payable in the year by Group companies.
In addition, the Group has a small number of funded defined benefit obligations, principally where required by local statutory regulations.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit obligations is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost less the fair value of the plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated using the project unit credit method with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds approximating to the terms of the related liability.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately outside the income statement and are presented in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon re-translation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments, including goodwill, are taken directly to reserves.
For consolidation purposes, the trading results and cash flows in foreign currencies, arising in foreign operations, are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the period.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
In the event of the disposal of an operation such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses.
Leased assets Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations from the transition date of 1 January 2004 in respect of intangible assets and properties.
A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
72 Aegis Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 3.
Accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, including interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Segment reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Segment result is segment operating profit stated before share of results of associated undertakings and joint ventures.
Financial instruments Financial assets Financial assets are accounted for on the trade date.
Financial assets and financial liabilities principally include the following: Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash at bank and in hand and deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, net of overdrafts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs and at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the period.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for equity instruments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities and equity Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Direct issue costs are amortised over the period of the loans and overdrafts to which they relate.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption are charged to the income statement as incurred using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely-related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
The Groups activities expose it to certain financial risks including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in this way are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitments or forecast transactions are recognised in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses on the hedging instrument recognised in equity are retained until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Annual Report and Accounts 2007 73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 3.
Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Financial liabilities and equity continued Equity instruments Ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Investments in own shares, held through the Aegis Group Employee Share Trust, are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity at cost.
The costs of administration of the Trust are included in the income statement as they accrue.
Liabilities in respect of option agreements Option agreements that allow the Groups equity partners to require the Group to purchase the minority interest are treated as derivatives over equity instruments and are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value.
The fair values of such options are re-measured at each period end.
The movement in the fair value is recognised as income or expense within finance charges in the income statement.
The Group recognises its best estimate of the amount it is likely to pay, should these options be exercised by the minority interests, as a liability in the balance sheet.
Accounting estimates and judgements The Group makes estimates and judgement concerning the future and the resulting estimates may, by definition, vary from the related actual results.
The Directors considered the critical accounting estimates and judgements used in the Accounts and concluded that the main areas of judgement are: revenue recognition policies in respect of performance related income: contingent deferred payments in respect of acquisitions: recognition of share based payments: valuation of intangible assets: and goodwill impairment.
The estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that management and the Board of Directors believe are reasonable under the circumstances and are discussed, to the extent necessary, in more detail in their respective notes.

This allocation largely represents the Groups primary and secondary reporting segments as set out below.
Any goodwill associated with the individual cash generating units subsumed within these reporting segments is not individually significant when compared to the goodwill of the Group.

Goodwill continued An impairment of 2.0 million was charged in respect of one of the Groups subsidiaries in China and one in Asia following the deterioration in the performance of this business.
During 2006, an impairment of 1.4 million was charged in respect of one of the Groups companies in India following the deterioration in the performance of this business.
The allocation of goodwill presented above is net of impairment.
In 2006, an impairment of 3.9 million was booked in respect of one of the Groups associates in India.
The recoverable amount of a cash generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next year and extrapolates cash flows for the following four years based on estimated growth rates of between 9% and 12%.
After this time, cash flows are extrapolated based on the estimated long-term growth in gross domestic product of 3.0%.
Cash flow projections are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.28%.
Expected future cash flows are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time.
They are significantly affected by a number of factors such as market growth, discount rates, currency exchange rates and future capital expenditure.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their recoverable amounts.

Financial instruments The Group has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in further detail in the Treasury Management section of the Business and Financial Review on pages 26 to 37.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the Groups borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital and reserves and retained earnings.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities takes place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and upon consolidation following the translation of the local currency results and net assets liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
The Group is a party to a number of foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Groups principal markets.
These are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
The total notional amounts of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed are shown below.
2007 2006 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 42.4 42.6 The fair values of currency derivatives included in the balance sheet are based on market values supplied by the banks through which the currency derivatives were acquired.
Movements in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts are taken to the income statement.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
It is estimated that a strengthening of sterling by 1% would reduce 2007 profit before tax by 1.7 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had net debt before issue costs of new debt of 246.8 million 2006: 208.9 million.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 356.8 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 284.2 million and gross borrowings of 603.6 million 2006: 493.1 million.
The Groups principal debt instruments are subject to certain financial covenants.
Also included within gross borrowings is 6.5 million US$13 million 2006: 67.1 million US$131.5 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000, which are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008, and 172.3 million US$342 million 2006: 174.6 million US$342 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 28 July 2005, which are repayable in full between 2012 and 2017, and 63.0 million US$125m of unsecured loan notes issued on 17 September 2007 which are repayable in full between 2014 and 2017.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2007, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 185.6 million 2006: 265.4 million.
Interest rate risk The Groups unsecured loan notes, referred to above, are at fixed rates.
All other borrowings are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to US$160 million of unsecured loan notes Private Placement Debt November 2000 from fixed into floating rates.
The balance at the end of the period was US$13 million.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Group to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash balances.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet in respect of trade receivables are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.

Financial instruments continued The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term debtors and trade creditors have been excluded from all disclosures provided in this note.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no currency risk disclosures have been provided.
Private Placement Debt November 2000 On 20 November 2000, the Group issued US$160 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2006 and 2008.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Interest rate swaps have been entered into for the duration of the loan notes to convert this fixed rate borrowing into floating rate based upon the US six-month LIBOR rate.
These interest rate swaps are designated as hedging instruments of interest rate risk in respect of this debt.
When the hedge relationship is effective, the carrying value of this debt is adjusted by the changes in fair value attributable to interest rate risk at the balance sheet date.
The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk in respect of the above borrowings being at floating rates.
US$118.5 million was settled during the year.
Interest rate swaps The fair value of the interest rate swaps entered into at 31 December 2007 and included in the balance sheet is 0.1 million 2006: 0.9 million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
0.1 million of this is expected to be realised in 2008.
The interest rate swaps are designated and effective as fair value hedges against changes in the fair value of the debt caused by changes in interest rates.
Movements in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are taken to the income statement where they offset against very similar but opposite movements in the fair value of the debt caused by movements in interest rates.
Private Placement Debt July 2005 On 28 July 2005, the Group issued US$342 million of unsecured loan notes, repayable between 2012 and 2017.
On 9 November 2005 cross currency swaps were entered into for US$142 million of the loan notes due in 2012 and US$50 million of the loan notes due in 2015 to convert this US$ fixed rate borrowing into EUR fixed rate borrowing.
These loan notes are guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and are used to provide a hedge against US dollar-denominated investments.
To the extent that this hedging relationship is effective, exchange differences arising on the re-translation of the US$150 million of debt not impacted by the cross currency swaps are taken directly to reserves.
Cross currency swaps The fair value of the cross currency swaps entered into at 31 December 2007 is 15.9 million 2006: 9.3 million.
The fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model and market interest yield curves applicable and represents movements in the Euro US$ foreign exchange spot rate and in Euro and US$ interest rate yields.
The cross currency swaps are synthetically split, for accounting purposes, to reflect the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The US$ Sterling leg of the swaps act as cash flow hedges against the Groups US$ loan notes and the Euro Sterling leg of the swaps act as net investment hedges in respect of certain of the Groups Eurodenominated investments.
Multi-currency credit facility June 2006 On 9 June 2006, the Group raised a five-year 450 million multi-currency credit facility with a group of international banks.
The facility is committed and revolving and allows drawings under a variety of currencies.
Pricing is based on the inter-bank rate of the relevant currency for the corresponding period of the drawing with the interest margin determined by reference to a grid based on the consolidated net borrowings to consolidated net EBITDA ratio.
The facility is unsecured but guaranteed by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries.
Private Placement Debt September 2007 On 17 September 2007, the Group issued US$125 million of unsecured loan notes repayable between 2014 and 2017.

It is managements view that the short term nature of these deposits means they effectively act as floating rate assets.
Cash and cash equivalents of 356.8 million 2006: 284.2 million and other financial assets of 0.3 million 2006: 16.4 million represent the floating rate financial assets above.
The Group has reclassified certain bank accounts during the period and as a result it has reclassified 21.7 million at 31 December 2006 from trade and other receivables to cash.
In addition to the financial assets above, the Group had available-for-sale financial asset investments of 2.3 million 2006: 2.8 million principally in US dollars, which do not yield an interest-related income.
Financial instruments continued b Interest rate profile continued The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 2007 2006 % % Bank overdrafts 5.4 3.4 Bank loans 6.0 4.9 Loan notes 5.4 5.0 Convertible bond 7.2 The Groups borrowings, excluding the US$342 million of unsecured loan notes issued in 2005 and US$125 million of unsecured loan notes issued in 2007 but including the US$13 million 2006: US$131.5 million unsecured loan notes referred to above, are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to the US$13 million 2006: US$131.5 million unsecured loan notes from fixed into floating rates.
At 31 December 2007, it is estimated that a general simultaneous parallel uplift of 1% in interest rates would reduce the Groups reported profit by approximately 0.1 million.
Sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 1% increase in Sterling against the significant foreign currencies of the Group.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 1% change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis includes external loans.
For a 1% weakening of sterling against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit and other equity.

The total amount of tax losses and other temporary differences for which no deferred tax was recognised at 31 December 2006 was 159.1 million.
Balances in the subsidiary entities are shown on a 100% basis, regardless of ownership percentage.
Balances for joint ventures are shown in proportion to the Group's ownership percentage.
Balances in associates are not included.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of earnings in overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 303.3 million 2006: 318.4 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and joint ventures are insignificant.

Share-based payments continued The fair value of share options was determined using a stochastic model and the following assumptions: 2007 2006 Expected life 5 years 3 years Weighted average share price 149.00 135.75 Weighted average exercise price 147.50 134.00 Expected volatility 19.0% 23.0% Risk free rate 5.7% 4.4% Expected dividend yield 1.4% 1.2% Expected volatility was determined by considering the historical volatility of the Groups share price over the previous five years, with certain periods where the share price was particularly volatile for specific reasons, being disregarded as these were not considered to be indicative of expected future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a total expense of 1.3 million 2006: 2.1 million in respect of share options in the year.
Conditional share awards The Group issues conditional share awards to certain employees.
The extent to which awards vest is determined partly by reference to the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to a group of similar businesses and partly by reference to the Companys EPS growth relative to RPI.
The fair value of conditional share awards was determined using a stochastic model using the assumptions given in the table above.
The Group recognised a total expense of 7.8 million 2006: 4.8 million in respect of conditional share awards in the year.
