Other than betting and gaming transactions, the Group does not hold any financial instruments for trading purposes.
The fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates to book value due to its short-term maturity.
The amortised costs of bank loans approximates to book value, as these are re-priced at intervals of six months or less.
During the close period, the period between the year end and the preliminary annual results announcement, the Group is prevented from purchasing its own shares by the UK Listing Authoritys Listing Rules.
The Group entered into a contingent agreement in 2007 with its brokers to purchase shares during the close period.
It is this commitment of 30.0 million 2006: nil, being the maximum value of the share buyback during the close period authorised by shareholders which is recognised under other financial liabilities in the balance sheet.

Annual Report and Accounts 2007 81 Ladbrokes R&A 07 Back1:Ladbrokes R&A 07 Back1 19 3 08 11:54 Page 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 27 Financial instruments continued Financial guarantee contracts The Group has given guarantees to third parties in respect of lease liabilities of subsidiaries within the disposed hotels division.
The Group has an indemnity received from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels division disposal, in relation to any loss the Group may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees is 1,228.1 million 2006: 1,288.9 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
The maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Group has entered.
These guarantees expire between 2009 and 2042 and the net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2007 is 635.8 million 2006: 658.9 million.
The Group monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new leases being identified.
The financial guarantee asset has been valued on a similar basis to the liability, taking account of historic default data from internationally recognised credit-rating agencies and the credit profile of the counter party, HHC, to assess the likelihood of HHC continuing to be solvent at the time of any future potential claim under the indemnity.
At 31 December 2007 the Group has recognised a financial liability of 10.0 million 2006: 14.0 million in respect of these guarantees together with a financial asset of 3.0 million 2006: 7.0 million in relation to the indemnity.
Fair value of guarantees liability 2007 2006 m m As at 1 January 14.0 Initial recognition of guarantees liability on hotels disposal 14.0 Change in fair value attributable to hotels default risk 3.0 Guarantees expiring in the year 1.0 As at 31 December 10.0 14.0 Fair value of guarantee asset 2007 2006 m m As at 1 January 7.0 Initial recognition of guarantee asset on hotels disposal 7.0 Change in fair value attributable to credit risk of counterparty 4.0 As at 31 December 3.0 7.0 The change in the year in the fair value of the financial guarantee liability and asset have been recognised in the income statement and classified in discontinued operations.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotel default rate.
A rate of 1.2 per cent has been used as at 31 December 2007 2006: 1.7 per cent.
A 0.25 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 2.0 million.

The fixed rate bonds and the interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
b At 31 December 2007, the Group had interest rate swap agreements in place that had an impact of switching 19.0 million of bank debt from floating rate debt to fixed rate debt.
The floating rate bank debt and the interest rate swaps have the same critical terms.
c During December 2007, the Group entered into further interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flows of 180.0 million of bank borrowings with effect from 29 July 2008.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than six months.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the exchange rates between sterling and these currencies is shown below: GBP by 10% 2007 2006 m m Effect on profit before tax: Euro balances 6.4 3.8 US Dollar balances 6.9 SE Krona balances 0.5 Interest rates The Groups policy is to maintain a minimum of 25 per cent of net debt at fixed interest rates and is therefore sensitive to movements in variable short-term interest rates.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on income and equity for the year when this movement is applied to the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities.
The impact on equity is not significant.
2007 2006 m m Effect on profit before tax: Increase in interest rates by 100 basis points 6.2 9.5 Decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points 6.2 9.5 Sensitivity has been estimated by applying the basis points movement to the carrying value of the financial assets and liabilities held by the Group at the period end.
Hedging activities Hedging of net investments in foreign operations The Group has continued to hold and enter into foreign exchange swaps and cross currency swaps that do not qualify as net investment hedges under IAS 39 but that are economic hedges of the Groups foreign currency borrowings.
The fair value of the Groups cross currency swaps is 1.2 million 2006: 2.2 million, comprising 1.2 million 2006: 2.2 million assets and nil 2006: nil liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups foreign currency swaps is an asset of 29.0 million 2006: liability of 9.4 million, comprising 29.0 million 2006: nil assets and nil 2006: 9.4 million liabilities.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its fair value exposure to interest rate movements on its borrowings by swapping borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates in accordance with the policy of the Group.
Contracts with nominal values of 542.6 million 2006: 666.6 million have fixed interest receipts and floating interest payments based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The contracts are outstanding for periods up until 2009.
The fair value of these swaps at 31 December 2007 is 3.3 million 2006: 11.3 million.
Cash flow hedges During December 2007, the Group entered into contracts for interest rate swaps with nominal values of 180 million maturing between January 2011 and January 2012.
These contracts have floating rate receipts and fixed rate payables and take effect on 29 July 2008.
The fair value at 31 December 2007 was a liability of 0.8 million which has been deferred in equity.
Interest rate swap contracts in place at 31 December 2007 include a contract maturing in 2011, entered into during 2007, with a nominal value of 19.0 million with floating rate receipts and fixed rate payables.
The fair value of this interest rate swap contract at 31 December 2007 was a liability of 0.2 million, which has been deferred in equity.
At 31 December 2006, the Group held interest rate swap contracts to hedge its cash flow exposure on its floating rate SEK 300 million loan note.
These interest rate swap contracts had a nominal value of 22.3 million and matured in December 2007.
The fair value of these interest rate swap contracts had been extinguished at maturity.
The movement in the fair value of these interest rate swap contracts during the year ended 31 December 2007 of 0.5 million has been recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
There is no ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges.
Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure net debt and equity see notes 28 and 30 for further details and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using a net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The target range is 3.5 to 3.75 times net debt to EBITDA ratio.
The ratio at 31 December 2007 was 1.9 3.1 adjusted to remove profit from high rollers and at 31 December 2006 was 3.1 3.2 adjusted to remove profit from high rollers.
The Group has an ongoing share buyback programme which commenced on 10 August 2007, and it is intended that, over time, the Group will repurchase shares in order to move towards its target net debt to EBITDA range.
