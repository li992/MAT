NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Statement of compliance SABMiller plc the company is a public limited company incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales.
The company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified for the revaluation of financial instruments, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
A summary of the significant company accounting policies is set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
The company has not presented a cash flow statement or provided details of related party transactions as permitted under FRS 1 revised Cash Flow Statements and FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures respectively.
Adoption of new accounting standards The ASB issued an amendment to FRS 26 Financial Instruments Measurement in April 2006.
This has been adopted by the company with effect from 1 April 2005.
The amended standard implements the sections of IAS 39 relating to recognition and derecognition.
The effect of the change in the accounting policy to adopt the amendment was to increase profit in 2006 by US$7 million and 2007 by US$7 million.
As at 31 March 2006 debtors increased by US$35 million and creditors increased by US$28 million, of which US$28 million and US$22 million fall due after more than one year respectively.
c. Investments in subsidiary undertakings These comprise investments in shares and loans that the directors intend to hold on a continuing basis in the companys business.
The investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
A review for the potential impairment of an investment is carried out if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.
Such impairment reviews are performed in accordance with FRS 11. d. Foreign currencies The financial statements are presented in US dollars which is the companys functional and presentational currency.
Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date with the resultant translation differences being included in operating profit, other than those arising on financial liabilities which are recorded within net finance costs.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
All other non-monetary items denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
e. Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
In respect of all other tangible fixed assets, depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Office equipment 2-30 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of the lease term or 50 years The company regularly reviews its depreciation rates to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the company takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
The profit or loss on the sale of an asset is the difference between the disposal proceeds and the net book value, including any revaluation, of the asset.
Any amount in the revaluation reserve relating to such an asset is transferred directly to shareholders funds and is not included in the profit for the financial year.
f. Impairment In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, fixed assets are subject to an impairment review if circumstances or events change to indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
The review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the fixed asset to its recoverable amount, being the higher of the net realisable value and value in use.
The net realisable value is considered to be the amount that could be obtained on disposal of the asset.
The value in use of the asset is determined by discounting, at a market based discount rate, the expected future cash flows resulting from its continued use, including those arising from its final disposal.
When the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by any impairment amount, the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it is incurred.
Should circumstances or events change and give rise to a reversal of a previous impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs and the carrying value of the asset is increased.
The increase in the carrying value of the asset will only be up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, income producing units are considered to be groups of assets and liabilities that generate income, and are largely independent of other income streams.
They also include those assets and liabilities directly involved in producing the income and a suitable proportion of those used to produce more than one income stream.
SABMiller plc Annual Report 2007 Notes to the company financial statements 130 Overview Operating and financial review Governance Financial statements Shareholder information g. Financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transactions costs where applicable.
For those financial instruments that are not subsequently held at fair value, the company assesses whether there is any objective evidence of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are recognised when the company has rights or other access to economic benefits.
Such assets consist of cash, equity instruments, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset, or a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially favourable terms.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred and the company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation to transfer benefits and that obligation is a contractual liability to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is discharged, cancelled or expired.
If a legally enforceable right exists to set off recognised amounts of financial assets and liabilities, which are in determinable monetary amounts, the relevant financial assets and liabilities are offset.
Interest costs are charged against income in the year in which they accrue.
Premiums or discounts arising from the difference between the net proceeds of financial instruments purchased or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable at maturity are included in the effective interest calculation and taken to net interest payable over the life of the instrument.
i Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for maturities of greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Investments in this category are initially recognised at fair value including originating fees and transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
ii Trade debtors Trade debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade debtors is established when there is objective evidence that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the terms of the receivables.
The impairment is recognised in the income statement.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, bank deposits repayable on demand, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Term deposits with maturities of more than three months are shown as term deposits on the balance sheet.
Bank overdrafts are shown within creditors amounts falling due within one year.
iv Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are financial instruments whose value changes in response to an underlying variable, require little or no initial investment and are settled in the future.
These include derivatives embedded in host contracts.
Such embedded derivatives need not be accounted for separately if the host contract is already fair valued, if it would not be considered as a derivative if it was freestanding, or if it can be demonstrated that it is closely related to the host contract.
There are certain currency exemptions which the company has applied to these rules which limit the need to account for certain potential embedded foreign exchange derivatives.
These are: if a contract is denominated in the functional currency of either party: where that currency is commonly used in international trade of the good traded: or if it is commonly used for local transactions in an economic environment.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are analysed between current and non-current assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet, depending on when they are expected to mature.
For derivatives that have not been designated to a hedging relationship, all fair value movements are recognised immediately in the income statement.
See note l for the companys accounting policy on hedge accounting.
v Trade creditors Trade creditors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Trade creditors are analysed between current and non-current liabilities on the face of the balance sheet, depending on when the obligation to settle will be realised.
vi Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and are subsequently stated at amortised cost and include accrued interest and prepaid interest.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months from the balance sheet date.
vii Financial guarantees FRS 26 Amendment requires that issued financial guarantees, other than those previously asserted by the entity to be insurance contracts, are to be initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised and the amount determined in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
Financial guarantee contracts are defined in FRS 26 as contracts that require the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
h. Turnover Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties and excludes value added tax.
Turnover is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership are substantially transferred to the customer.
Notes to the company financial statements SABMiller plc Annual Report 2007 131 NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued i.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Dividend distributions In accordance with FRS 21, dividend distributions to equity holders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements of the company in the period in which the dividends are approved by the companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised, as there is no present obligation at the balance sheet date.
k. Share-based compensation The company operates several equity-settled share-based compensation schemes.
These include option plans with and without non-market performance conditions attached.
In accordance with FRS 20, an expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award granted after 7 November 2002 over the vesting period on a straight-line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest.
This expense is offset by a corresponding adjustment made to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
The charge is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant, as calculated by binomial model calculations.
The charge is not reversed if the options have not been exercised because the market value of the shares is lower than the option price at the date of grant.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
l. Hedge accounting The derivative instruments used by the company, which are used solely for hedging purposes i. e. to offset foreign exchange and interest rate risks, comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Such derivative instruments are used to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the company in line with the companys risk management policies.
The company also has derivatives embedded in other contracts, primarily cross border foreign currency supply contracts for raw materials.
Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the hedging relationship.
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the company is required to document the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.
The company is also required to document and demonstrate that the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument will be highly effective.
This effectiveness test is re-performed at each period end to ensure that the hedge has remained and will continue to remain highly effective.
The company designates certain derivatives as hedges of the fair of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge.
i Fair value hedges Fair value hedges comprise derivative financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage the companys interest rate risk to which the fair value of certain assets and liabilities are exposed.
Changes in the fair value of the derivative offset the relevant changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk in the profit and loss account in the period incurred.
Gains or losses on fair value hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recorded in the profit and loss account together with the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Where a derivative ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedging instrument or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold, matures or is extinguished, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic hedges under the companys policies, are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify or have not been designated as hedges are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Details of the groups financial risk management objectives and policies are provided on pages 39 and 40. ii Cash flow hedges Cash flow hedges comprise derivative financial instruments designated in a hedging relationship to manage currency risk to which the cash flows of certain liabilities are exposed.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative that is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting is recognised as a separate component of equity.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss.
However, where a forecasted transaction results in a non-financial asset or liability, the accumulated fair value movements previously deferred in equity are included in the initial cost of the asset or liability.
m. Operating leases Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
