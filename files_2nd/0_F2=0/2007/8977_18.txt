ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 1.
CORPORATE INFORMATION a ORGANISATION AND OPERATION Kazakhmys PLC the Company is a public limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
The Companys registered address is 6th Floor, Cardinal Place, 100 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL, United Kingdom.
The Group comprises the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as set out below.
The Group operates in the natural resources industry.
The Groups operations are primarily conducted through the Companys principal subsidiary, Kazakhmys Corporation LLC whose major business is the mining and processing of copper ore into copper cathodes and copper wire, and the re ning and sale of precious metals and other by-products of its copper mining process.
It also provides other services to various external customers.
The principal activities of the Company and the signi cant subsidiaries divisions as at 31 December 2007 are as follows: Operating entity Principal activity Country of incorporation Kazakhmys PLC Holding company and sales United Kingdom Kazakhmys Corporation LLC Mining and processing copper Kazakhstan Kazakhmys Gold Mining and processing gold Kazakhstan Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP Oil and gas exploration Kazakhstan MKM Mansfelder Kupfer und Messing GmbH Copper processing Germany b KAZAKHSTAN BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND COUNTRY RISK The Groups operations are subject to country risk being the economic, political and social risks inherent in doing business in Kazakhstan.
These risks include matters arising out of the policies of the Government, economic conditions, imposition of, or changes to, taxes and regulations, foreign exchange rate uctuations and the enforceability of contract rights.
The consolidated financial statements re ect the Directors assessment of the impact of the Kazakhstan business environment on the operations and the financial position of the Group.
The future business environment may differ from the Directors assessment.
c FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed to the effect of uctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to the prices of other metals, including zinc, gold and silver, which are also products produced by the Group.
Refer to note 33 for a description of other financial risks.
d ORE RESERVES AND RECOVERABILITY OF FIXED ASSETS The Groups operations are dependent upon the mining and processing of mineral products from deposits primarily within Kazakhstan and neighbouring Central Asian countries.
The long-term economic viability of the Group is dependent upon the continuing availability of suf cient economically recoverable ore reserves and the ongoing renewal of subsoil use rights.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements set out on pages 65 to 123 have been prepared using consistent accounting policies.
The Group has changed the presentation in respect of its mine development costs and mine stripping costs from that disclosed in the 2006 Annual Report.
Mine development costs, which were previously included within property, plant and equipment, have now been reclassi ed under Mining assets which includes mine stripping costs.
The revised presentation of mining assets is consistent with the Groups internal management reporting structure.
The Company has taken the exemption under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not published the Company income statement and related notes.
a BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain classes of property, plant and equipment which have been revalued at 1 January 2002 to determine deemed cost as part of the first-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS at that date, and derivative financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars $ and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollar $ million except when otherwise indicated.
b BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements set out the Groups financial position as at 31 December 2007 and the Groups financial performance for the year ended 31 December 2007.
Subsidiaries are those enterprises controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recognised as positive goodwill.
Negative goodwill arises where the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets of the subsidiary exceeds the cost of the acquisition.
Negative goodwill is recognised directly in the income statement.
BASIS OF PREPARATION continued The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised pro ts arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated in full.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Minority interests primarily represent the interests in Kazakhmys LLC not held by the Company.
The Company applies the equity concept method of consolidation and accounts for the acquisition of minority interests within equity.
Refer to note 48 for a list of the Companys signi cant subsidiaries.
c STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE The consolidated financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC of the IASB, as adopted by the European Union up to 31 December 2007, and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Acts 1985 and 2006. d NEW STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET ADOPTED In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Group has not applied the following relevant standards and interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective: IFRS 3 Business combinations which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRS 3 provides greater guidance on how an entity recognises and measures a business combination and what information is required to be disclosed: IFRS 8 Operating segments which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
Upon adoption of IFRS 8, the Group will have to disclose additional financial and descriptive information about its reportable segments.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets: IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements Revised which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 1 has been revised to enhance the usefulness of information presented in the financial statements, and will lead to changes in the presentation and disclosures within the financial statements.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets: IAS 23 Borrowing Costs Revised which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 23 Revised requires all borrowing costs to be capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset.
The accounting standard will be applicable for the Group as it takes on debt to finance capital projects and acquisitions: IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements Revised which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The amendments to IAS 27 primarily relate to the accounting for non-controlling interests and the loss of control of a subsidiary: IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and treasury scheme transactions, which is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
The Interpretation provides further guidance on the application of IFRS 2 Share based payments in speci c situations.
The Directors do not anticipate, in light of the circumstances prevailing at the date of approval of this Annual Report, that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group in the period of initial application.
e SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES i JUDGEMENTS In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimates, which have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: USEFUL ECONOMIC LIVES AND IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS Tangible and intangible assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
Management reviews the useful economic lives at least once a year and any changes that could affect the depreciation rates prospectively and hence the asset carrying values.
Management also reviews its tangible and intangible assets, including mining properties, for possible impairment if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable.
In assessing any assets for impairment, factors leading to signi cant reduction in pro ts such as changes in commodity prices, the Groups business plans and signi cant downward revision in the estimated mining reserves are taken into consideration.
The carrying value of the assets of a cash generating unit CGU and associated mining reserves is compared with the fair value of those assets, that is, the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future cash ows.
This involves management estimates on commodity prices, market demand and supply, economic and regulatory climates, long term mine plans and other factors.
Any subsequent changes to cash ows due to changes in the above mentioned factors could impact the carrying value of the assets.
ALLOCATION OF EXCESS PURCHASE CONSIDERATION The acquisition of mining assets involves estimation over the allocation of the excess purchase consideration over the fair value of assets, including the mining reserves and resources, being acquired.
The estimate of reserves is subject to assumptions relating to life of the mine and may change when new information becomes available.
Changes in reserves as a result of factors such as production costs, recovery rates, grade of reserves or commodity prices could impact depreciation rates, asset carrying values and environmental and restoration provisions.
Changes in assumptions over long term commodity prices, market demand and supply and economic and regulatory climates could also impact on the carrying value of assets.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 74 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION continued DETERMINATION OF EXCESS PROFITS TAXATION The determination of the Groups obligations and expenses for taxes requires an interpretation of tax legislation.
Excess pro ts tax EPT is imposed on the Group in addition to Kazakhstan corporate income tax on certain pro table subsoil contracts.
EPT is based on an approximation of the internal rate of return IRR with EPT being applicable only where the cumulative IRR exceeds 20%.
In determining the IRR for each subsoil contract, there is considerable judgement involved as to the allocation of pro t amongst the Groups subsoil contracts, the nature of deductions for capital expenditure and the timing of those deductions.
Management believes its judgements are reasonable and in compliance with the legislation, although there is a risk that the tax authorities will have a different interpretation of tax legislation.
ACCOUNTING FOR POTENTIAL TRANSFER PRICING LIABILITIES For the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2007, Kazakhmys LLC sold its exported products to Kazakhmys PLC under an exclusive purchasing agreement at the prevailing LME price, with no discount to LME price in 2006, but with a discount to LME price in 2007 re ecting the risks borne by Kazakhmys PLC in 2007 due to changes in contractual terms with customers.
Management believes that these prices, and accompanying discount where applicable, re ect the balance of commercial and credit risks shared between Kazakhmys LLC and Kazakhmys PLC.
Management has recognised the nature of the transfer pricing legislation promulgated in Kazakhstan and the UK in determining any consequential tax liabilities in these jurisdictions resulting from the sale of exported products from Kazakhmys LLC to Kazakhmys PLC for 2006 and 2007. ii ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
In particular, the following areas of the accounts include a signi cant degree of estimating uncertainty: note 12 Income tax: note 16 Property, plant and equipment: note 17 Mining assets: note 27 Employee bene ts: note 28 Provisions: note 34 Commitments and contingencies.
f COMPARATIVE FIGURES Where a change in the presentational format of the consolidated financial statements has been made during the year, comparative gures have been restated accordingly.
g CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES There have been no changes in accounting policies.
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following signi cant accounting policies have been applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
These accounting policies have been consistently applied.
a FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or the translation of monetary assets and liabilities at period end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
The functional currency of the Company is US dollars $ as the majority of its operating activities are conducted in US dollars.
The functional currencies of Kazakhmys LLC, Kazakhmys Gold and Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP is the Kazakhstan tenge KZT and of MKM is the Euro.
On consolidation, income statements of subsidiaries are translated into US dollars, at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated into US dollars at period end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the retranslation are taken to a separate component of equity.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings nancing those net investments are also dealt with in equity.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the income statement in the year in which they arise.
The following foreign exchange rates against the US dollar have been used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2007 2007 2006 2006 Kazakhstan tenge 120.30 122.55 127.00 126.09 Euro 0.68 0.73 0.76 0.78 UK pounds sterling 0.50 0.50 0.51 0.54 KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 75 3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued b INTANGIBLE ASSETS i GOODWILL On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture, associate, or joint arrangement, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Those mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights for which, in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair value attributable to the Groups share of the identi able net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses.
Goodwill is not amortised, rather it is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units expected to bene t from the related business combination for the purpose of the impairment testing.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
ii OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets, including mineral and petroleum licences, which are acquired by the Group and which have nite useful lives, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any negative goodwill arising on the acquisition.
iii AMORTISATION Intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily comprise mineral licence acquisition costs, which are amortised on a unit of production basis.
Amortisation for other intangible assets, which have expected useful lives of three to ten years, is computed under the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
c RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scienti c or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has suf cient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
d TANGIBLE ASSETS i PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost or deemed cost of property, plant and equipment hereafter referred to as cost at 1 January 2002, the date of Kazakhmys LLCs transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to its depreciated replacement cost at that date in accordance with IFRS 1.
The cost of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset or on a unit of production basis depending on the type of asset.
Changes in estimates, which affect unit of production calculations, are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences on the date the assets are used within the business.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 1525 years Plant and equipment 425 years Fixtures and ttings 315 years ii CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS Assets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category.
The cost of a tangible xed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Construction in progress is not depreciated.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued iii REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately, is capitalised with the carrying amount of the component being written off.
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is capitalised if future economic bene ts will arise from the expenditure.
All other expenditure, including repairs and maintenance expenditure, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
iv GOVERNMENT GRANTS Government grants are recognised at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with.
When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognised as income over the periods necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate.
Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to the cost of the asset and is released to the income statement over the expected useful life in a consistent manner with the depreciation method for the relevant asset.
v LEASING AND HIRE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased items, are capitalised at the commencement of the lease.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised lease assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.
All other leases are treated as operating leases and the cost is expensed to the income statement as incurred.
vi MINING ASSETS Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Costs associated with a start-up period for signi cant developments are capitalised during the commissioning period development expenditure where the asset is incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral properties are amortised using proven developed and undeveloped reserves.
Mine development costs are, upon commencement of production, depreciated using a unit of production method using proven developed reserves based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate.
Mine stripping costs incurred in order to access the mineral-bearing ore deposits are deferred prior to the commencement of production.
Such costs are amortised over the remaining life of the mine on a unit of production basis using proven developed reserves.
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mines production phase is deferred if the stripping activity permits an increase in the output of the mine in future periods through providing access to additional sources of reserves that will be produced in future periods.
Capitalised stripping costs are amortised in systematic manner over the reserves that directly bene t from the speci c stripping activity.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired through a purchase or transaction, is carried forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful exploration and development of the area of interest or, alternatively, by its sale: exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and signi cant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written off.
Administrative and general expenses relating to exploration and evaluation activities are expensed as incurred.
A signi cant portion of exploration and evaluation expenditure relates to mineral licences, which are classi ed and accounted for as intangible assets.
Identi able exploration and evaluation assets acquired in a purchase transaction are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition from another mining company.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Exploration and evaluation assets attributable to producing interests are amortised on a unit of production basis.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued e OIL AND GAS ASSETS i EXPLORATION, EVALUATION AND PRODUCTION ASSETS The Group adopts the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and appraisal costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised in cost centres by well, eld or exploration area, as appropriate.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to speci c exploration and development activities.
Pre-licence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
All capitalised licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are then written off unless commercial reserves have been established, or the determination process has not been completed and there are no indications of impairment.
All eld development costs are capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment related to production activities are amortised on a unit of production basis.
ii COMMERCIAL RESERVES Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are fide ned as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a speci ed degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves.
iii DEPLETION AND AMORTISATION DISCOVERY FIELDS All expenditure carried within each eld is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves over the life of the eld, generally on a eld-byeld basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future eld development costs.
Changes in the estimates of commercial reserves or future eld development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in a discovery eld, the recoverability of the net book value relating to that eld is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash ows based on managements expectations of future oil and gas prices and future costs.
Any impairment identi ed is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
f NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS Non-current investments in subsidiaries are included in the Company financial statements at cost.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
g IMPAIRMENT The carrying amounts of non-current assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such review is undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash ows independent of other assets, in which case the review is undertaken at the cash generating unit level.
If the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to re ect the asset or cash-generating unit at the lower amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
i CALCULATION OF RECOVERABLE AMOUNT The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci c to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate cash in ows largely independent of those from other assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The Groups cash-generating units are the smallest identi able groups of assets that generate cash in ows that are largely independent of the cash in ows from other assets or groups of assets.
ii REVERSALS OF IMPAIRMENT An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
h INVENTORIES Raw materials and consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a first-in first-out FIFO basis.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Cost for raw materials and consumables is the purchase price and for work in progress and nished goods is the cost of production, including the appropriate proportion of depreciation and overheads.
The cost of work in progress and nished goods is based on the weighted average cost method.
In the case of work in progress and nished goods, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 78 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 3.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
i TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are carried at original invoice price which is the fair value of the consideration receivable less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount, being the present value of expected cash ows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
j CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits held on call or with maturities less than three months at inception and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigni cant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts.
k BORROWINGS Borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
l EMPLOYEE BENEFITS i LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS Kazakhmys LLC provides long-term employee bene ts to employees before, on and after retirement, in accordance with a labour union agreement.
Such bene ts are valued consistent with an unfunded fide ned bene t plan in accordance with IAS 19, Employee Bene ts.
The agreement provides for one-time retirement grants, financial aid, dental care, medical bene ts, sanatorium visits, annual financial support to pensioners, free tickets for city buses, privilege tickets for shuttle buses and funeral aid.
The agreement in Germany provides for part-time work for older employees.
There are no employee bene ts provided in the United Kingdom.
The future bene t that employees have earned is discounted to determine the present value.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups bene t obligations.
The calculation is performed by a quali ed actuary.
The Group recognises actuarial gains and losses falling outside a corridor of the greater of 10% of the bene t obligation or 10% of the assets, amortised over the expected average future working lifetime of employees in the arrangements.
The expense in relation to these long-term employee bene ts is charged to the income statement so as to match the cost of providing these bene ts to the period of service of the employees.
ii SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Certain employees of the Group receive part of their remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured at fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value of share awards with market-related vesting conditions are determined by an external consultant and the fair value at the grant date are expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each balance sheet date up to the vesting date at which point the estimate is adjusted to re ect the current expectations.
No adjustment is made to the fair value after the vesting date even if the awards are forfeited or not exercised.
iii TRUST ACTIVITIES Assets held in trust or in a duciary capacity are not treated as assets of the Group and, accordingly, are not included in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions entered into with these trust activities are expensed in the consolidated financial statements.
iv SOCIAL PROGRAMMES The Group is obliged to contribute towards social programmes for the bene t of the local community at large.
The Groups contributions towards these programmes are expensed to the income statement as incurred.
m PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that re ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci c to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued i SITE RESTORATION COSTS Site restoration provisions are made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure and restoration, and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in finance costs.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future bene t and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations.
ii RESTRUCTURING A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided.
iii OTHER Other provisions are accounted for when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation for which it is probable there will be an out ow of resources, for which the amount can be reliably estimated.
n REVENUE Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic bene ts will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue associated with the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when all signi cant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has passed to the customer.
Almost all sales agreements for copper cathodes and copper rods provide for provisional pricing of sales in the month of sale with final pricing settlement based on the average LME copper price for the month following the sale.
Sales which remain open to final pricing at year end are valued at provisional prices.
Sales are subsequently adjusted for the final pricing settlement when closed out in the following year.
Revenue excludes any applicable sales taxes.
Mining royalties are included within cost of sales.
o FINANCE INCOME Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested and foreign exchange gains.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, calculated in accordance with the effective interest rate method.
p FINANCE COSTS Finance costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, the accumulation of interest on provisions and foreign exchange losses.
All interest and other costs incurred in connection with borrowings are expensed as incurred as part of finance costs.
q INCOME TAX Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Excess pro ts tax is treated as income tax and forms part of the income tax expense.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: those arising on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting pro t nor taxable pro t or loss: investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred excess pro ts tax is calculated with respect to temporary differences in respect of assets allocated to contracts for subsoil use at the expected rate of excess pro ts tax to be paid under the contract.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro ts will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax bene t will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued r DIVIDENDS Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
s FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS i RECOGNITION The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
ii MEASUREMENT When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the income statement.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices on the trade date.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
The Group classi es investments depending upon the intent of management at the time of the purchase.
Investments with xed maturities and xed or determinable payments that management has both the positive intent, and the ability to hold to maturity are classi ed as held-to-maturity.
Financial assets at fair value through pro t or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through pro t or loss.
Assets held for trading are financial assets held for short term trading purposes, and are measured at fair value through pro t or loss.
Loans and receivables are loans and receivables created by the Group providing money to a debtor.
Loans and receivables comprise loans and advances other than purchased loans.
Held-to-maturity investments and originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Available for sale investments are non-derivative financial assets and include investments that are for sale, although there is no timeframe in which management is required to sell them.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date, in which case they are included within current assets.
These assets are recorded at fair value with the unrealised movements in fair value being recognised directly in equity until disposal or sale, at which time, those unrealised movements from prior periods are recognised in pro t or loss.
If an available for sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost net of any principal payment and amortisation and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognised in pro t or loss, is transferred from equity to pro t or loss.
Reversals of impairment in respect of equity instruments classi ed as available for sale are not recognised in pro t or loss.
Commodity futures are initially recognised at fair value.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
iii DERECOGNITION A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished.
Held-to-maturity instruments and originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 81 4. BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS a EURASIA GOLD INC. On 5 July 2007 the Group acquired 96.34% of the ordinary shares of Eurasia Gold Inc. Eurasia Gold a company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Since the offer was accepted by holders of more than 90% of the Eurasia Gold shares, Kazakhmys Gold Inc. an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary of Kazakhmys PLC exercised its right under the compulsory acquisition provisions of the Business Corporations Act British Columbia to acquire the outstanding Eurasia Gold shares not already owned by Kazakhmys Gold Inc. at the same price of CA$0.85 for each Eurasia Gold share.
On 12 September 2007, the Group completed the compulsory acquisition, thereby taking its interest in Eurasia Gold to 100%.
The principal activity of Eurasia Gold and its subsidiaries is the mining and processing of gold ore into gold dor.
Eurasia Gold was purchased for a total consideration of $270.9 million in cash.
At the acquisition date, the net identi able assets and liabilities of Eurasia Gold, including fair value adjustments, were as follows: Carrying value at acquisition Fair value Fair value $ million date adjustments at acquisition Assets 1 Property, plant and equipment 8.6 0.2 8.4 1 Mining assets 7.6 231.0 238.6 1 Other assets 2.0 2.0 2 Inventories 11.2 4.1 15.3 Trade and other receivables 9.0 9.0 Cash and cash equivalents 11.6 11.6 Liabilities 3 Deferred tax liability 46.8 46.8 Provisions 1.2 1.2 Loans and borrowings 9.2 3.3 5.9 Trade and other payables 4.0 4.0 Net identi able assets 35.6 189.4 225.0 4 Goodwill arising on purchase 45.9 Purchase consideration paid 270.9 1 Fair value adjustments have been made to re ect the fair values of land and buildings, plant and machinery, reserves and resources and other exploration and development projects.
2 Inventories have been revalued to their net realisable value.
3 The increase in the deferred tax liability largely re ects the tax effect of the fair value adjustments.
4 Goodwill has been recognised as a consequence of the requirement to recognise a deferred tax liability on the fair value adjustments.
From the date of acquisition, Eurasia Gold has contributed an after tax loss of $2.1 million to the net pro t of the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the net pro t of the Group would have been $4.1 million lower at $1,422.6 million and revenues would have been $11.9 million higher at $5,268.5 million.
b ZhREK JSC In February 2006, the Group acquired 90% of ZhREK JSC, a power transmission company in Kazakhstan, for $2.3 million.
The fair value of the net identi able assets was $9.8 million, minority interests were $1.0 million and negative goodwill on acquisition was $6.5 million.
Upon acquisition, the Group acquired cash of $0.3 million.
SEGMENT INFORMATION A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services in a particular business sector business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups primary basis of segmentation in business segments, which are based on the Groups management and internal reporting structures.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise corporate head of ce assets and liabilities, borrowings, income taxes payable, deferred taxes and dividends payable receivable.
The Groups principal operations are based in Kazakhstan, with MKM being based in Germany.
KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 82 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 5.
SEGMENT INFORMATION continued The Groups activities principally relate to: Kazakhmys Copper operations which involve the production and sale of: copper cathodes and copper rod, zinc metal and zinc metal in concentrate, gold and silver, and other by-products lead, rhenium, selenium, cadmium and sulphuric acid : Kazakhstan and Central Asia gold production, exploration and development activity: Kazakhstan oil and gas exploration and development activity: German copper processing operation.
Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.
Segmental information relating to employees is provided in note 8. a BUSINESS SEGMENTS In the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group operated the following four business segments: KAZAKHMYS COPPER PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS KAZAKH MINING The Kazakhmys Copper business, which involves the processing and sale of copper and other metals, is managed as one business segment.
The products are subject to the same risks and returns, exhibit similar long-term financial performance and are sold through the same distribution channels.
The Group processes substantially all the copper ore it produces and utilises most of the copper concentrate it processes.
The Group has a number of activities that exist solely to support the mining operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation.
These other activities generate less than 10% of total revenues both external and internal and the related assets are less than 10% of total assets.
The UK operation consists of two functions: a trading function responsible for the purchases of products from the Kazakhmys Copper operations, application of an appropriate mark-up and then onward sale to third parties: and a corporate head of ce function.
For the purposes of business segmental reporting, the trading function is regarded as a sales function on behalf of the Kazakhmys Copper business and consequently the assets and liabilities related to those trading operations, i. e. trade creditors and trade receivables, are included within the Kazakhmys Copper business segment.
The expenses, assets and liabilities of the corporate head of ce function are disclosed separately as unallocated items.
The price at which sales are made to the Company by Kazakhmys LLC is based on the prevailing price of commodities as determined by the LME.
KAZAKHMYS GOLD In September 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of Eurasia Gold Inc. see note 4.
The principal activities of Eurasia Gold subsequently renamed Kazakhmys Gold and its subsidiaries is the mining and processing of gold ore into re ned ore and exploration and development activity in the precious metal sector within the Central Asia region.
KAZAKHMYS PETROLEUM In April 2007, the Group acquired Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP previously called Dostan-Temir LLP, a company which holds a licence to conduct oil and gas exploration and development activity in the East Akzhar exploration block in western Kazakhstan.
MKM MKM operates in Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy seminished products.
MKM faces different risks to the Groups other businesses and is therefore shown as a separate business segment.
In the year ended 31 December 2006, the Group operated two business segments: Kazakhmys Copper and MKM.

There is no time restriction over the utilisation of tax losses.
Due to the past history of tax losses, there is insuf cient certainty that a taxable pro t will arise against which the losses can be offset.
For these reasons no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
ii UNITED KINGDOM The payment of the dividends from Kazakhmys LLC to the Company has created excess foreign tax credits of $55.2 million 2006: $12.4 million which have arisen due to the higher effective tax rate in Kazakhstan compared to the UK as well as withholding taxes payable on dividends remitted from Kazakhstan to the UK.
These excess foreign tax credits do not expire.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS During the year the Company established a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and a Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP.
The total expense for the year ended 31 December 2007 arising from these plans was $0.1 million.
Both plans are discretionary bene ts offered by the Company for the bene t of certain of its employees.
Details of these plans are set out on page 59. a LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN Under the LTIP, awards over the Companys shares are granted to senior management of the Company at nil cost.
The vesting of the awards is dependent on the total shareholder return TSR of the Group as compared to a group of listed comparator companies.
The first awards, granted on 3 December 2007, under the LTIP were made with either a two year vesting period or a three year vesting period.
Awards over 11,226 shares were granted with a two year vesting period, and awards over 37,862 shares were granted with a three year vesting period.
The fair value of the share awards was estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the shares were granted.
This model simulates the TSR and compares it against the group of comparator companies.
It takes into account historic dividends and share price uctuations to predict the distribution of relative share performance.
The following table shows the movements in the number of awards over shares during the year: Number 2007 Outstanding at 1 January 2007 Granted on 3 December 2007 2 year vesting period 11,226 Granted on 3 December 2007 3 year vesting period 37,862 Outstanding at 31 December 2007 49,088 Exercisable at 31 December 2007 KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 106 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 26.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS continued The following table lists the inputs to the model: Shares Shares granted granted with a with a 2 year 3 year vesting vesting period period 2007 2007 Number of awards 11,226 37,862 Fair value at grant date 7.326 7.704 Share price at grant date 13.45 13.45 Exercise price nil nil Expected volatility 42.1% 41.7% Expected weighted average life at 31 December 2007 1.9 years 2.9 years The award of shares are not affected by the risk free rate of interest since no investment is required by the recipient, and therefore no interest could be earned elsewhere.
On vesting of the award, the participants are entitled to cash equal to the value of dividends excluding the dividend tax credit that would have been paid on those shares between the grant date and the date of vesting.
Therefore, expected dividend yield does not affect the valuation of the awards and has been set at zero to achieve this effect.
Expected volatility is based on historic share price movements.
b DEFERRED SHARE BONUS PLAN Shares under the DSBP are due to be granted to employees in March 2008 based on the deferred amount of an employees 2007 cash bonus.
The number of shares granted to employees will be based on the cash value of the deferred bonus and the average share price for a period of time prior to grant date in March 2008.
The shares granted will normally be released after a period of two years after grant date, i. e. in March 2010.
At 31 December 2007, the cash value of shares eligible for the DSBP, for which shares will be granted in March 2008, was $0.4 million.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES The Groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and current investments.
The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 3.
The Group does not speculate in financial instruments.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and liabilities as fide ned in IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation.
a DERIVATIVES, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT In general, the Group does not use derivative instruments or financial instruments to manage its exposure to uctuations in foreign currency rates, interest rates and commodity prices, with the exception of MKM, where limited commodity futures are used to manage its exposure to copper prices.
b FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that companys functional currency.
The functional currency of Kazakhmys LLC, Kazakhmys Gold and Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP is the Kazakhstan tenge, with MKM having a Euro functional currency and the Company having a US dollar functional currency.
The currencies giving rise to this foreign currency risk are primarily the US dollar based revenues, bank deposits, trade receivables and certain trade payables of Kazakhmys LLC, subsidiary companies within Kazakhmys Gold and Kazakhmys Petroleum LLP and the US dollar balances in respect of certain revenues, and trade receivables and payables of MKM.
The Group generally does not enter into hedging positions in respect of its exposure to foreign currency risk.
i FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COMPANY PROFILE The analysis in the table below of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Groups exposure to currencies other than the functional currency of a company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.

c COMMODITY PRICE RISK The Group is exposed to the effect of uctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of copper prices in the future.
A one per cent increase decrease of commodity prices would have increased decreased pro t loss after tax by the amounts shown below.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant.

MKM uses natural hedging arising on back-to-back purchase and supply contracts to manage its economic exposure to changes in the price of copper.
In those limited cases where a natural hedge is not possible, MKM uses commodity futures to manage its exposure to changes in the price of copper.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued d CREDIT RISK The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
It is the Groups policy that credit evaluations are performed on all customers, who wish to trade on credit terms whereby they require credit over a certain amount.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Credit risk relating to the Groups other financial assets, comprising principally current investments and cash and cash equivalents, arises from the potential default of counterparties.
Management regularly monitors the financial strength of counterparties through its knowledge of local market conditions.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
As at 31 December 2007, 11 2006: 6 customers accounted for 47% 2006: 65% of the trade and other receivables balance of the Group.
By 5 March 2008, 95% 14 March 2006: 100% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.
i EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: $ million 2007 2006 Available for sale investments 2,401.0 Other non-current investments long-term bank deposits 2.1 1.6 Other non-current investments long-term securities 4.6 3.8 Trade and other receivables 332.9 263.5 Current investments short-term bank deposits 57.3 1,186.7 Current investments assets held for trading 50.5 Cash and cash equivalents 438.5 785.4 3,236.4 2,291.5 ii RISK FOR TRADE RECEIVABLES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December by geographic areas was: $ million 2007 2006 Europe 147.6 144.0 China 101.5 54.0 Kazakhstan 46.8 38.6 Other 37.0 26.9 332.9 263.5 iii IMPAIRMENT LOSSES The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: 2007 2006 $ million Gross Impairment Gross Impairment Not past due 293.2 230.5 Past due 0-90 days 36.4 1.4 31.7 2.1 Past due 91-180 days 3.0 0.7 2.5 0.5 Past due 181-270 days 3.2 0.8 2.5 1.3 More than 270 days 30.1 30.1 24.9 24.7 365.9 33.0 292.1 28.6 KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 11 3 33.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued The movement in the provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: $ million 2007 2006 At 1 January 28.6 32.7 Charged credited to income statement 2.3 8.3 Written off 1.6 Net exchange adjustment 3.7 4.2 At 31 December 33.0 28.6 e PRICE RISK The Group holds German securities on behalf of employees in order to fund its obligations arising from part-time contracts for older employees note 27.
These securities amounted to $1.5 million as at 31 December 2007 2006: $2.7 million.
The Group is therefore exposed to uctuations in the market price of these securities.
f LIQUIDITY RISK The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of liquid cash investments of varying maturities, credit facilities and longer term debt instruments.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
In the event that bank term deposits in Kazakhstan need to be liquidated at short notice in advance of their contracted maturity date, the terms of these investments permit their immediate conversion to cash, and in some instances, the forfeiture of interest accrued to the date of liquidation.

Changes in interest rates impacting borrowings change either their fair value xed rate debt or their future cash ows variable rate debt.
The Groups policy is to generally borrow at oating rate of interest wherever possible and financial instruments are used to swap material xed rate exposure to oating where necessary.
However, local market conditions in Kazakhstan dictate that borrowings are generally xed in nature and as such, borrowings in Kazakhstan are generally short term in nature and used for working capital purposes only.
Interest on financial instruments classi ed as oating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classi ed as xed rate is xed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the tables below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued ii INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY PROFILE The following tables set out the carrying amount, by currency, of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk: At 31 December 2007 $ million US dollar Euro KZT UK sterling Total Fixed rate 1 Non-current investments 0.1 5.1 5.2 Current investments 50.0 7.3 57.3 2 Cash and cash equivalents 154.6 154.6 Borrowings 1.6 1.6 203.1 12.4 215.5 Floating rate 1 Non-current investments 1.5 1.5 2 Cash and cash equivalents 248.3 248.3 Borrowings 195.9 195.9 248.3 194.4 53.9 At 31 December 2006 $ million US dollar Euro KZT UK sterling Total Fixed rate 1 Non-current investments 0.5 2.2 2.7 Current investments 1,055.7 114.0 67.5 1,237.2 2 Cash and cash equivalents 478.7 478.7 1,534.9 114.0 69.7 1,718.6 Floating rate 1 Non-current investments 2.7 2.7 2 Cash and cash equivalents 220.4 11.9 0.5 232.8 Borrowings 277.3 277.3 220.4 262.7 0.5 41.8 1 Non-current investments excludes non-interest bearing unlisted investments of $7.1 million 2006: $2.3 million.
A one per cent increase decrease in interest rates on oating rate net assets liabilities would have decreased increased pro t after tax by $0.3 million and equity by $nil on the basis that all other variables, in particular monetary assets and liabilities impacted by oating rates remain constant.
h FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES For those investments which are actively traded on the stock exchange the fair value is based on market prices.
In other cases fair value has been determined as at the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
As a result of this exercise, the Directors have determined that the fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, comprising cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, current and non-current investments, trade and other payables, borrowings, income tax and dividends payable, approximates to the carrying amounts.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities are summarised in the following table: 2007 2006 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair $ million value value value value Available for sale investments 2,401.0 2,401.0 Other non-current investments unlisted investments 5.5 5.5 0.8 0.8 Other non-current investments long-term securities 4.6 4.6 3.8 3.8 Other non-current investments long-term bank deposits 2.1 2.1 1.6 1.6 Trade and other receivables 332.9 330.7 263.5 262.0 Current investments short-term bank deposits 57.3 57.3 1,186.7 1,186.7 Current investments assets held for trading 50.5 50.5 Cash and cash equivalents 438.5 438.5 785.4 785.4 Borrowings 197.5 197.5 277.3 277.3 Trade and other payables 224.3 223.4 330.4 329.4 Income tax payable 65.3 64.8 176.9 174.1 Dividend payable 2.1 2.1 4.4 4.4 KAZAKHMYS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2007 Financial Statements 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2007 33.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES continued i CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains a robust balance sheet in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups current capital structure is almost exclusively equity with minimal levels of debt carried within the MKM and Kazakhmys Gold businesses for working capital purposes.
The Kazakhmys Copper business is debt free.
The Group is in a strong cash position and, with copper trading well above historic price levels, the Group generates considerable Free Cash Flow in excess of current capital and growth requirements.
Carrying signi cant cash balances is not the most ef cient use of capital, and therefore in 2007, the Group returned excess cash to shareholders through a combination of raising ordinary dividends, paying a special dividend and undertaking a share buy-back programme.
Further returns to shareholders will be assessed in future taking into consideration commodity prices and capital requirements for organic and acquisitive growth at the time.
This will ensure the Group maintains an ef cient capital structure that meet the needs of the business and maximises shareholder value.
At 31 December 2007, capital employed comprised of equity shareholders funds, minority interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $6,630.7 million, compared to $4,169.1 million at 31 December 2006.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a LEGAL CLAIMS In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2007 and 2006 the Group was not involved in any signi cant legal proceedings, including arbitration.
b KAZAKHSTAN TAXATION CONTINGENCIES i INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN INTERPRETING TAX LEGISLATION The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
The tax system and tax legislation in Kazakhstan have been in force for only a relatively short time and are subject to frequent changes and varying interpretations.
Managements interpretations of such legislation in applying it to business transactions of the Group may be challenged by the relevant tax authorities and, as a result, the Group may be assessed on additional tax payments including fines, penalties and interest charges, which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
Such uncertainties may in particular relate to the valuation of the taxable base for excess pro ts tax purposes and the application of transfer pricing policies.
In relation to excess pro ts tax, the tax law gives no explicit guidance on how the tax base should be determined for individual subsurface use contracts relevant to certain members of the Group.
Prior to 2002 it was not clear from the contracts themselves as to how pro tability should be allocated to the Groups mining operations.
In the event of a successful challenge by the tax authorities, the Group may be liable for additional payments of excess pro ts tax.
Depending on the interpretation adopted and the amounts, if any, that are involved, this could have a signi cant adverse impact on the Groups financial position and on its pro t for a reporting period.
Under such circumstances, there would also be a consequential signi cant adverse impact on all subsequent periods due to the cumulative nature of the excess pro ts tax calculations.
ii STATUS OF TAX AUDITS During 2006, Kazakhmys LLC was subject to a tax audit for the periods 2003 to 2005 and received a tax assessment for approximately $11 million, including penalties and interest.
Kazakhmys LLC paid this amount to the tax authorities in March 2007.
The issuance of the tax audit act following this audit implicitly con rmed managements approach to excess pro ts tax for the years subject to audit.
The cumulative nature of excess pro ts tax calculations may result in a further assessment of excess pro ts tax for the years already subject to audit if subsequent tax audits challenge the methodology adopted by Kazakhmys LLC.
However, management believes the excess pro ts tax methodology adopted by Kazakhmys LLC is in compliance with legislation, and interpretations thereof.
During 2007, Kazakhmys LLC was subject to a transfer pricing audit for the years 2001 to 2005 and received a tax assessment for approximately $21 million, including penalties and interest.
Kazakhmys LLC paid this amount to the tax authorities in August 2007.
Based on the results of this audit, management has also evaluated that the potential tax exposure for the years 2006 and 2007 would be approximately $28 million if the same methodology applied by the tax authorities for the years 2001 to 2005 was applied to 2006 and 2007.
Kazakhmys LLC paid $13 million of this potential exposure in December 2007 and will pay the balance of $15 million to the tax authorities by April 2008.
The Group has fully provided in its financial statements for all potential tax liabilities relating to application of transfer pricing policies assuming the approach adopted by the tax authorities in future tax audits is consistent with that which has been applied in prior years.
iii PERIOD FOR ADDITIONAL TAX ASSESSMENTS The tax authorities are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess pro ts tax.
In respect of the excess pro ts tax they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
iv POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES continued The resulting effect of this matter is that additional tax liabilities may arise.
However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practicable for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
c GERMAN TAXATION CONTINGENCIES i STATUS OF TAX AUDITS In 2007 the German tax authorities nalised a tax audit of MKM for the years 1999 to 2002.
The years from 2003 to 2007 remain open for inspection.
Consequently, the tax gures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
ii PAYMENTS OF FUTURE UTILISED TAX LOSSES In accordance with the privatisation agreement between the successor body of the former state-controlled shareholder in MKM, BMBG  Berlin GmbH BMGB and Lamitref Holding B. V. former owner in MKM, dated 18 December 1995, to the extent that MKM utilised tax losses against taxable income, it was required to make certain agreed upon payments to BMGB.
The maximum payment that was payable to BMGB was $115.5 million.
However, in 2007, MKM reached agreement with the German government, whereby all losses accumulated prior to May 1999 were forfeited with losses after this date being retained by MKM.
Therefore, no future payments are required to be made to BMBG subsequent to this agreement, as the losses accumulated prior to May 1999, are no longer available to MKM.
d INSURANCE The insurance industry in Kazakhstan is in a developing state and many forms of insurance protection common in other parts of the world are not yet generally available.
The Group has purchased a catastrophic insurance programme in the London market to mitigate the effect of the loss or damage of certain of its assets located at its plant facilities and the resultant business interruption although such a programme may not provide full cover in the event of a major loss.
The Group does not have third party liability coverage in respect of property or environmental damage arising from accidents on Group property or relating to Group operations.
There is a risk that the loss or destruction of certain assets could have a material adverse effect on the Groups operations and financial position.
e ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving.
The outcome of the environmental regulations under proposed or any future environmental legislation cannot be estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no signi cant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 28, is based upon the estimation of Kazakhmys LLCs and Kazakhmys Golds specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
f USE OF SUBSOIL AND EXPLORATION RIGHTS In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2025. g OBLIGATIONS TO PENSION FUND BENEFICIARIES The pension scheme is run by ABN Amro Bank Kazakhstan, and is termed the Accumulating Pension Fund of Kazakhmys Corporation LLC the Fund.
The Fund is a corporate accumulative pension fund established under the laws of Kazakhstan.
Most of Kazakhmys LLCs employees and former employees are bene ciaries, and are entitled to an amount comprising the indexed value of their contributions.
Under Kazakhstan law, the Fund calculates the bene ts of its members on an annual basis.
Kazakhmys LLC does not make any contributions to the Fund on behalf of its employees.
The Funds rules set out that the payment obligation to Fund bene ciaries is based on the nominal value of contributions, indexed in accordance with a formula set out in the Funds rules.
In the event that the assets of the Fund are insuf cient to cover the payment obligations to the bene ciaries, the voting shareholders of the Fund including Kazakhmys LLC are jointly liable for the shortfall.
The last valuation as at 31 December 2007 showed the Funds payment obligations were $191.4 million 2006: $134.0 million, and the fair market value of the Funds assets amounted to $208.8 million 2006: $158.1 million.
h COMMITMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE ACQUISITION OF MKM In the context of its acquisition of MKM in December 2004, the Group is committed to invest approximately $43.0 million in capital expenditure by 31 December 2008, and inject working capital of $37.0 million and ensure that MKM employs at least 1,006 employees up to 31 December 2006.
As at 31 December 2007, $43.9 million 2006: $18.1 million had been invested in capital expenditure in MKM since acquisition.
The average number of employees during the year ended 31 December 2007 was 1,045 2006: 1,045.

Committed expenditure under these subsoil agreements relates to investments in community-related projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities.
j GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYEE LOANS Kazakhmys LLCs employees are permitted to enter into loan arrangements with banks on normal commercial terms under which Kazakhmys LLC has guaranteed to deduct repayments from employees remuneration in accordance with agreed schedules of repayment.
The total value of this guarantee amounted to $6.2 million as at 31 December 2007 2006: $1.2 million.
k OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS At 31 December 2007, the Group and Company had the following total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases: $ million 2007 2006 Within one year 2.0 0.9 After one year but not more than five years 7.8 7.3 More than five years 16.2 17.0 26.0 25.2 35.

i OPTION AGREEMENT WITH CHAIRMAN Following approval of the transaction from the independent shareholders on 19 October 2007, and receipt of regulatory approval from the Government, the Group exercised the call option over Vladimir Kims interest in Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation PLC ENRC for a total consideration of $806.3 million on 26 October 2007.
This represented 100% of the initial investment of $751 million plus a 10% margin re ecting the risk of the initial investment and the actual nancing and transaction costs incurred by Vladimir Kim less any dividends paid to him as a result of holding the stake.
ii COMPANIES UNDER TRUST MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS The Group operates a number of companies under trust management agreements with local and state authorities.
The activities include heating distribution systems, road maintenance and aviation services.
The purpose of these agreements is to provide public and social services without any material financial bene t for the Group.
Transactions between the Group and these companies are conducted on an arms length basis.
iii OTHER COMPANIES Transactions with other companies primarily relate to the provision of goods and services, on an arms length basis, from companies whose Boards include members of senior management of the Groups subsidiaries in signi cant roles.

On 31 January 2006, the Company made a capital contribution of $185.7 million to Kazakhmys LLC.
The offer period for subscribing shareholders to take up the right of minority interests who did not participate in the capital contribution, as permitted by legislation, closed on 14 March 2006.
The Company also acquired minority shareholders interests who did not participate in the capital contribution at a cost of $1.1 million during the year.
The Companys interest in Kazakhmys LLC therefore increased from 98.68% as at 1 January 2006 to 99.08% at 31 December 2006.
In September 2007 the Company issued 2,559,665 ordinary shares of 20 pence each and paid $11.5 million in consideration for the transfer to it of 227,959,211 units in Kazakhmys LLC by minority shareholders.
