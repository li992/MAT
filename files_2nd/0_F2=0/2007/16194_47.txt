86 Tullow Oil plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 100 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances.
The Hardman Bridge Facility is a US$550 million 275.4 million facility which is currently repayable in full on 31 January 2009.
Tranche A of the facility is a US$150 million 75.1 million revolving tranche which incurs interest on outstanding debt at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 250 basis points to 350 basis points.
The margin on Tranche A increases in quarterly 25 basis point increments and is also dependent on whether certain assets are included in the security package.
Tranche B of the facility is a US$400 million 200.3 million non-revolving tranche which incurs interest on outstanding debt at US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 300 basis points to 325 basis points, depending on whether certain assets are included in the security package.
There is no requirement under the Hardman Bridge Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to US Dollar LIBOR.
The Hardman Bridge Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility, net of relevant cash balances.
At the end of December 2007, the headroom under the facilities amounted to US$457 million 228.8 million : US$307 million 153.7 million under the Borrowing Base and US$150 million 75.1 million under the Hardman Bridge Facility.
At the end of December 2006, the headroom under the two facilities was US$1.4 billion 714.6 million : US$416 million 212.3 million under the Borrowing Base and US$1 billion 502.3 million under the Hardman Bridge Facility which was not drawn down until January 2007.
In the table for 2007, 100.1 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2007 for a six-month duration.
The Group is exposed to floating rate interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates.
The Group hedges its floating rate interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis through the use of interest rate derivatives, namely interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate zero cost collars.
All interest rate derivatives currently in place were put in place for a three-year period in late 2005 and expire in November 2008.
The effect of the interest rate cap currently in place limits the exposure to US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8% for a current notional principal of US$35 million 17.5 million.
The interest rate swap currently in place has a swap rate of 4.75% for a current notional principal of US$35 million 17.5 million.
The zero cost collar currently in place has a floor of 3.475% and a cap of 5.8% for a notional principal of US$35 million 17.5 million.
The combined mark to market position as at the 2007 year end was 104,000 2006: 156,000.
As the interest rate swaps do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values, the hedged amounts are included in floating rate debt in the 2007 and 2006 table.
Foreign currency risk Wherever possible, the Group conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars all other countries, the functional currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
A natural hedge exists in the majority of the Groups oil and gas income and expenditure, which are denominated in US Dollars and Sterling respectively.
The Groups borrowing facilities are also denominated in Sterling and US Dollars, which further assists in foreign currency risk management.
From time to time the Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies.
These exposures are managed by executing foreign currency financial derivatives, typically to manage exposures arising on corporate transactions such as acquisitions and disposals.
There were no foreign currency financial derivatives in place at the 2007 year end.
Cash balances are held in other currencies to meet immediate operating and administrative expenses or to comply with local currency regulations.
As at 31 December 2007 the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Group that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$570 million 285.4 million cash drawings under the US$1,350 million 675.9 million Borrowing Base Facility and US$400 million 200.3 million cash drawings under the US$550 million 275.4 million Hardman Bridge Facility.
As at 31 December 2006 the only material assets or liabilities that were not denominated in the functional currency of the respective subsidiaries involved were US$280 million 142.9 million cash drawings under the US$850 million 425.6 million Borrowing Base facility.
These US Dollar cash drawings at 31 December 2007 continue to be held as a hedge against US Dollar denominated net assets in subsidiaries.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are 452.2 million 2006: 90.5 million.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuation in the US dollar.
The Group measures its market risk exposure by running various sensitivity analyses including 10% favourable and adverse changes in the key variables.
The sensitivity analyses include only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates.
