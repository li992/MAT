INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS continued The goodwill recognised as at 1 May 2005 on the Sx3 acquisition in the year ended 30 April 2005 has been adjusted for the following assets and liabilities which were originally omitted in error from the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired: additional PAYE NI liabilities amounting to 2.1 million together with a related deferred tax asset of 0.7 million.
0.6 million due to the overstatement of capitalised research and development costs on the acquisition balance sheet.
2.6 million in respect of the deferred tax asset impact of certain fair value adjustments which had been omitted in the acquisition balance sheet.
Overall, these adjustments have resulted in a net decrease in goodwill recognised of 606,000 as at 1 May 2005 and 30 April 2006.
There were no adjustments required in the comparative income statement, earnings per share or cash flow statement.
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Cash-generating units containing goodwill: Public Human Managed Services Resources Services Total '000 '000 '000 '000 Net book value: At 30 April 2007 116,810 237,920 34,812 389,542 At 30 April 2006 restated 102,940 209,810 34,812 347,562 At 30 April 2005 restated 102,940 207,638 34,812 345,390 Cash-generating units containing goodwill are subject to impairment reviews.
The net present value of the future cash flows of cash-generating units is reviewed in order to determine whether an impairment provision is required.
The recoverable amount of acquired cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual operating results and budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Due to the businesses acquired being of a long-term nature, cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated at a prudent flat growth rate.
A pre-tax discount rate of ten per cent has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Management believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
There were no impairments of goodwill during the year 2006: nil.
