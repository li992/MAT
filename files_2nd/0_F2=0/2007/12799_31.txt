3 Represents the movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Whilst the interest rate swaps are considered to be effective in matching the amortising profile of existing or planned floating rate borrowings, they do not meet the definition of an effective hedge due to the relative size of the mark to market difference of the swap at the date of acquisition or inception.

In the comparative period, adjustments to tax in respect of prior periods represent adjustments to current tax of 8.6m and deferred tax of 6.4m.
5 In the current period, this represents the release of a provision following the finalisation of past tax matters.
In the comparative period, the tax treatment of an onerous contract was clarified and the associated tax provision was released.
