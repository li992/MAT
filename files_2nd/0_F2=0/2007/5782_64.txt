Equity reserve The equity reserve represents the cost to the company of operating a number of share based compensation plans involving options for ordinary shares in the company.
Full details of these plans are given in note 32.
Merger reserve The premium arising on the rights issue was credited against the merger reserve.
The credit to a merger reserve rather than share premium account was made by taking advantage of merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
This relief was applicable as a result of the issue of new shares in the company for shares in a so-called cash box subsidiary.
The amount credited to merger reserve was subsequently credited to retained earnings as in the opinion of the directors the amounts credited were distributable.
Other reserves The premium arising on the issue of shares to First Reserve has been credited to other reserves by taking advantage of merger relief under Section 131 of the Companies Act 1985.
