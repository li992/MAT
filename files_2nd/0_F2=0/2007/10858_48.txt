The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is equal to the carrying value, except for available for sale investments where there is no active market.
In the absence of any other reliable external information, these assets are carried at amortised cost.
The Group has no current plans to dispose of these assets.

These instruments are summarised below: a A cash flow hedge with a total principal of US$100m that was entered into in September 2000 fixed at 6.8545% until September 2010. b A cash flow hedge with a principal of 150m that was entered into in December 2006 fixed at 3.77% until December 2008. c A cash flow hedge with a principal of 300m that was entered into in November 2007 fixed at 4.26% until August 2010. d A cash flow hedge with a principal of 150m that was entered into in December 2007 fixed at 4.24% until March 2010. e A cash flow hedge with a principal of 250m that was entered into in November 2007 fixed at 4.27% until May 2012. f An interest rate swap of US$100m that was entered into in September 2000 fixed at 6.9% and a separate US$100m interest rate swap that has the effect of fixing the accrued loss on the first swap.
These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
The net effect on the income statement is immaterial.
The conditions of all swaps remaining in place at 31 December 2007 coincide with the material conditions of the underlying loans.
The underlying cash flows are expected to take place periodically from 2008 to 2012 and will affect profit or loss over the same period of time.
The benchmark rate for floating rate financial liabilities is the relevant interbank borrowing rate.
During the year 0.2m 2006: 2.4m has been transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement in respect of interest rate swaps, no ineffectiveness was recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investments in foreign entities Included in bank loans are borrowings of US$150.0m 75.6m 2006: US$190.0m 96.9m, CAN$nil nil 2006: CAN$96.0m 41.1m and 1,145.0m 841.6m 2006: 475.0m 320.0m which have been designated as a hedge of net investments in the foreign currency denominated net assets of the Group and are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
In addition the Group has synthetic debt in the form of foreign currency forward contracts in place split between US$283.8m 143.0m 2006: US$185.0m 94.4m, CAN$192.1m 97.1m 2006: CAN$150.0m 65.7m, AUD$nil nil 2006: AUD$72.0m 29.0m and 160.0m 117.6m 2006: 200.5m 135.1m to complete the post-tax hedge of the net investment in foreign entities.
The portion of the gain or loss on the foreign currency forward contracts that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity and, to this extent, offsets any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries.
No ineffectiveness has been recognised in the income statement.
Fuel price hedges The Group has a number of fuel price swaps in place to hedge the different types of fuel used in each division.
Ultra low sulphur diesel and gasoil as used in the UK Bus, UK Coach, UK Trains and European Coach & Bus divisions are hedged by swaps in the same type of fuel.
Diesel used in the North American division is hedged by heating oil swaps.
The timing of the swap cash flows will match the underlying fuel purchases during 2008 and 2009.
During the year 0.8m 2006: 0.8m has been transferred from the hedging reserve, of which a 4.3m debit 2006: 6.7m was recognised in the hedging reserve at 1 January 2007 and the remainder was generated during the year due to the movement in market fuel prices.
Fuel price swaps can be analysed as follows: 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 2007 2006 Volume Volume m m million litres million litres Sterling denominated fuel swaps UK Bus, UK Coach and UK Trains 4.7 1.6 57.0 131.5 US dollar denominated fuel swaps North American Bus 1.5 1.5 23.3 45.4 Euro denominated fuel swaps European Coach & Bus 2.3 1.2 48.8 44.4 Fuel price swaps included in current assets liabilities 8.5 4.3 129.1 221.3 Sterling denominated fuel swaps UK Bus, UK Coach and UK Trains 1.7 0.7 24.0 72.0 US dollar denominated fuel swaps North American Bus 0.4 0.9 11.4 34.6 Euro denominated fuel swaps European Coach & Bus 1.5 1.0 34.5 58.8 Fuel price swaps included in non-current assets liabilities 3.6 2.6 69.9 165.4 Total fuel price swaps 12.1 6.9 199.0 386.7 Interest swap at fair value through profit or loss The Group has entered into a series of one year basis swaps, where the company pays six month EURIBOR less a margin and receives one month EURIBOR.
These swaps were entered into in November 2007 and expire in November 2008.
