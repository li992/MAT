This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Certain of the groups trade receivables are funded through a securitisation facility arranged by HSBC Investment Bank plc and funded through a vehicle owned by GRE Trust Company Ireland Limited.
The facility is secured against those receivables and is without recourse to any of the groups other assets.
The finance provider will seek repayment of the finance, as to both principal and interest, only to the extent that collections from the receivables nanced allows and the benefit of additional collections remains with the group.
At the year end, receivables of 89,211,000 2006: 84,172,000 were funded through the securitisation facility.
Bank balances and cash Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Credit Risk The groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash and trade and other receivables.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
