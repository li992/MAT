Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information 1 Basis of preparation The EEV basis results have been prepared in accordance with the EEV Principles issued by the CFO Forum of European Insurance Companies in May 2004 and expanded by the Additional Guidance on EEV Disclosures published in October 2005.
Where appropriate the EEV basis results include the effects of adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The EEV results for the Group are prepared for covered business as defined by the EEV Principles.
Covered business represents the Groups long-term insurance business for which the value of new and in-force contracts is attributable to shareholders.
The EEV basis results for the Groups covered business are then combined with the IFRS basis results of the Groups other operations.
These other operations include the results of discontinued banking operations, following the sale of Egg on 1 May 2007.
The definition of long-term business operations is consistent with previous practice and comprises those contracts falling under the definition of long-term insurance business for regulatory purposes together with, for US operations, contracts that are in substance the same as guaranteed investment contracts GICs but do not fall within the technical definition.
Under the EEV Principles, the results for covered business incorporate the projected margins of attaching internal asset management.
With two principal exceptions, covered business comprises the Groups long-term business operations.
The principal exceptions are for the closed Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF and for the presentational treatment of the financial position of two of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
A very small amount of UK group pensions business is also not modelled for EEV reporting purposes.
SAIF is a ring-fenced sub-fund of the Prudential Assurance Company PAC long-term fund, established by a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997.
SAIF is closed to new business and the assets and liabilities of the fund are wholly attributable to the policyholders of the fund.
In 2006, a bulk annuity arrangement between SAIF and Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL, a shareholder-owned subsidiary, took place as explained in note 5a.
Reflecting the altered economic interest for SAIF policyholders and Prudential shareholders, this arrangement represents a transfer from long-term business of the Group that is not covered to business that is covered with consequential effect on the EEV basis results.
As regards the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, the surplus or deficit attaching to the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS and Scottish Amicable Pension Scheme are excluded from the EEV value of UK operations and included in the total for Other operations.
The surplus and deficit amounts are partially attributable to the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed long-term business and partially to other parts of the Group.
In addition to the IFRS basis surplus or deficit, the shareholders 10 per cent share of the PAC with-profits funds interest in the movement on the financial position of the schemes is recognised for EEV reporting purposes.
The directors are responsible for the preparation of the supplementary information in accordance with the EEV Principles.
2 Methodology a Embedded value Overview The embedded value is the present value of the shareholders interest in the earnings distributable from assets allocated to covered business after sufficient allowance has been made for the aggregate risks in that business.
The shareholders interest in the Groups long-term business comprises: present value of future shareholder cash flows from in-force covered business value of in-force business, less a deduction for the cost of locked-in encumbered capital: locked-in encumbered capital: and shareholders net worth in excess of encumbered capital.
The value of future new business is excluded from the embedded value.
Notwithstanding the basis of presentation of results as explained in notes 4 and 6 no smoothing of market or account balance values, unrealised gains or investment returns is applied in determining the embedded value or the profit before tax.
Value of in-force business The embedded value results are prepared incorporating best estimate assumptions about all relevant factors including levels of future investment returns, expenses, persistency and mortality.
These assumptions are used to project future cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows is then calculated using a discount rate which reflects both the time value of money and the non-diversifiable risks associated with the cash flows that are not otherwise allowed for.
The total profit that emerges over the lifetime of an individual contract as calculated using the embedded value basis is the same as that calculated under the IFRS basis.
Since the embedded value basis reflects discounted future cash flows, under this methodology the profit emergence is advanced thus more closely aligning the timing of the recognition of profits with the efforts and risks of current management actions, particularly with regard to business sold during the year.
306 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 2 Methodology continued Cost of capital A charge is deducted from the embedded value for the cost of capital supporting the Groups long-term business.
This capital is referred to as encumbered capital.
The cost is the difference between the nominal value of the capital and the discounted value of the projected releases of this capital allowing for investment earnings net of tax on the capital.
The annual result is affected by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit and generally a release in respect of the reduction in capital requirements for business in force as this runs off.
Where capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in this fund is already discounted to reflect their release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of encumbered capital.
However, where business is funded directly by shareholders, the capital requires adjustment to reflect the cost of that capital to shareholders.
Financial options and guarantees Nature of options and guarantees in Prudentials long-term business Asian operations Subject to local market circumstances and regulatory requirements, the guarantee features described below in respect of UK business broadly apply to similar types of participating contracts principally written in the PAC Hong Kong branch, Singapore and Malaysia.
Participating products have both guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements.
Non-participating long-term products are the only ones where the insurer is contractually obliged to provide guarantees on all benefits.
The most significant book of non-participating business in the Groups Asian operations is Taiwans whole of life contracts.
For these contracts there are floor levels of policyholder benefits that accrue at rates set at inception by reference to minimum returns established by local regulation.
These rates do not vary subsequently with market conditions.
Under these contracts the cost of premiums are also fixed at inception based on a number of assumptions at that time, including long-term interest rates, mortality assumptions and expenses.
The guaranteed maturity and surrender values reflect the pricing basis.
US operations Jackson The principal options and guarantees in Jackson are associated with the fixed annuity and Variable Annuity VA lines of business.
Fixed annuities provide that, at Jacksons discretion, it may reset the interest rate credited to policyholders accounts, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
The guaranteed minimum return varies from 1.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent 2006: 1.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent, depending on the particular product, jurisdiction where issued, and date of issue.
At 31 December 2007, 80 per cent 2006: 70 per cent of the fund relates to policies with guarantees of three per cent or less.
The average guarantee rate is 3.1 per cent 2006: 3.2 per cent.
Fixed annuities also present a risk that policyholders will exercise their option to surrender their contracts in periods of rapidly rising interest rates, possibly requiring Jackson to liquidate assets at an inopportune time.
Jackson issues VA contracts where it contractually guarantees to the contract holder either a return of no less than total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals, b total deposits made to the contract adjusted for any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return, or c the highest contract value on a specified anniversary date adjusted for any withdrawals following the contract anniversary.
These guarantees include benefits that are payable in the event of death guaranteed minimum death benefit GMDB, annuitisation guaranteed minimum income benefit GMIB, or at specified dates during the accumulation period guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit GMWB and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit GMAB.
Jackson hedges these risks using equity options and futures contracts.
These guarantees generally protect the policyholders value in the event of poor equity market performance.
Jackson also issues fixed index annuities that enable policyholders to obtain a portion of an equity-linked return while providing a guaranteed minimum return.
The guaranteed minimum returns would be of a similar nature to those described above for fixed annuities.
UK insurance operations The only significant financial options and guarantees in the UK insurance operations arise in the with-profits fund and SAIF.
With-profits products provide returns to policyholders through bonuses that are smoothed.
There are two types of bonuses: annual and final.
Annual bonuses are declared once a year and, once credited, are guaranteed in accordance with the terms of the particular product.
Unlike annual bonuses, final bonuses are guaranteed only until the next bonus declaration.
The with-profits fund held a provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 45 million 2006: 47 million at 31 December 2007 to honour guarantees on a small amount of guaranteed annuity option products.
Beyond the generic features and the provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuities described above, there are very few explicit options or guarantees of the with-profits fund such as minimum investment returns, surrender values, or annuity values at retirement and any granted have generally been at very low levels.
The Groups main exposure to guaranteed annuity options in the UK is through SAIF and a provision on the Pillar I Peak 2 basis of 563 million 2006: 561 million was held in SAIF at 31 December 2007 to honour the guarantees.
307 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 2 Methodology continued Time value The value of financial options and guarantees comprises two parts.
One is given by a deterministic valuation on best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value.
The other part arises from the variability of economic outcomes in the future the time value.
Where appropriate, a full stochastic valuation has been undertaken to determine the value of the in-force business including the cost of capital.
A deterministic valuation of the in-force business is also derived using consistent assumptions and the time value of the financial options and guarantees is derived as the difference between the two.
The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations such as equity volatility and credit losses reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of long-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with an allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details of the key characteristics of each model are given in note 3. b Level of encumbered capital In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has based encumbered capital on its internal targets for economic capital subject to it being at least the local statutory minimum requirements.
Economic capital is assessed using internal models but, when applying the EEV Principles, Prudential does not take credit for the significant diversification benefits that exist within the Group.
For with-profits business written in a segregated life fund, as is the case in Asia and the UK, the capital available in the fund is sufficient to meet the encumbered capital requirements.
Asian operations: the economic capital requirement is substantially higher than local statutory requirements in total.
Economic capital requirements vary by territory, but in aggregate, the encumbered capital is equivalent to the amount required under the Insurance Groups Directive IGD.
US operations: the level of encumbered capital has been set to an amount at least equal to 235 per cent of the risk-based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners at the Company Action Level CAL, which is sufficient to meet the economic capital requirement.
UK insurance operations: the economic capital requirements for annuity business are fully met by Pillar I requirements being four per cent of mathematical reserves, which are also sufficient to meet Pillar II requirements.
c Risk discount rates Overview Under the EEV Principles, discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows are set equal to risk-free rates plus a risk margin.
The risk margin should reflect any non-diversifiable risk associated with the emergence of distributable earnings that is not allowed for elsewhere in the valuation.
Prudential has selected a granular approach to better reflect differences in market risk inherent in each product group.
The risk discount rate so derived does not reflect a market beta but instead reflects the expected volatility associated with the cash flows in the embedded value model.
Since financial options and guarantees are explicitly valued under the EEV methodology, discount rates under EEV are set excluding the effect of these product features.
As Prudentials UK shareholder-backed annuity business is predominantly backed by fixed interest securities, the beta methodology described above is not appropriate.
We have therefore used a market consistent embedded value MCEV approach to derive an implied risk discount rate which is then applied to the projected cash flows.
In the annuity MCEV calculations, the future cash flows were discounted using the gilt yield curve plus 84 basis points for fixed annuities and 24 basis points for inflation-linked annuities 2006: gilt yield curve plus 34 basis points for both products.
The 84 basis points and 24 basis points for 2007 were based on our assessment of the liquidity premium available in the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities.
Allowance for risk The risk allowance in the risk discount rate is determined as follows: Market risk Under the Capital Asset Pricing Methodology CAPM the discount rate is determined as: Discount rate risk-free rate beta x equity risk premium Under CAPM, the beta of a portfolio or product measures its relative market risk.
The risk discount rates reflect the market risk inherent in each product group and hence the volatility of product cash flows.
They are determined by considering how the profits from each product are affected by changes in expected returns on various asset classes.
By converting this into a relative rate of return it is possible to derive a product specific beta.
308 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 2 Methodology continued Product level betas are calculated each year.
They are combined with the most recent product mix to produce appropriate betas and risk discount rates for each major product grouping.
CAPM does not include any allowance for non-market risks since these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
For EEV purposes, however, a risk margin is added for non-diversifiable non-market risks and to cover Group level risks.
Diversifiable non-market risks No allowance is required for non-market risks where these are assumed to be fully diversifiable.
The majority of non-market risks are considered to be diversifiable.
Non-diversifiable, non-market risks Finance theory cannot be used to determine the appropriate component of beta for non-diversifiable non-market risks since there is no observable risk premium associated with it that is akin to the equity risk premium.
Recognising this, a pragmatic approach has been used.
Except for UK shareholder-backed annuity business, a constant margin of 50 basis points 2006: 50 basis points has been added to the risk margin derived for market risk to cover the non-diversifiable non-market risks associated with the business.
For UK shareholder-backed annuity business, a margin of 100 basis points was used 2006: 100 basis points.
d Management actions In deriving the time value of financial options and guarantees, management actions in response to emerging investment and fund solvency conditions have been modelled.
Management actions encompass, but are not confined to, the following areas: investment allocation decisions: levels of reversionary bonuses and credited rates: and total claim values.
Bonus rates are projected from current levels and varied in accordance with assumed management actions applying in the emerging investment and fund solvency conditions.
In all instances, the modelled actions are in accordance with approved local practice and therefore reflect the options actually available to management.
For the PAC with-profits fund, the actions assumed are consistent with those set out in the Principles and Practices of Financial Management.
e With-profits business and the treatment of the estate For the PAC with-profits fund, the shareholders interest in the estate is derived by increasing final bonus rates so as to exhaust the estate over the lifetime of the in-force with-profits business.
In those few extreme scenarios where the total assets of the life fund are insufficient to meet policyholder claims in full, the excess cost is fully attributed to shareholders.
f Pension costs The Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the UK.
The principal scheme is the Prudential Staff Pension Scheme PSPS.
The other two, much smaller, schemes are the Scottish Amicable and M&G schemes.
There is also a small scheme in Taiwan.
Under IFRS the surpluses or deficits attaching to these schemes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of IAS 19.
The surpluses or deficits represent the difference between the market value of the schemes assets and the discounted value of projected future benefit payments to retired members and deferred pensioners and, to the extent of service to date, current employed members.
For PSPS the surplus or deficit at the reporting date is allocated between the PAC with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations by reference to the activities of the members of the scheme during their period of service.
At 31 December 2005, the deficit of PSPS was apportioned in the ratio 70 30 between the with-profits fund and shareholder-backed operations following detailed consideration of the sourcing of previous contributions.
This ratio was applied to the base deficit position at 1 January 2006 for the purposes of determining the allocation of the movement in that position up to 31 December 2007.
The IAS 19 service charge and ongoing employer contributions are allocated by reference to the cost allocation for current activity.
Under the EEV basis the IAS 19 basis surplus or deficit is initially allocated in the same manner.
The shareholders 10 per cent interest in the PAC with-profits fund estate is determined after inclusion of the portion of the IAS 19 basis surplus or deficit attributable to the fund.
Adjustments under EEV in respect of accounting for surpluses or deficits on defined benefit schemes are reflected as part of Other operations, as shown in note 15.
Separately, the projected cash flows of in-force covered business include contributions to the defined benefit schemes for future service based on the contribution basis applying to the schemes at the time of the preparation of the results.
309 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 2 Methodology continued g Debt capital Core structural debt liabilities are carried at market value.
3 Assumptions a Best estimate assumptions Best estimate assumptions are used for the cash flow projections, where best estimate is defined as the mean of the distribution of future possible outcomes.
The assumptions are reviewed actively and changes are made when evidence exists that material changes in future experience are reasonably certain.
Assumptions required in the calculation of the value of options and guarantees, for example relating to volatilities and correlations, or dynamic algorithms linking liabilities to assets, have been set equal to the best estimates and, wherever material and practical, reflect any dynamic relationships between the assumptions and the stochastic variables.
b Principal economic assumptions Deterministic In most countries, the long-term expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to period end rates of return on cash or fixed interest securities.
This active basis of assumption setting has been applied in preparing the results of all the Groups US and UK long-term business operations.
For the Groups Asian operations, the active basis is appropriate for business written in Japan, Korea and US dollar denominated business written in Hong Kong.
An exception to this general rule is that for countries where long-term fixed interest markets are less established, investment return assumptions and risk discount rates are based on an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Except for the countries listed above, this basis is appropriate for the Groups Asian operations.
Expected returns on equity and property asset classes in respect of each territory are derived by adding a risk premium, also based on the long-term view of Prudentials economists, to the risk-free rate.
In Asia, equity risk premiums range from 3.0 per cent to 6.0 per cent 2006: 3.0 per cent to 5.8 per cent.
In the US and the UK, the equity risk premium is 4.0 per cent above risk-free rates for both 2007 and 2006.
Best estimate assumptions for other asset classes, such as corporate bond spreads, are set consistently.
Assumed investment returns reflect the expected future returns on the assets held and allocated to the covered business at the valuation date.

ii For traditional business in Taiwan, the economic scenarios used to calculate the 2007 and 2006 EEV basis results reflect the assumption of a phased progression of the bond yields from the current rates applying to the assets held to the long-term expected rates.
The projections assume that in the average scenario, the current bond yields at 31 December 2007 of around 2.5 per cent 2006: around 2 per cent trend towards 5.5 per cent at 31 December 2013.
In projecting forward the Fund Earned Rate, allowance is made for the mix of assets in the fund, future investment strategy, and further market value depreciation of bonds held as a result of assumed future yield increases.
These factors, together with the assumption of the phased progression in bond yields, give rise to an average assumed Fund Earned Rate that trends from 0.5 per cent for 2007 to 6.4 per cent for 2014.
The assumed Fund Earned Rate increases to 2.5 per cent in 2008 and then increases to 3.3 per cent by 2013.
Thereafter, the assumed Fund Earned Rate fluctuates around a target of 6.4 per cent.
This projection compares with that applied for the 2006 results of a grading from an assumed rate of 2.1 per cent for 2006 to 5.7 per cent for 2014.
Consistent with the EEV methodology applied, a constant discount rate has been applied to the projected cash flows.
iii The assumptions shown are for US dollar denominated business which comprises the largest proportion of the in-force Hong Kong business.
iv The mean equity return assumptions for the most significant equity holdings in the Asian operations were: 31 Dec 2007 31 Dec 2006 % % Hong Kong 8.1 8.7 Malaysia 12.5 12.8 Singapore 9.3 9.3 To obtain the mean, an average over all simulations of the accumulated return at the end of the projection period is calculated.
The annual average return is then calculated by taking the root of the average accumulated return minus 1. v For 2007, cash rates rather than government bond yields were used in setting the risk discount rates for Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and for Hong Kong dollar denominated business.
For 2006, cash rates were used for these operations and for all Hong Kong business i. e. including US dollar denominated business.

iii The pre-tax rates of return for annuity business are based on the gross redemption yield on the backing assets net of a best estimate allowance for future defaults.
Stochastic The economic assumptions used for the stochastic calculations are consistent with those used for the deterministic calculations described above.
Assumptions specific to the stochastic calculations, such as the volatilities of asset returns, reflect local market conditions and are based on a combination of actual market data, historic market data and an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Common principles have been adopted across the Group for the stochastic asset models, for example, separate modelling of individual asset classes but with allowance for correlation between the various asset classes.
Details are given below of the key characteristics and calibrations of each model.
Asian operations The same asset return models as used in the UK, appropriately calibrated, have been used for the Asian operations as described for UK insurance operations below.
The principal asset classes are government and corporate bonds.
Equity holdings are much lower than in the UK whilst property holdings do not represent a significant investment asset.
The stochastic cost of guarantees is primarily only of significance for the Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan operations.
The mean stochastic returns are consistent with the mean deterministic returns for each country.
The expected volatility of equity returns for both 2007 and 2006 ranges from 18 per cent to 25 per cent and the volatility of government bond yields ranges from 1.3 per cent to 2.5 per cent 2006: 1.4 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
US operations Jackson Interest rates are projected using a log-normal generator calibrated to actual market data: Corporate bond returns are based on Treasury securities plus a spread that has been calibrated to current market conditions and varies by credit quality: and Variable annuity equity and bond returns have been stochastically generated using a regime-switching log-normal model with parameters determined by reference to historical data.
The volatility of equity fund returns for both 2007 and 2006 ranges from 18.6 per cent to 28.1 per cent, depending on risk class, and the standard deviation of bond returns ranges from 1.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent 2006: 1.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent.
312 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 3 Assumptions continued UK insurance operations Interest rates are projected using a two-factor model calibrated to actual market data: The risk premium on equity assets is assumed to follow a log-normal distribution: The corporate bond return is calculated as the return on a zero-coupon bond plus a spread.
The spread process is a mean reverting stochastic process: and Property returns are modelled in a similar fashion to corporate bonds, namely as the return on a riskless bond, plus a risk premium, plus a process representative of the change in residual values and the change in value of the call option on rents.
Mean returns have been derived as the annualised arithmetic average return across all simulations and durations.
For each projection year, standard deviations have been calculated by taking the square root of the annualised variance of the returns over all the simulations.
These have been averaged over all durations in the projection.
For equity and property, the standard deviations relate to the total return on these assets.
The standard deviations applied to both years are as follows: % Equities: UK 18.0 Overseas 16.0 Property 15.0 c Demographic assumptions Persistency, mortality and morbidity assumptions are based on an analysis of recent experience but also reflect expected future experience.
Where relevant, when calculating the time value of financial options and guarantees, policyholder withdrawal rates vary in line with the emerging investment conditions according to managements expectations.
d Expense assumptions Expense levels, including those of service companies that support the Groups long-term business operations, are based on internal expense analysis investigations and are appropriately allocated to acquisition of new business and renewal of in-force business.
Exceptional expenses are identified and reported separately.
Asia development and Regional Head Office expenses are charged to EEV basis results as incurred.
No adjustment is made to the embedded value of covered business as the amounts of expenditure that relate to operating expenses are not material.
Similarly, corporate expenditure for Group Head Office GHO, to the extent not allocated to the PAC with-profits fund, is charged to the EEV basis result as incurred.
e Inter-company arrangements The EEV results for covered business incorporate the effect of the reinsurance arrangement of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to PRIL, as described in note 5a.
In addition, the analysis of free surplus and value of in-force business takes account of the impact of contingent loan arrangements between Group companies.
f Taxation and other legislation Current taxation and other legislation have been assumed to continue unaltered except where changes have been announced and the relevant legislation passed.
g Asset management and service companies The value of future profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered businesses are included in the profits for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
4 Accounting presentation a Analysis of profit before tax To the extent applicable, presentation of the EEV profit for the year is consistent with the basis that the Group applies for analysis of IFRS basis profits before shareholder taxes between operating and non-operating results.
Operating results reflect the underlying results of the Groups continuing operations including longer-term investment returns.
Operating results include the impact of routine changes of estimates and non-economic assumptions.
Non-operating results include certain recurrent and exceptional items that primarily do not reflect the performance in the year of the Groups continuing operations.
313 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 4 Accounting presentation continued b Investment return Profit before tax With the exception of debt securities held by Jackson, investment gains and losses during the year to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included directly in the profit for the year and shareholders funds as they arise.
The results for any covered business conceptually reflects the aggregate of the IFRS results and the movements on the additional shareholders interest recognised on the EEV basis.
Thus the start point for the calculation of the EEV results for Jackson, as for other businesses, reflects the market value movements recognised on the IFRS basis.
However, in determining the movements on the additional shareholders interest the basis for calculating the Jackson EEV result acknowledges that for debt securities backing liabilities the aggregate EEV results reflect the fact that the value of in-force business instead incorporates the discounted value of future spread earnings.
This value is not affected generally by short-term market movements on securities that are broadly speaking held with the intent and ability to be retained for the longer term.
Separately, from 31 December 2006, fixed income securities backing the free surplus and required capital are accounted for at fair value.
However, consistent with the treatment applied under IFRS for securities classified as available-for-sale, movements in unrealised appreciation on these securities are accounted for in equity rather than in the income statement.
Operating profit Investment returns, including investment gains, in respect of long-term insurance business are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
For the purpose of calculating the longer-term investment return to be included in the operating results of UK operations, where equity holdings are a significant proportion of investment portfolios, values of assets at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market volatility.
For the purposes of determining the long-term returns for debt securities of shareholder-backed operations, a risk margin charge is included which reflects the expected long-term rate of default based on the credit quality of the portfolio.
For Jackson, interest-related realised gains and losses are amortised to the operating results over the maturity period of the sold bonds and for equity-related investments, a long-term rate of return is assumed, which reflects the aggregation of risk-free rates and equity risk premium.
c Pension costs Profit before tax Movements on the shareholders share of surplus or deficit of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes adjusted for contributions paid in the year are recorded within the income statement.
Consistent with the basis of distribution of bonuses and the treatment of the estate described in notes 2d and 2e, the shareholders share incorporates 10 per cent of the proportion of the surplus or deficit attributable to the PAC with-profits fund.
The surplus or deficit is determined by applying the requirements of IAS 19.
Actuarial gains and losses Actuarial gains and losses comprise: the difference between actual and expected return on the scheme assets: experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: and the impact of altered economic and other assumptions on the discounted value of scheme liabilities.
These items are recorded in the income statement but, consistent with the IFRS basis of presentation, are excluded from operating results.
d Effect of changes in economic assumptions and time value of cost of options and guarantees Movements in the value of in-force business caused by changes in economic assumptions and the time value of cost of options and guarantees resulting from changes in economic factors are recorded in non-operating results.
e Results for asset management operations The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profits from management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the expected margin for the year on management of covered business.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of covered business.
314 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 4 Accounting presentation continued f Capital held centrally for Asian operations In adopting the EEV Principles, Prudential has decided to set encumbered capital at its internal targets for economic capital.
In Asia, the economic capital target is substantially higher than the local statutory requirements in total.
Accordingly, capital is held centrally for Asian operations.
For the purpose of the presentation of the Groups operating results, it is assumed that the centrally held capital is lent interest free to the Asian operations.
In turn, the results of the Asian operations include the return on that capital and Group shareholders other income for EEV basis reporting is consequently reduced.
g Taxation The EEV profit for the year for covered business is in most cases calculated initially at the post-tax level.
The post-tax profit is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the effective rate of tax.
In general, the effective rate corresponds to the corporation tax rate on shareholder profits of the business concerned.
h Foreign currency translation Foreign currency profits and losses have been translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities have been translated at year end rates of exchange.
The purpose of translating the profits and losses at average exchange rates, notwithstanding the fact that EEV profit represents the incremental value added on a discounted cash flow basis, is to maintain consistency with the methodology applied for IFRS basis reporting.
The principal exchange rates applied are: Closing rate at Average Closing rate at Average Opening rate Local currency: 31 Dec 2007 for 2007 31 Dec 2006 for 2006 at 1 Jan 2006 Hong Kong 15.52 15.62 15.22 14.32 13.31 Japan 222.38 235.64 233.20 214.34 202.63 Malaysia 6.58 6.88 6.90 6.76 6.49 Singapore 2.87 3.02 3.00 2.93 2.85 Taiwan 64.56 65.75 63.77 59.95 56.38 US 1.99 2.00 1.96 1.84 1.72 The exchange movements in 2007 and 2006 recorded within the movements in shareholders equity and for 2007, in note 16 for long-term business and other operations comprise amounts in respect of: 2007 m 2006 m Long-term business operations: Asian operations 80 169 US operations 53 432 Other operations 37 242 Total 64 359 315 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 5.
The amounts shown are not, and not intended to be, reflective of premium income recorded in the IFRS income statement.
APEs are calculated as the aggregate of regular new business amounts and one-tenth of single new business amounts.
PVNBPs are calculated as equalling single premiums plus the present value of expected premiums of new regular premium business, allowing for lapses and other assumptions made in determining the EEV new business contribution.
New business premiums reflect those premiums attaching to covered business, including premiums for contracts classified as investment products for IFRS basis reporting.
New business premiums for regular premium products are shown on an annualised basis.
Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate business is classified as single recurrent business.
Internal vesting business is classified as new business where the contracts include an open market option.
ii The tables above include the transfer of 62,000 with-profit annuity policies from Equitable Life on 31 December 2007 with assets of approximately 1.7 billion.
The transfer represented an APE of 174 million.
iii The tables for 2006 include a bulk annuity transaction with the Scottish Amicable Insurance Fund SAIF with a premium of 560 million.
The transaction reflects the arrangement entered into in June 2006, for the reinsurance of non-profit immediate pension annuity liabilities of SAIF to Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL a shareholder owned subsidiary of the Group.
SAIF is a closed ring-fenced sub-fund of the PAC long-term fund established by a Court approved Scheme of Arrangement in October 1997, which is solely for the benefit of SAIF policyholders.
Shareholders have no interest in the profits of this fund and, accordingly, it is not part of covered business for EEV reporting purposes.
Consistent with this treatment, and the transfer of longevity risk, requirement for capital support and entitlement to profits on this block of business from SAIF to Prudential shareholders, the transaction has been accounted for as new business for EEV basis reporting purposes.
iv Subsequent to 29 September 2007, following expiry of the previous management agreement, CITIC-Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd CITIC-Prudential, the Groups life operation in China, has been accounted for as a joint venture.
Prior to this date, CITIC-Prudential was consolidated as a subsidiary undertaking.
The amounts in the table above include 100 per cent of the total premiums for this operation up to 29 September 2007 and 50 per cent thereafter, being the Groups share after this date.

For the unwind of discount for UK insurance operations included in operating results based on longer-term returns a further adjustment is made.
For UK insurance operations the amount represents the unwind of discount on the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year assumption changes, the expected return on smoothed surplus assets retained within the PAC with-profits fund and the expected return on shareholders assets held in other UK long-term business operations.
Surplus assets retained within the PAC with-profits fund are smoothed for this purpose to remove the effects of short-term investment volatility from operating results.
In the balance sheet and for total profit reporting, asset values and investment returns are not smoothed.
For US operations the return on surplus assets is shown separately.
ii Asian operations a Changes in operating assumptions The 54 million profit from the effect of changes in operating assumptions for 2007 includes a benefit arising from reductions in corporate tax rates in China, Malaysia and Singapore.
After grossing up the net of tax benefits totalling 25 million for notional tax of 7 million, the effect on the pre-tax operating result based on longer-term investment returns for Asian operations for 2007 is a credit of 32 million.
Also included is a credit of 51 million for the effect of changes in expense assumptions, mainly relating to Singapore 37 million and Korea 21 million both due to increases in investment margins, a further credit of 17 million for the effect of changes in mortality and morbidity assumptions, offset by a charge of 51 million for the effect of changes in persistency assumptions mainly arising in Singapore 29 million as a result of changes in a number of product-related features and updated maturity assumptions and in Taiwan 15 million from an increase in lapse rates, reflecting recent experience.
The 45 million profit from the effect of changes in operating assumptions for 2006 for Asian operations includes 24 million in respect of higher assumed investment management margins based on current experience, a further 24 million for the net effect of altered lapse rates across a number of territories and similarly a net 20 million for changes to mortality and morbidity assumptions offset by a charge of 23 million for other items.
b Experience variances and other items Experience variances and other items, a net charge of 1 million for 2007 2006: credit of 16 million, include a credit of 47 million 2006: 35 million for mortality and morbidity experience variance relating to better than expected experience across most territories and a charge of 27 million 2006: 26 million for expense experience variances in China of 12 million 2006: 14 million and India of 15 million 2006: 12 million.
The negative expense variances in China and India are primarily a reflection of the expenses for new business being in excess of the target levels factored into the valuation of new business for these operations which are at a relatively early stage of development.
On the basis of current plans, the target level for India and existing China operations are planned to be attained in 2011.
Also for 2007 there is a charge of 11 million in respect of Vietnam for higher than expected investment fees payable on asset managers performance, a credit of 4 million 2006: 18 million in respect of the investment return on capital held centrally in respect of Taiwan and 14 million 2006: 11 million of other charges.
319 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 6 Operating profit from business in force continued Notes continued iii US operations The principal component of the 42 million credit in 2006 for other items is 31 million of favourable mortality experience variance.
iv UK insurance operations a Effect of change in UK corporate tax rate At 31 December 2007, a change to reduce the UK corporate tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent in 2008 had been enacted in the legislative process.
Accordingly, the 2007 results incorporate the effects of this change in projecting the tax cash flows attaching to in force business.
Under the convention applied for EEV basis reporting, profits are generally determined on a post-tax basis and then grossed up at the prevailing corporate tax rates to derive pre-tax results.
The effect of the change in the UK corporate tax rate is to give rise to a benefit to the value of business in force at 1 January 2007 of 48 million.
After grossing up this amount for notional tax of 19 million, the effect on the pre-tax operating results based on longer-term investment returns for UK insurance operations for 2007 is a credit of 67 million.
b Annuity business For UK insurance operations there is a net nil charge or credit for both the 2007 and 2006 results.
However, the 2007 results for annuity business have been determined after a strengthening of explicit mortality assumptions and the release of excess margins in the aggregate liabilities that had previously been set aside as an indirect extra allowance for longevity related risks.
The overall impact of the assumption changes and release of margins for 2007 is as follows: m note 1 Strengthening of mortality assumptions 312 Release of margins: note 2 Projected benefit related 144 note 3 Investment related 82 note 4 Expense related 29 note 5 Other 57 312 0 1 The mortality assumptions have been strengthened such that the previous future improvement assumptions of medium cohort for males and 75 per cent of medium cohort for females are now subject to a minimum level of improvement in future years.
2 The release of projected benefit related margins relates to modelling improvements that have been made during 2007 and the effect of hedging inflationary increases on certain deferred annuity business.
3 The release of investment related margins predominantly relates to 38 million in respect of default margins and 43 million for adjustments to the assumed liquidity premium.
The resulting assumptions for expected defaults and liquidity premium, after allowing for the release of margins, remain appropriate given economic conditions at 31 December 2007.
4 A release of expense reserves has been made following recent expense reductions, on which the related cost of capital on the EEV basis is 29 million.
5 This amount reflects the release of other additional margins in the liabilities that are no longer appropriate in light of the explicit strengthening of the mortality assumptions.
c UK insurance operations other items represent: 2007 2006 m m Cost of development of new products and distribution capabilities and costs associated with regulatory requirements for 2006 36 32 notes 1, 3 Annual licence fee payments 13 14 notes 2, 3 Expense overruns in respect of tariff agreement with SAIF 14 16 Adjustments to the policyholder and shareholder taxes for non-participating business of the PAC long-term fund, after grossing up for notional tax 26 note 4 Other items 14 22 77 110 1 The licence fee payments are made by shareholder-backed subsidiaries of UK insurance operations, via a service company, to the PAC withprofits fund for the right to use trademarks and for the goodwill associated with the purchase of the business of the Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society in 1997.
The licence fee arrangements run to 2017.
2 The charge of 14 million 2006: 16 million in respect of SAIF, which is not covered business, is borne by a service company and arises from a tariff arrangement which ran to the end of 2007 and was onerous to shareholders.
3 Charges in respect of items 1 and 2 above are reflected in the EEV and IFRS results on an annual basis.
4 The charge for other items includes a positive persistency experience variance of 1 million 2006: negative variance of 9 million.
320 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 6 Operating profit from business in force continued Notes continued d Expense assumptions The 2006 EEV basis financial statements included note disclosure which explained that in determining the appropriate expense assumptions account had been taken of the cost synergies that were expected to arise with some certainty from the initiative announced in December 2005 from UK insurance operations working more closely with Egg and M&G and the effect of the end to end review of the UK business, which was under way at the time.
On 29 January 2007 the Company announced the sale of Egg to Citi and on 15 March 2007 the Company announced the actions necessary to implement the reassessed plans in light of this transaction and additional initiatives.
In preparing the 2006 results, account was taken of the effect of expense savings that were expected to arise with some certainty.
Without this factor the effect on the 2006 results would have been a charge of 44 million for the net effect of revised assumptions in line with 2006 unit costs.
For the 2007 results the unit costs are in line with assumptions and no anticipation of savings has been incorporated.

321 Notes on the EEV basis supplementary information continued 9 Short-term fluctuations in investment returns continued Notes continued ii Short-term fluctuations for Jackson comprise: 2007 2006 m m Actual investment return on investments less long-term returns included within operating profit: Actual realised losses gains less default assumption and amortisation of interest-related realised gains and losses for fixed maturity securities and related swap transactions 44 20 Actual less long-term return on equity-based investments and other items 51 26 Investment return related loss gain due primarily to changed expectation of profits on in-force variable annuity business in future periods based on current period equity returns, net of related hedging activity 16 17 9 63 This adjustment arises due to market returns being lower higher than the assumed long-term rate of return.
This gives rise to lower higher than expected year end values of variable annuity assets under management with a resulting effect on the projected value of future account values, and hence future profitability.
iii The charge for UK insurance operations for 2007 of 43 million primarily reflects value movements on the bond holdings of PRILs shareholders funds due to the net effect of widened credit spreads and reduced interest rates together with the difference between the actual investment return for the with-profits life fund of 7.2 per cent and the gross long-term assumed rate of 7.85 per cent.
For 2006, the credit of 378 million reflects the PAC life fund investment return of 12.4 per cent.
iv Comparative figures for 2006 have been adjusted from those previously published to exclude discontinued banking operations.
10 Mark to market value movements on core borrowings 2007 m 2006 m US operations 9 3 Other operations 214 82 Total 223 85 Core borrowings of the Group are marked to market value under EEV.
The figures in the table above reflect the movement in the difference between market and IFRS carrying values.
As the liabilities are generally held to maturity or for the long term, no deferred tax asset or liability has been established on the difference compared to IFRS in carrying value.
Accordingly, no deferred tax charge is recorded in the results in respect of the 2007 credit of 223 million 2006: 85 million.
11 Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes The gain of 116 million 2006: gain of 207 million included within profit before tax reflects the shareholders share of actuarial gains and losses on the Groups defined benefit pension schemes.
On the EEV basis, this gain includes a 10 per cent share of the actuarial gains and losses on the share attributable to the PAC with-profits fund for the Prudential Staff and Scottish Amicable Pension Schemes.
The 2007 gains mainly reflect gains due to changes in economic assumptions, partly offset by the effect of strengthened mortality assumptions.
The very high level of shareholders actuarial gains in 2006 reflected the excess of market returns over the long-term assumption and the increase in discount rate applied in determining the present value of projected pension payments from 4.8 per cent at 31 December 2005 to 5.2 per cent at 31 December 2006.
12 Effect of changes in economic assumptions and time value of cost of options and guarantees The profits losses on changes in economic assumptions and time value of cost of options and guarantees resulting from changes in economic factors for in-force business included within the profit from continuing operations before tax including actual investment returns arise as follows: 2007 m 2006 m Change in Change in time value time value Change in of cost of Change in of cost of economic options and economic options and assumptions guarantees Total assumptions guarantees Total note i Asian operations 201 9 210 132 14 118 note ii US operations 81 8 89 51 6 45 note iii UK insurance operations 466 17 449 182 40 222 Total 748 0 748 1 60 59 322 Prudential plc Annual Report 2007 Financial EEV statements 12 Effect of changes in economic assumptions and time value of cost of options and guarantees continued Notes i The principal components of the effect of changes in economic assumptions in 2007 of 201 million for Asian operations are credits of 110 million in Taiwan and 80 million in Hong Kong.
The increase for Taiwan reflects the combined effect of changes to the projected fund earned rate as explained in note 3, and to economic capital versus projected, offset by the effect of an increase in the risk discount rate.
The increase for Hong Kong reflects a reduction in the risk discount rate for all product lines and an increase in the projected fund earned rate for participating and linked business.
The charge of 132 million for 2006 mainly relates to Taiwan where there was a charge of 101 million arising from the delay in the assumed long-term yield projection and the associated effect of this delay on the economic capital requirement.
ii The credit of 81 million for US operations in 2007 arises from the decrease in risk discount rate, partially offset by the negative effect of a reduction in the assumed future rate of return for separate account variable annuity business.
Both changes reflect the 0.7 per cent decrease in the 10-year treasury bond rate as shown in note 3. iii The effect of changes in economic assumptions in 2007 of 466 million for UK insurance operations reflects a 0.35 per cent increase in the fund earned rate arising from the increase in assumed returns on non-UK equities and corporate bond rates which more than offsets the slight reduction in gilt rates as shown in note 3, a partial offset from the cost of credit default swaps of 41 million and the effect of the risk discount rate for business in force reducing slightly by 0.15 per cent in a similar way to the fall in gilt rates as also shown in note 3.

The post-tax profit for covered business is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the effective rates of tax applicable to the countries and periods concerned.
For Asia, this is subject to the availability of taxable profits.
For Jackson, the US federal tax rate of 35 per cent is applied to gross up movements on the value of in-force business.
Effects on statutory tax for the period affect the overall tax rate.
In the UK, the effective rate is the UK corporation tax rate of 28 per cent which will take effect from 1 April 2008 2006: 30 per cent.
ii Including tax relief on Asia development expenses and restructuring costs borne by UK insurance operations.
iii The 2007 tax charge incorporates the notional tax gross up of 26 million attaching to the change of corporate tax rates in China, Malaysia, Singapore ii a iv a and the UK as detailed in notes 6 and 6. iv The tax credit for 2006 on the effect of changes in economic assumptions includes a credit of 9 million in respect of a change in the tax rate for Malaysia.
v The 2006 tax charge for US operations of 251 million includes a charge in respect of prior years of 29 million and a charge of 26 million in respect of a change in valuation of deferred tax under EEV to reflect discounting over a period of four to 11 years depending upon the type of business concerned.
These adjustments also resulted in a reallocation from free surplus to the value of in-force business of 44 million.
vi Comparative results for 2006 have been adjusted from those previously published to exclude discontinued banking operations.

iii With the exception of the share of pension scheme surplus attributable to the PAC with-profits fund which is included in Other operations net assets liabilities, and the borrowings as described in note iv, the amounts shown for the items in the table above that are referenced to this note have been determined on the statutory IFRS basis.
The overall pension scheme surplus, net of tax, attributable to shareholders relating to the Prudential Staff Pension and Scottish Amicable Pension Schemes are determined as shown below: 2007 2006 m m IFRS basis surplus relating to shareholder-backed operations 98 19 Additional EEV surplus relating to shareholders 10 per cent share of the IFRS basis surplus deficit attributable to the PAC with-profits fund 31 6 EEV basis 129 25 iv Net core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed operations comprise: Mark to IFRS Mark to EEV IFRS market value EEV basis market value basis basis adjustment basis 2007 adjustment 2007 2006 2006 2006 m m m m m m Holding company cash and short-term investments 1,456 1,456 1,119 1,119 Core structural borrowings central funds at market value 2,367 38 2,329 2,485 176 2,661 Holding company net borrowings 911 38 873 1,366 176 1,542 Core structural borrowings Jackson at market value 125 22 147 127 31 158 1,036 16 1,020 1,493 207 1,700 Including central finance subsidiaries.
In accordance with the EEV Principles, core borrowings are carried at market value.
v In determining the cost of capital for Jackson, it has been assumed that an amount at least equal to 235 per cent of the risk-based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC at the Company Action Level must be retained.
The impact of the related capital charge is to reduce Jacksons shareholders funds by 84 million 2006: 117 million.
vi The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the UK with-profits business has been based on the present level of 10 per cent.
Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets of the with-profits fund over the lifetime of the business in force.
vii UK long-term business smoothed shareholders funds reflect an adjustment to the assets of the PAC with-profits fund, for the purposes of determining the unwind of discount included in operating profits, to remove the short-term volatility in market values of assets.
Shareholders funds in the balance sheet are determined on an unsmoothed basis.
viii On 1 May 2007, the Company sold Egg.
