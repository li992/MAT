The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for balance sheet purposes: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax assets 124 170 Deferred tax liabilities 1,145 1,050 1,021 880 At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised of 179 million 2006: 187 million.
We do not believe that it is more likely than not that these amounts will be recoverable.
Tax losses of 20 million expire in 2008, 76 million expire between 2009 and 2020 and 1 million expire after 2020.
Other tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 7.8 billion 2006: 5.2 billion.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates are insignificant.
