the principal risks that the group is exposed to are capital risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
the groups policies with respect to managing those risks in both the current and prior year are set out below.
the group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
the groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the group for funding and foreign exchange management.
the groups treasury function operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the groups risks.
the policies provide written principles on net debt management, currency mix of debt, central funding liquidity, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, bonds and guarantees, and cash investment and counterparty limits.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the internal auditors on a regular basis.
Capital risk management the groups policy on capital structure is to keep the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation below a target level which is reviewed by the board.
the target is comfortably below the covenants contained within the groups banking facilities.
Foreign exchange risk the group has operations in many countries worldwide, exposing the group to foreign exchange risk on the translation of the income statement and balance sheet of foreign operations into pounds sterling.
operations are also subject to foreign exchange risk from committed transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and, once recognised, the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
the translation of the balance sheets of overseas operations has been partially hedged by managing the currency mix of the groups borrowings.
the group used euro and swedish krona borrowings to hedge the balance sheet translation of operations with the euro and swedish krona as their functional currency.
the group does not hedge the foreign exchange risk relating to the translation of the income statements of overseas operations.
to mitigate foreign exchange risk arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than an entitys functional currency, assets and liabilities not denominated in the functional currencies are hedged economically by means of forward contracts.
the group treasurys risk management policy requires all companies in the group to hedge their material assets and liability exposures in full by using forward contracts.
additionally, where material, the group hedges its contracted future project cash flows in foreign currencies by using forward contracts.
group treasury is the only entity in the group allowed to transact external foreign exchange contracts with banks.
to ensure compliance with the above policy, subsidiaries will use group treasury as an internal bank, hedging their material foreign exchange exposures on an inter-company basis.
these exposures are then aggregated and netted in group treasury and the overall position hedged externally.
the foreign exchange exposures for the most significant foreign currencies reported to group treasury and the related hedging of those exposures against uK pounds at 31 december were as follows: 2007 Em USDm SEKm Reported exposure 284.8 45.4 828.0 Forward contracts 285.1 45.3 827.8 2006 Em usdm seKm Reported exposure 313.7 123.6 56.8 Forward contracts 313.7 123.6 56.0 125 Logica Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated Financial statements Note 26 Financial instruments continued positive amounts represented an asset or a forward purchase, whereas negative amounts represented a liability or forward sale.
at 31 december 2007, if the euro, swedish krona and us dollar rate on forward contracts used to hedge contracted project future cash flows had weakened strengthened by 10% against the uK pound with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit on these forward contracts would have been lower higher as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of the euro, swedish krona and us dollar forward contracts, as follows: 10% Weakened 10% Strengthened 2007 2006 2007 2006 Project forward contracts m m m m euro 2.1 0.4 2.1 0.4 us dollar 0.3 0.1 0.3 0.1 swedish krona Interest rate risk the groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and debt.
Careful consideration is given to the appropriate split of debt and equity to ensure acceptable levels of liquidity and interest rate risk.
interest rate risk is then further managed by holding a portion of the groups borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
at 31 december 2007, the group had 224.2 million 2006: 208.9 million of fixed rate borrowings out of total borrowings of 591.9 million 2006: 734.4 million.
if interest rates on floating rate euro-, swedish kronaand uK pound-denominated borrowings had been 50 basis points higher during the 12 months ended 31 december 2007 and 2006, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been lower as a result of higher interest expense on those borrowings, as follows: 2007 2006 Borrowings m m euro 1.2 0.6 swedish krona 0.7 0.2 uK pound 0.2 0.2 Liquidity risk the groups policy is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing requirements.
substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
at 31 december 2007, the group had committed bank facilities of 735.9 million 2006: 718.8 million of which 331.4 million 2006: 484.9 million had been drawn down, giving a headroom of 404.5 million 2006: 233.9 million.
the highest amount drawn down on these facilities during 2007 was 636.2 million 2006: 594.5 million.
the table below analyses the groups financial liabilities and net-settled derivative financial instruments into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
the amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and include both interest and principal cash flows.
the adjustment column represents the possible future cash flows attributable to the instrument included in the maturity analysis which are not included in the carrying amount of the financial liability on the balance sheet.
except for bank loans, the convertible bonds, and finance lease obligations, balances due within 12 months equal their carrying balances as the impact of discounting is not significant.

Hedges of net investments in foreign operations Cash flow hedges on 1 January 2007, the group had euro and swedish krona during the 2006 financial year, a net gain of 2.0 million related to borrowings which it has designated as a hedge of the net investment interest rate swaps, that were accounted for as a cash flow hedge, in its subsidiaries in eurozone countries and sweden.
the designated was recycled from equity to the income statement.
the interest rate borrowings comprised the 2.875% 2008 convertible bonds and the swaps were acquired through the WM-data acquisition and had seK2,058 million bank loan and the swedish krona drawn down previously been used by WM-data to hedge floating rate interest under the groups 330 million revolving credit facility.

there was no hedging ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement in the year ended 31 december 2007 2006: nil.
