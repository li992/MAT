12 Share-based compensation The board is authorized to issue options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company and awards of shares in the Company up to a maximum of 10% of the issued ordinary share capital in any five-year period.
The exercise of options or vesting of share awards will be satisfied either out of newly issued share capital, or from shares held by the Company as treasury stock or within the ESOP.
Treasury stock is purchased from the market and the quantum and timing of these purchases is at the discretion of the directors, and based on the share price and short-term cash requirements of the Company.
Under the UK Inland Revenue Executive Approved Share Option Plan the Executive Scheme, the Company may grant options to employees meeting certain eligibility requirements.
Options under the Executive Scheme are exercisable between three and ten years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
Under the Companys Unapproved Scheme the Unapproved Scheme, for which it has not sought approval from the UK tax authorities, options are exercisable one to seven years after their issue, after which time the options expire.
The Company also operates the US ISO Scheme, which is substantially the same as the Unapproved Scheme, the main difference being that the options are exercisable one to five years after their issue.
Under both of these schemes options are exercisable as follows: 25% maximum on first anniversary, 50% maximum on second anniversary, 75% maximum on third anniversary, 100% maximum on fourth anniversary.
Various options to directors under the Unapproved Scheme have certain performance criteria attached, which if met are exercisable after three years, otherwise they will become exercisable after seven years.
There are further schemes for the Companys French and Belgian employees the French Scheme and the Belgian Scheme.
In the French Scheme, options are exercisable between four and seven years after their issue, whilst in the Belgian Scheme, options are exercisable from 1 January following the third anniversary after their issue, up to seven years from issue.
From 2006, the Company has begun issuing Restricted Stock Units RSUs to employees instead of options as approved at the 2006 AGM.
RSUs are actual share awards on vesting rather than options to buy shares at a xed exercise price.
The main RSU awards to employees in all jurisdictions other than France vest similarly to the unapproved scheme above, namely 25% on each anniversary over four years.
RSU awards to the Companys French employees vest 50% after two years, and then a further 25% after three and four years.
Whilst the Company reserves the right to award options to employees going forward, the majority of awards to employees will be in RSUs.
Additionally from 2006, the Company introduced the Deferred Annual Bonus plan DAB.
Under the DAB, which is for directors and selected senior management within the Company, participants are required to defer 50% of any related annual bonus into shares on a compulsory basis.
These shares will be deferred for three years, and then a further matching award will be made depending on the achievement of an EPS performance condition over that time.
The Company also operates the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP, also for directors and selected senior management, whereby share awards are made and vest depending on the Companys TSR performance compared to two comparator groups over the three-year performance period.
Upon the acquisition of Artisan in 2004, the Company assumed the share schemes of Artisan existing at acquisition.
The schemes remained substantially the same as prior to the acquisition, other than the options became options to purchase shares in ARM Holdings plc instead of Artisan Components Inc.
The number and value of options were amended in line with the conversion ratio as detailed in the merger agreement.
The schemes assumed were the 1993 Plan, the 1997 Plan, the 2000 Plan, the 2003 Plan, the Director Plan, the Executive Plan and the ND00 Plan.
ARM Holdings plc 125 Notes to the financial statements US GAAP continued 12 Share-based compensation continued Under each plan, there are multiple vesting templates and vesting periods.
The majority of the options were already vested upon acquisition, and the most common template was 25% vesting after one year, and then 6.25% vesting each quarter thereafter, until 100% vest after four years.
Some options vest on a monthly basis, and some vest over five years.
All options lapse ten years from the date of grant.
In 1998, the Company set up two savings-related share option schemes for all employees and executive directors of the Company.
The number of options granted is related to the value of savings made by the employee.
The period of savings is three or five years except for employees of ARM Inc. where the period is two years.
The option price for grants made in 2007 is set at 80% of the market share price prior to the grant and for grants made in 2006 and before set at 85%, and the right to exercise normally only arises for a six-month period once the savings have been completed except for ARM Inc. where the right to exercise normally only arises for a three-month period once the savings have been completed.
The Company set up further savings-related option schemes in each year up to and including 2006 for all employees and executive directors of the Company, which have the same characteristics as those schemes set up in 1998.
In 2007, a further scheme was created for non-US employees.
In 2007, the Company commenced a new savings-related option scheme for US employees, namely the Employee Share Purchase Plan ESPP.
The period of savings is six months, with the option price being at 85% of the lower of the market share price at the beginning and end of the scheme.
The Company uses the historical price of the Companys stock for the expected volatility assumption, including some adjustments for non-recurring one-time events, consistent with the guidance in FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
Adjustments were made as the Companys assessment of future stock price trends were more representative of historical data excluding these events rather than including them.
The expected life of options is based on known vesting dates and historical exercise patterns for the different schemes.
The risk-free interest rate is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of the share options.
The dividend yield assumption is based on the Companys last declared dividend and expected payouts.
The fair value of the Companys restricted stock units and LTIP awards is based on the share price at date of grant, discounted for any dividends that will not be earned during the vesting period.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of these SAYE options granted during 2007 was 0.52 2006: 0.44: 2005: 0.40.
The weighted-average exercise price of these SAYE options granted during 2007 was 1.104 2006: 1.0264: 2005: 0.9095.
The following table presents details of the total stock-based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item of the Companys consolidated statements of income for the years ended 31 December.
Note that the 2005 comparative income statement has been re-analyzed to absorb the stock-based compensation expenses into the functional line items rather than as a separate line as reported in the income statements in that year.
2005 2006 2007 000 000 000 Cost of revenues 2,489 1,098 959 Research and development costs 1,582 10,609 9,268 Sales and marketing costs 2,132 3,658 3,196 General and administrative costs 3,524 2,927 2,556 Cumulative effect of change in accounting policy 3,496 Share-based payment expense 9,727 21,788 15,979 Tax benefit for share-based payment compensation expense 1,799 4,181 4,246 Share-based payment expense, net of tax 7,928 17,607 11,733 The amounts included in 2006 and 2007 reect the adoption of FAS 123R.
In accordance with the modied prospective transition method, the Companys consolidated statements of income for 2005 have not been restated to reect, and do not include, the impact of FAS 123R.
The cumulative effect of change in accounting policy arises as a re-measurement adjustment for liability-classied awards on cumulative share-based compensation for earlier years on adoption of FAS 123R.
Included within tax benets above is 1,049,000 relating to this cumulative effect of change in accounting policy.
The adoption of FAS 123R will continue to have a significant adverse impact on the Companys reported results of operations, although it should not have a material impact on its overall financial position.
The amount of unearned stock-based compensation currently estimated to be expensed in the period from 2008 to 2012 related to unvested share-based payment awards at 31 December 2007 is 16.3 million 2006: 19.5 million.
Of this amount, 9.7 million is estimated to be expensed in 2008, 4.9 million in 2009, 1.5 million in 2010 and 0.2 million in 2011.
The weighted average period over which the unearned share-based compensation is expected to be recognised is approximately 1.0 years.
If there are any cancellations or accelerated vestings, the Company may be required to accelerate or cancel some of the remaining compensation expense.
The share-based compensation expense in future periods will be more than stated above to the extent that the Company grants additional options or awards after the balance sheet date.
Furthermore, the estimated future compensation charge may be affected by any change to the fair value of liabilityclassied awards.
In accordance with the requirements of the disclosure-only alternative of FAS 123, the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share for 2005 had the Company applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 instead of the guidelines provided by APB 25.
