Financial Instruments and Risk Management ForeignExchange Exposures The Group trades in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translation foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities in the same currencies as the Groups non US Dollar assets.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currency swaps.
The Group designates a portion of the foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges.
As at 31 December 2007 65m and CHF 423m of the Groups borrowings were designated as net investment hedges: the movement in the fair value of these hedges attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in reserves.
The fair value of these borrowings at 31 December 2007 was $469m.
It is the Groups policyfor operating units not to hold material  .
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, the currency cost of purchases by Group companies of finished products and raw materials.
The principal flows of currency are purchases of US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs from Euros, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, as well as cross purchases between US Dollars andSterling.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are used to increase the hedges to upto 100% of the exposure.
The cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and the profits and losses on the hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further twelve month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are Sterling, Euros and US Dollars.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $480m 2006 $425m.
In 2005, the Group entered into a contingent foreign exchange contract to exchange 430m for US Dollars maturing on the date of receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the BSN Medical joint venture.
No amounts would have been receivable or payable under the contract if the sale of BSN Medical had failed to complete.
The contract was shown in the 2005 accounts at fair value based on the expected completion date.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2007, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would increase by $106m 2006 net cash decrease by $24m.
Excluding borrowings held in the same currency as the relevant reporting entity, if the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $72m 2006 $2m.
Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the increase would be $26m 2006 $2m :thisincreasewouldbe fullyoffset by  ingrouploanvalues.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2007 would have been $24m lower 2006 $20m whichwouldbe recognised through the hedging reserve.
Similarly, if Sterling were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2007 would have been $21m lower 2006 $19m.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar against all other currencies at 31 December would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amountsshownabove, onthe basis that all othervariables remainconstant.
Since the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges, the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates is not significant.
Interest Rate Exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at floating rates.
The Group uses floating to fixed interest swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in equity, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash flows resulting from interest 106 22.
Financial Instruments and Risk Management continued rate swaps match cash flows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash flow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
The Group had fixed future interest rates on borrowingstotalling$710m at 31 December2007 2006 nil fora periodofoneyear.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2007, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $6m 2006 decrease by $2m.
Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $13m 2006 decrease of $2m.
Similarly if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies, the fair value of the Groups interest rate swaps would increase equity by $7m 2006 nil.
A decrease of interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have had an equal but opposite effect tothe amounts shownabove.
Credit Risk Exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates withina policyof  to reduceexposure to .
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2007 was $1m 2006 $6m being the gross debit fair value on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2007 was $170m 2006 $346m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a numberof different countries.

Currency and Interest Rate Profile of Interest Bearing Liabilitiesand Assets In 2007, the Group entered into a series of interest rate swaps to fix monthly interest payable on $710m 2006 nil of the Groups floating rate borrowings for a period of one year.
The swaps are denominated in US Dollars, Euros and Swiss Francs.
