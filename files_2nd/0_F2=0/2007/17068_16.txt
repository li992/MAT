RETiREmEnT BEnEfiT OBLiGATiOn WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 6 a i.
The scheme is independent of the Company and is administered by a Trustee.
The Trustee of the Pension Trust has extensive powers over the pension plans arrangements, including the ability to determine the levels of contribution.
The scheme has been closed to new members since 1996 and was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007.
On the date of demerger, 31 August 2006, the assets and liabilities of the Pension Trust and the WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan were split between the Smiths News business and the Retail business by way of a sectionalisation.
Each section only contains the accounts of members who are or were employed by the relevant business.
There are no cross-subsidies or cross-guarantees between the sections of the Pension Trust.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit scheme were allocated to the Smiths News business section and the WHSmith Retail business section in proportions that reflected the related liabilities of active, deferred, pensioner and orphan members belonging to the respective Smiths News and Retail businesses.

RETiREmEnT BEnEfiT OBLiGATiOn COnTinuEd The amounts recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities in relation to these plans are as follows: m 2007 2006 Present value of the obligations 657 674 Fair value of plan assets 657 608 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 66 Deferred taxation Note 25 20 Net retirement obligation 46 a defined benefit pension scheme i The WHSmith Pension Trust On 2 April 2007, the WHSmith Pension Trust was closed to defined benefit service accrual.
The actuarial impact of this change on the liabilities of the WHSmith Pension Trust has been reflected in the non cash curtailment gain of 10m.
During the year, the Group made a one-off post demerger cash contribution of 25m and a further contribution of 10m in relation to the agreed pension deficit funding to the WHSmith Pension Trust.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries, Mercer Limited, using the projected unit basis.
On an ongoing funding basis the gross actuarial defined benefit pension deficit at 31 August 2007 for WH Smith PLC was approximately 46m approximately 33m net of related deferred taxes 2006: approximately 116m and 84m net of related deferred taxes for the Pension Trust.
The ongoing deficit is greater than the IAS 19 deficit primarily due to the different assumptions and calculation methodologies.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a new investment policy in order to substantially reduce the volatility in the underlying investment performance and reduce the risk of a significant increase in the deficit in the fund.
The assets in the investment fund were restructured in order to adopt this policy.
This involved the assets being invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy.
The key features of this new investment policy were that: 94 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets were invested in an LDI policy with a leading international institutional fund manager: and 6 per cent of the Pension Trusts assets were used to purchase a portfolio of long-dated equity call options.
These represented a notional exposure to underlying equities of some 210m.
The impact of this change in investment policy is to substantially reduce the volatility in the fund and the resultant risk of a significant increase in the overall deficit whilst enabling the fund to continue to benefit from any potential higher returns in the equity markets.
The valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.
The principal long-term assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were: % 2007 2006 Rate of increase in salaries 4.24 4.00 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred pensions 3.24 3.00 Discount rate 5.53 5.10 Inflation assumptions 3.24 3.00 WH Smith PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 56 The amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows: m 2007 2006 Current service cost 4 6 Curtailment gain 10 Interest cost 34 32 Expected return on scheme assets 32 29 4 9 The charge for the current service cost and the exceptional curtailment gain have been included in administrative costs.

Total premiums paid by the Group during the period in respect of these benefits were 0.1m 2006: 0.1m.
The present value of the future liabilities under this arrangement at each reporting date has been assessed by independent actuaries Mellon Human Resources & Investor Solutions Actuaries & Consultants Limited and this amount was included on the balance sheet within retirement benefit obligations.
In September 2005, the members were offered the option to be bought out of this scheme, which was accepted by the majority of the members.
The impact of the settlement was a 5m reduction in the net deficit.
A small number of members opted to remain in the scheme and the present value of the remaining future liabilities is valued at 0.1m net of deferred taxation.
b defined contribution pension scheme The pension cost charged to income for the Groups defined contribution scheme, WH Smith Retirement Savings Plan, amounted to 2m for the year ended 31 August 2007 2006: 2m.

A long-term receivable of 5m has been reclassified to other intangible assets as at 1 September 2005. Credit Risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group Treasury policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These approved counterparties have a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 A-1 and long-term ratings of A1 A or better.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
