The BHP Billiton Group anticipates benefits from the recognition of losses in future periods to the extent of income or gains in relevant jurisdictions.
The gross amount of tax losses carried forward that have not been tax effected expire as summarised below: Australia UK Foreign Total Year of expiry US$M US$M US$M US$M Income tax losses Not later than one year 34 34 Later than one year and not later than two years 10 10 Later than two years and not later than three years 46 46 Later than three years and not later than four years 1 1 Later than four years and not later than five years 10 10 Later than five years and not later than ten years 67 67 Later than ten years and not later than twenty years 109 109 Unlimited 344 191 535 344 468 812 Capital tax losses Later than one year and not later than two years 1 1 Later than two years and not later than three years 1 1 Unlimited 745 3 16 764 Gross amount of tax losses not recognised 745 347 486 1,578 Tax effect of total losses not recognised 224 97 155 476 BHP BILLITON ANNUAL REPORT 2007 199 5260 BHPB AReport Pt3 10 9 07 4:55 PM Page 200 Notes to Financial Statements continued 8 Income tax and deferred tax continued Tax credits At 30 June 2007, the BHP Billiton Group had US$120 million of tax credits that have not been recognised 2006: US$nil.
Tax losses and tax credits recognised The gross amount of tax losses and tax credits that have been included in deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarised as follows: Australia UK Foreign Total Year of expiry US$M US$M US$M US$M Income tax losses and credits Not later than one year 11 Later than one year and not later than two years 8 8 Later than two years and not later than three years 37 37 Later than three years and not later than four years 16 16 Later than four years and not later than five years Later than five years and not later than ten years 3 3 Later than ten years and not later than twenty years 2,621 2,621 Unlimited 732 326 1,058 732 3,012 3,744 Capital tax losses Unlimited 27 27 Gross amount of tax losses and tax credits recognised 27 732 3,012 3,771 Deductible temporary differences At 30 June 2007, the BHP Billiton Group had deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets of US$1,492 million 2006: US$1,791 million have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
The BHP Billiton Group anticipates it will continue to incur foreign expenditure including exploration, or incur losses, in jurisdictions in which, under current accounting policies, the tax-effect of such expenditure or losses may not be recognised.
The BHP Billiton Group will continue to incur non deductible accounting depreciation and amortisation.
The BHP Billiton Group recognises net deferred tax assets relating to tax losses and temporary differences to the extent that it can reasonably foresee future profits against which to realise those assets.
Following continued progress in the BHP Billiton Groups Gulf of Mexico US projects, additional benefits of tax losses and temporary differences have been recognised in the current year resulting in a reduction in the effective tax rate of approximately 2 per cent 2006: 3 per cent: 2005: 4 per cent when compared to the statutory tax rate.
Temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities At 30 June 2007, deferred tax liabilities of US$1,081 million 2006: US$1,446 million associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities have not been recognised because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Other factors affecting taxation The Australian Taxation Office ATO issued assessments in 2005 against subsidiary companies, primarily BHP Billiton Finance Ltd, in respect of the 1999 to 2002 financial years.
The assessments relate to the deductibility of bad debts in respect of funding subsidiaries that undertook the Beenup, Boodarie Iron and Hartley projects.
Appeals have been lodged in the Federal Court against the assessments.
As at 30 June 2007, the total amount in dispute relating to bad debts on loans is approximately US$1,006 million, comprising primary tax of US$586 million and US$420 million of interest and penalties after tax.
An amount of US$541 million in respect of the disputed amounts has been paid pursuant to ATO disputed assessments guidelines.
The amounts paid have been recognised as a reduction of the Groups net deferred tax liabilities.
Upon any successful challenge of the assessments, any sums paid will be refundable with interest.
