This information does not represent the results the Group would have achieved had each of the acquisitions and divestments during the period 1 January 31 December occurred on 1 January.
ISS includes these financial measures because it believes that they are useful measures of the Groups results of operations and liquidity: however, these items are not measures of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute for operating profit, net profit, cash flow or other financial measures computed in accordance with IFRS.
Other companies, including those in the Groups industry, may calculate similarly titled financial measures differently from the Group.
Because all companies do not calculate these financial measures in the same manner, ISSs presentation of such financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for managements discretionary use due to covenant restrictions, debt service payments and other commitments.
In addition, the calculations of some of these financial measures take into account estimates of pre-acquisition and post-acquisition results, which by their nature are uncertain.

By using operating profit before other items as a starting point for the calculation of adjusted EBITDA instead of operating profit, the Group excludes from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA integration costs relating to acquisitions and items recorded under the line item Other income and expenses, net.
This line item includes income and expenses that ISS believes are not a part of its normal ordinary operations, such as gains and losses arising from divestments, the winding-up of operations, disposals of property, restructurings and certain acquisition related costs.
Some of the items that ISS records under the line item Other income and expenses, net are recurring and some are non-recurring in nature.

These amounts are estimates in part because i the historical income statement information that was available for the acquired businesses for the periods from 1 January to the date of their acquisition by the Group has been converted and adjusted by the Group as described below, and ii income statement information was generally not available for any of the acquired businesses for the portions of the twelve-month period ended 31 December from the dates of the last annual or interim financial statements of the acquired businesses until the date on which they were purchased by the Group.
These estimates are based on estimates of the EBITA of the acquired businesses for pre-acquisition portions of the financial year in which the acquisition occurred and for the preceding financial year and originally included in standardised reports of potential acquisitions prepared in the normal course of business by ISS local management.
The definition of EBITA is the same as that of Adjusted EBITDA, but after depreciation.
The estimated Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve-month period ended 31 December was prepared using the following methodology: i first, by estimating the annual EBITA of the acquired businesses: EBITA estimates of the acquired businesses for historical periods were based on the historical annual or interim financial statements of the acquired businesses: in some cases, EBITA estimates for historical periods were based on financial statements of the acquired businesses, prepared under relevant local generally accepted accounting principles: where the financial statements of the acquired businesses were not audited by the local auditors of such businesses, EBITA for historical periods was estimated with reference to unaudited internal management accounts of those entities: EBITA estimates of the acquired businesses were then converted to ISS accounting policies by local ISS management for inclusion in the acquisition reports: EBITA estimates included in the acquisition reports did not take account of seasonality or expected synergies, but were adjusted on a case-by-case basis to take into account additional information regarding known material positive or negative changes in the acquired businesses, such as contract gains and losses, available at the time of acquisition from interim reports, management accounts of the acquired businesses and other sources: the estimated annual EBITA for each of the acquired businesses was allocated in an equal pro rata amount to each month of the portion of the twelve-month period ended 31 December prior to its acquisition by ISS: ii Second, by estimating the annual EBITDA of the acquired businesses: the total estimated EBITA for all of the acquired businesses was then adjusted to add back an amount of estimated depreciation for each of the acquired businesses for the portion of the twelve-month period ended 31 December prior to its acquisition by ISS, by applying a rate of depreciation of 1.5% to the revenues of each such entity acquired during the twelve-month period ended 31 December and allocating the result in equal pro rata amounts to each month of the period: iii Third, by estimating the EBITDA of the divested businesses: the estimated EBITA of the divested businesses was derived from the unaudited management accounts of those divested businesses: and the total estimated EBITA for all of the divested businesses was then adjusted to add back an amount of depreciation for each of the divested businesses, by applying the reported depreciation of the divested entity if the entity was separately reported in the unaudited management accounts or, if the depreciation of the entity was not separately reported in the unaudited management accounts, by applying a rate of depreciation of 1.5% to the revenues of each such entity divested during the twelve-month period ended 31 December.

Amounts in DKK millions Capitalisation Table continued Notes: 1 Accounting Adjustments: i Market price adjustments of Euro Medium Term Notes: The Euro Medium Term Notes issued by ISS Global A S were recognised in the opening balance sheet at their market price as of 9 May 2005, the date of ISS Holding A Ss acquisition of ISS A S, as part of ISS Holding A Ss purchase price allocation prepared in connection with the Acquisition.
The difference between this market price and the principal amount is amortised in the consolidated financial statements over the remaining term of the Euro Medium Term Notes.
The unamortised market price adjustment as at 31 December 2007, amounting to DKK 292 million related to the Euro Medium Term Notes due 2010 and DKK 137 million related to the Euro Medium Term Notes due 2014, is reversed in the above table to reflect the principal amount of the Euro Medium Term Notes.
ii Gains on interest rate swaps: In June 2005 and June 2006, ISS settled the interest rate swaps hedging the Euro Medium Term Notes issued by ISS Global A S and realised a net gain, which is being recognised in the income statement over the remaining term of the Euro Medium Term Notes.
At 31 December 2007, the unamortised portion of the gain amounted to DKK 55 million, which is reversed in the above table to reflect the principal amount of the hedged Euro Medium Term Notes.
iii unamortised financing fees: According to IFRS, a liability in respect of a loan is recorded at an amount equal to the net proceeds received from such loan and not its principal amount.
The difference between the principal amount required to be repaid at maturity and the net proceeds received represents unamortised financing fees and is amortised through the income statement over the term of the relevant liability.
To reflect the principal amount of loan liabilities at 31 December 2007, unamortised financing fees of DKK 82 million related to Term Facility A, DKK 121 million related to Term Facility B, DKK 64 million related to the Second Lien Facility, and DKK 103 million related to the 8.875% Subordinated Notes are reversed.
Compared to previous quarters, a portion of unamortised financing fees have been re-allocated between the Senior Facilities.
The re-allocation of these non-cash items did not impact the total carrying value or the total Consolidated as Adjusted value of the Senior Facilties.
iv Debt related to joint taxation: ISS is jointly taxed with ISS Equity A S and its Danish resident subsidiaries.
The Danish income tax payable is allocated between the jointly taxed Danish companies based on their proportion of taxable income.
At 31 December 2007, the consolidated financial statements of ISS included a liability of DKK 20 million to ISS Equity A S, the ultimate Danish parent of the Group.
In the absence of the joint taxation scheme, this liability would not have been recorded under short-term debt but under tax payables.
To adjust for the accounting effect of the joint taxation scheme, DKK 20 million is excluded from short-term debt.

In addition, DKK 998 million of the Revolving Credit Facility was allocated to support performance bonds issued by operating subsidiaries.
c Acquisition Facility A in an amount equivalent to DKK 1,425 million, of which DKK 1,384 were drawn as at 31 December 2007 and Acquisition Facility B in an amount equivalent to DKK 3,500 million of which DKK 406 million was drawn as at 31 December 2007. d a letter of credit facility in an amount equivalent to DKK 500 million.
Letters of credit are primarily issued in support of borrowings, other than borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility or the Secured Local Facilities, and, to the extent these borrowings are deemed to constitute indebtedness, the borrowings are included in other short-term debt and other long-term debt in ISSs consolidated financial statements.
The Senior Facilities have been drawn in certain currencies in addition to Danish Kroner as specified under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
4 Other short-term debt includes borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility which are primarily provided by local lenders to certain subsidiaries primarily to fund working capital requirements, other local credit facilities and finance leases.
