Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
General information Drax Group plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985.
The Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate in the electricity generation industry within the UK.
The address of the Companys registered office and principal establishment is Drax Power Station, PO Box 3, Selby, North Yorkshire YO8 8PQ, United Kingdom.
The operating companies of the Group are disclosed in note 3 of the Companys separate financial statements, which follow these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the consolidated financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities under IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement.
Adoption of new and revised accounting standards In the current year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosures which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements.
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the Groups financial instruments and management of capital.
Four interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current period.
These are: IFRIC 7 Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies: IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2: IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives: and IFRIC 10 Interim financial reporting and impairment.
The adoption of these interpretations has not led to any changes in the Groups accounting policies.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards and interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 8 Operating segments IAS 23 Revised borrowing costs IFRIC 11 IFRS 2: Group and treasury share transactions IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements IFRIC 13 Customer loyalty programmes effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008 IFRIC 14 IAS 19: The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction The directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
Summary of significant accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to both years presented, unless otherwise stated.
A Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to the reporting date each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
B Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements reasonable knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The critical accounting judgements and associated estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Fixed assets and depreciation Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
The carrying values of fixed assets are also reviewed for impairment where there has been a trigger event that is, an event which may have resulted in an impairment by assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows and net realisable value compared with net book value.
The calculation of estimated future cash flows and residual values is based on the directors reasonable estimates of future prices, output and costs, and is, therefore, subjective.
60 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Pensions The Group operates an approved defined benefit scheme.
The Group accounts for this scheme in accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits with the cost of providing benefits determined using the projected unit credit method, and actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected returns on scheme assets, salary and pension increases, and mortality rates.
These actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate.
The Group believes that the assumptions utilised in recording obligations under the scheme are reasonable based on prior experience, market conditions and the advice of scheme actuaries.
However, actual results may differ from such assumptions.
Taxation In accounting for taxation the Group makes assumptions regarding the treatment of items of income and expenditure for tax purposes.
The Group believes that these assumptions are reasonable based on prior experience and consultation with advisers.
Full provision is made for deferred taxation, as required under IAS 12 Income taxes, at the rates of tax prevailing at the period end dates unless future rates have been substantively enacted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is considered more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Derivatives The Group applies IFRS 7, IAS 32 Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation and IAS 39.
IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be recorded in the balance sheet at their fair value.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met.
The fair values of derivative instruments for commodities are determined using forward price curves.
Forward price curves represent the Groups estimates of the prices at which a buyer or seller could contract today for delivery or settlement of a commodity at future dates.
The Group generally bases forward price curves upon readily obtainable market price quotations, as the Groups commodity contracts do not generally extend beyond the actively traded portion of these curves.
However, the forward price curves used are only an estimate of how future prices will move and are, therefore, subjective.
C Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods or services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes and excluding transactions with or between wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Revenues from the sale of electricity are recorded based upon output delivered at rates specified under contract terms or prevailing market rates as applicable.
Revenues from sales of Renewables Obligation Certificates ROCs are recorded at the invoiced value, net of VAT.
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not treated as giving rise to revenue.
Where goods or services are exchanged for goods or services of a dissimilar nature, the exchange is treated as giving rise to revenue.
The revenue is measured at the fair value of goods or services received, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
If the fair value of the goods or services received cannot be measured reliably, the revenue is measured at the fair value of the goods or services given up, adjusted by the amount of any cash or cash equivalents received or paid.
D Segmental reporting Turnover comprises primarily sales of electricity generated by the Group to the electricity wholesale market in Great Britain.
As such, the Group has only one business segment and one geographical segment.
E Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost.
Cost comprises the purchase price after deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, and the initial estimate of costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site.
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment in value.
Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write-down assets to their residual value evenly over the estimated useful lives of the assets from the date of acquisition limited to the expected decommissioning date of the power station.
The estimated useful lives are: Years Main generating plant and freehold buildings 35 Other plant and machinery 420 Decommissioning asset 35 Plant spare parts 35 Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually, taking into account commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear, and any provision for impairment calculated in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
Residual values are based on prices prevailing at each balance sheet date.
61 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued E Property, plant and equipment continued Costs relating to major inspections, overhauls and upgrades to the power station are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, if the recognition criteria of IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment are met: namely, when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
F Impairment of tangible assets At each balance sheet date the Group reviews its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that these assets may have suffered an impairment loss.
If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the asset value-in-use or fair value less selling costs, if higher.
If an asset is impaired, a provision is made to reduce its carrying amount to the estimated recoverable amount.
The discount rate applied is a pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.
G Decommissioning costs Provision is made for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, if and when a legal or constructive obligation arises, on a discounted basis.
The amount provided represents the present value of the expected costs.
An amount equivalent to the discounted provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable and similar charges.
H Inventories Inventories primarily comprise coal stocks, together with other fuels and consumables.
Coal stocks are valued at the lower of the weighted average of coal delivered to the stock pile and net realisable value.
Other stocks of fuel and consumables are valued at the lower of average cost and net realisable value.
The Group is able to claim ROCs from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets OFGEM as a result of burning renewable fuels.
A market exists for sale of ROCs and the Group recognises income in the income statement at the point where the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
The attributable incremental cost of generating ROCs above that of burning coal is included within inventory in respect of ROCs earned but not yet sold.
The inventory value is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
I CO2 emissions allowances The Group recognises its free emissions allowances received under the National Allocation Plan at nil cost.
Any additional allowances purchased in the market are recorded at cost.
The Group also recognises a liability in respect of its obligations to deliver emissions allowances.
The charge to the income statement and the related liability is measured based on the current estimates of the amounts that will be required to satisfy the net obligation, taking into account generation, free allowances allocated under the National Allocation Plan, market purchases and forward contracts already in place.
J Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered probable that taxable profit will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised, and is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited to equity via the statement of recognised income and expense, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity and is shown in the statement of recognised income and expense.
K Pension and other post-retirement benefits The Group provides pensions through an approved industry defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit scheme is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The Group has taken advantage of the option within IAS 19 to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the period in which they occur outside the income statement in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The current service cost and finance cost of the pension charge are deducted in arriving at operating profit.
The retirement benefits obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the net deficit in the Groups defined benefit pension scheme, gross of deferred tax.
For the defined contribution scheme, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due to be paid.
62 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 L Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period, based on an estimate of the shares that will ultimately vest.
M Foreign currencies The Groups consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company and its principal subsidiaries.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the date of transaction.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the income statement.
N Financial instruments IAS 39 requires that relevant financial assets and liabilities be measured at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reported through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are considered effective hedges.
IAS 32 and IFRS 7 prescribe certain disclosures on the use and impact of financial instruments designed to help the users of accounts understand the significance of the financial instruments to an entitys financial position, performance and cash flows, as well as the factors that affect amounts, timing and risks associated with future cash flows.
Financial liability and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Debt instruments The Group measures all debt instruments, whether financial assets or financial liabilities, initially at fair value of the consideration paid or received.
Transaction costs any such costs incremental and directly attributable to the issue of the financial instrument are included in the calculation of the effective interest rate and are, in effect, amortised through the income statement over the life of the instrument.
Subsequent to initial measurement, debt instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Commodity contracts and treasury derivatives Where possible, the Group takes the own use exemption permitted by IAS 39 for commodity contracts entered into and held for the purpose of the Groups own purchase, sale or usage requirements.
Commodity contracts which do not qualify for the own use exemption are dealt with as derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that contracts are considered to be effective hedges.
The Group uses a number of treasury-related derivatives to manage exposure to interest rate and currency fluctuations.
Treasury-related derivatives are recorded at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value reflected through the income statement, or the hedge reserve to the extent that derivatives are considered to be effective hedges.
Income statement movements under interest rate hedges are accounted for as adjustments to finance cost income for the period.
The Group designates certain hedging instruments used to address commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item is documented, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instruments used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are released in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss.
The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedge relationship is less than 12 months.
Derivatives not designated into an effective hedge relationship are classified as a current asset or current liability.
Share capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
The share premium account records the difference between the nominal value of shares issued and the fair value of the consideration received.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.

Exceptional operating income Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Distributions under the TXU Claim 6.2 19.0 The Group received 6.2 million under the TXU Claim in April 2007, bringing the total received to date to 336 million, representing full recovery of the claim.
All amounts above are net of VAT and costs, and all proceeds have been used to prepay debt secured against the claim, which has now been repaid in full.
Operating profit Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m The following charges have been included in arriving at operating profit: Staff costs note 28 42.9 34.6 Depreciation of property, plant and equipment all owned assets 43.7 34.9 Repairs and maintenance expenditure on property, plant and equipment 50.4 34.1 Other operating expenses 102.4 94.0 Total other operating expenses excluding exceptional items and unrealised gains on derivative contracts 239.4 197.6 Auditors remuneration During the year the Group obtained the following services from its auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, at costs as detailed below: Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 000 000 Audit fees: Fees payable for the audit of the Groups consolidated financial statements 272 225 Fees payable for the audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 10 9 282 234 Other services: Pursuant to legislation interim review 55 46 Total audit related fees 337 280 Taxation services 195 Information technology selection process advice 50 Other services 66 49 Total non-audit fees 261 99 Total auditors remuneration 598 379 In addition to the amount set out above, the Drax Power Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme paid fees of 150,000 2006: 140,000 to Deloitte & Touche LLP in respect of pension advisory services.
Fees payable to Deloitte & Touche LLP and their associates for non-audit services to the Company are not required to be disclosed because the consolidated financial statements are required to disclose such fees on a consolidated basis.

Finance costs Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Interest payable and similar charges: Interest payable on bank borrowings 30.7 32.7 Amortisation of deferred financing costs 3.6 4.4 Total interest payable and similar charges 34.3 37.1 Interest receivable: Interest income on bank deposits 11.4 13.4 Total interest receivable 11.4 13.4 7.
Taxation The income tax expense reflects the estimated effective tax rate on profit before taxation for the Group for the year ending 31 December 2007 and the movement in the deferred tax balance in the period, so far as it relates to items recognised in the income statement.
In June 2007, the Finance Bill was presented to Parliament for approval.
The Bill proposed a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax from 30% to 28% with effect from 1 April 2008.
At 31 December 2007 the rate reduction was substantively enacted, and accordingly the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2007 includes a credit of 17.9 million to reflect the impact on deferred tax.
This rate reduction will also reduce the amount of tax payable on future profits.
Although amendments to the industrial buildings allowance regime were also proposed in the 2007 budget announcement, these amendments were not substantively enacted at 31 December 2007 and accordingly have not been reflected in the Groups results for the year ended 31 December 2007.
The directors have estimated that, had these amendments been reflected in the Groups results for the year ended 31 December 2007, the effect would be to increase the deferred tax liability held in the balance sheet by approximately 13 million.
HM Revenue & Customs HMRC issued a consultation document in December 2007 entitled Principles based approach to financial products avoidance: a consultation document which is expected to lead to the introduction of new legislation concerning disguised interest from 1 April 2008.
It is thought likely that the new rules, if introduced in the form currently envisaged, could adversely impact the future tax efficiency of the Groups existing financing stucture.
Until the consultation process is completed and the legislation drafted, however, it is not possible to predict with any certainty how the proposed legislation, if and when enacted, might affect the Group tax rate, and the Group is therefore keeping the situation under review.
Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Tax charge comprises: Current tax 112.2 108.2 Deferred tax: Before impact of reduction in tax rate 1.2 62.5 Impact of reduction in tax rate 17.9 95.5 170.7 Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Tax on items charged credited to equity: Deferred tax on actuarial losses gains on defined benefit pension scheme 0.9 2.6 Impact of reduction in tax rate on deferred tax on defined benefit pension scheme 0.4 Deferred tax on fair value losses gains on cash flow hedges 171.1 140.5 Impact of reduction in tax rate on deferred tax on fair value losses gains on cash flow hedges 1.0 172.6 143.1 65 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 7.
Taxation continued The tax differs from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% for both years.
The differences are explained below: Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Profit before tax 448.5 634.2 Profit before tax multiplied by rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% for both years 134.6 190.3 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior periods 0.4 1.2 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.5 0.5 Tax effect of funding arrangements 22.9 20.9 Other 0.6 0.4 Change in UK tax rate 17.9 Total taxation 95.5 170.7 In addition to the foregoing, under the current financing structure, Drax Holdings Limited is partially funded by a Eurobond payable to another group company, with a tax deduction being claimed for all of the corresponding interest charged in the Drax Holdings Limited income statement.
Were HMRC to successfully challenge the deductions claimed in respect of the Eurobond coupons for open years to 31 December 2007, it is estimated that the additional tax liability would be up to 85 million, together with interest and penalties.
Further details of the Groups financing structure, and related contingent tax liability described above, are included on pages 78 and 79 of the listing particulars issued on 28 October 2005 in respect of the introduction of Drax Group plc to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority.
Dividends Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year based on the number of shares in issue at the record date : Interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 4.7 pence per share paid on 24 October 2007 2006: 4.0 pence per share paid on 25 October 2006 16.3 16.3 Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 9.1 pence per share paid on 16 May 2007 33.6 Special interim dividends for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 32.9 pence per share paid on 16 May 2007 2006: 80.0 pence per share paid on 25 October 2006 121.4 325.7 171.3 342.0 Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Amounts not recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 9.9 pence per share 2006: 9.1 pence per share paid on 16 May 2007 33.6 33.6 Declared special interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 7.8 pence per share 2006: 32.9 pence per share paid on 16 May 2007 26.5 121.4 60.1 155.0 The Company undertook share consolidations in connection with the special interim dividends paid on 16 May 2007 and 25 October 2006 note 20.
66 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting the Board is recommending to shareholders that a resolution is passed to approve payment of a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2007 of 9.9 pence per share equivalent to approximately 33.6 million payable on or before 7 May 2008.
The Board has declared a further interim dividend payable as a special dividend of 7.8 pence per share equivalent to approximately 26.5 million, also payable on or before 7 May 2008.
The final dividend of 9.9 pence per share and the special dividend of 7.8 pence per share have not been included as liabilities as at 31 December 2007.
Earnings per share During the year the Group has amended the calculation of earnings per share.
Previously, the calculation of the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding assumed that share consolidations took place at the beginning of the relevant period.
However, to better reflect the linkage between the special dividends and the related share consolidations, the number of shares in issue is now only amended from the date of the share consolidation.
This change affects disclosure only and has no effect on profits, assets, liabilities or cash flows.
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year is adjusted to take account of outstanding share options in relation to the Groups Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE and contingently issuable shares under the Groups Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculation are set out below.
Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings 353.0 463.5 Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share millions 354.9 400.0 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares under share options 0.1 0.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share millions 355.0 400.1 The effect of the amendments to the Groups calculation of earnings per share can be summarised as follows: Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 Number of shares: Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share as previously reported millions 349.6 368.9 Effect of share consolidations from beginning of relevant period millions 5.3 31.1 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share under revised basis millions 354.9 400.0 Earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the purposes of basic and diluted earnings millions 353.0 463.5 Basic earnings per share as previously reported pence per share 101 126 Basic earnings per share under revised basis pence per share 99 116 The effect of this amendment in respect of diluted earnings per share is the same as set out above.
67 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 10.
During the year ended 31 December 2007 depreciation was accelerated for plant and machinery which the Group expects to replace under its capital expenditure investment programme, resulting in an increase in depreciation for the year of approximately 7.0 million.

68 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Management do not consider there to be a significant concentration of credit risk and as a result, do not believe that a further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful debts of 0.1 million 2006: 0.1 million.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
Cash and cash equivalents As at 31 December 2007 2006 m m Cash and cash equivalents 59.7 154.8 14.

Payment profiles for repayment of debt set out above are based on the fixed minimum repayment profile.
Repayments above the fixed minimum repayment profile are permitted subject to the amount of cash available for debt service.
Term loans repayments of 40.0 million were made on each of 29 June 2007 and 31 December 2007.
Previously, repayments of 57.5 million were made on each of 30 June 2006 and 29 December 2006.
All repayments have been made in line with the target repayment profile as a result of the levels of cash available for debt service.
The bridge loan was repaid in full following receipt of the final distribution under the TXU Claim in April 2007.
On 11 May 2006, the Group entered into a new credit facility agreement providing a further 100.0 million term loan on similar terms and with a similar repayment profile to the existing term borrowings.
The facility was drawn down in full on 3 July 2006 and partially used to make a payment of 22.5 million into the employee pension scheme to reduce the actuarial deficit note 29.
The Groups debt is guaranteed and secured directly by each of the principal subsidiary undertakings of the Company, as set out in note 3 to the Companys separate financial statements.
Drax Group plc is not a guarantor of the Groups debt, but has granted a charge over the shares in its subsidiary, Drax Finance Limited.
Letter of credit facility and revolving credit facility In addition to its borrowings, the Group has access to a letter of credit facility which provides credit support of up to 200.0 million to the Groups trading activities.
The letter of credit facility, which has a final maturity date of 15 December 2012, provides a mechanism whereby it may be extended for a further 12 months at any time after 15 December 2007, but no later than one year before the final maturity date.
The Group guarantees the obligations of a number of banks in respect of the letters of credit issued by those banks to counterparties of the Group.
As at 31 December 2007 the Groups contingent liability in respect of these guarantees amounted to 133.3 million 2006: 153.6 million.
In addition, the Group has access to an undrawn 100.0 million revolving credit facility, which may be used to issue letters of credit or for working capital, with a final maturity date of 15 December 2010.

Other non-current liabilities As at 31 December 2007 2006 m m Retentions 1.4 0.7 The retention liabilities relate to amounts held back from certain suppliers pending satisfaction of contractually agreed performance criteria.
The Group estimates that substantially all retention liabilities will fall due for payment in more than one year but in not more than two years.
Financial instruments The Group issues or holds financial instruments for two purposes: financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Groups operations: and financial instruments relating to the financing and risks of the Groups debt portfolio.
The Groups financial instruments comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, items that arise directly from its operations and derivative contracts.
The Group enters into short-term and medium-term forward sales contracts for the sale of electricity and the purchase of coal and CO2 emissions allowances.
The Group also enters into interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
Fair value Cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables generally have short times to maturity.
For this reason, their carrying values approximate their fair value.
The Groups borrowings relate to term loans, the carrying amounts of which approximate their fair values by virtue of being floating rate instruments.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market under IAS 39 and recorded in the balance sheet at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 were as follows: As at 31 December 2007 As at 31 December 2006 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Commodity contracts: In less than one year 10.4 144.3 257.0 3.0 In more than one year but not more than two years 0.7 87.0 81.4 In more than two years 0.2 20.7 7.7 Interest rate swaps: In less than one year 1.6 0.3 In more than one year but not more than two years 0.4 3.3 In more than two years 0.3 1.5 Forward foreign currency exchange contracts: In less than one year 3.0 1.0 0.2 3.8 In more than one year but not more than two years In more than two years Total 16.6 253.3 351.1 6.8 Less: non-current portion Commodity contracts 0.9 107.7 89.1 Interest rate swaps 0.7 4.8 Total non-current portion 1.6 107.7 93.9 Current portion 15.0 145.6 257.2 6.8 71 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.
Financial instruments continued The amounts recorded in the income statement in respect of derivatives which are marked-to-market under IAS 39 were as follows: Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m Unrealised gains on derivative contracts recognised in arriving at operating profit 3.3 90.8 The unrealised gains on derivative contracts recorded in the income statements in 2006 and 2007 primarily represent the unwinding of unrealised losses on commodity contracts reflected in the income statement in 2005, prior to hedge accounting being implemented.
For the purposes of IAS 39, the Group put in place appropriate hedge accounting documentation to enable it to achieve hedge accounting for a large proportion of its derivative contracts from 1 July 2005.
As a result, mark-to-market movements on contracts which are considered to be effective hedges are now recognised through the hedge reserve note 24.
Commodity contracts fair value Due to the nature of commodity contracts and the way they are managed, the own use exemption within IAS 39 has been applied to a limited number of them, including the five-and-a-quarter year baseload contract with Centrica which commenced on 1 October 2007.
The fair value of commodity contracts qualifying as derivative financial instruments is calculated by reference to forward market prices which are available at the balance sheet date.
As contracts are generally short term, forward market price curves are available for the duration of the contracts.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the quoted price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
Interest rate swaps fair value The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by discounting the future cash flows using forward interest rate curves at the balance sheet date.
Forward foreign currency exchange contracts fair value The fair value of forward foreign currency exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
Embedded derivatives fair value The Group has also reviewed all contracts for the presence of embedded derivatives.
Where contracts were found to contain embedded derivatives, they were considered to be closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and, therefore, do not require separate valuation from their host contracts.
Risk The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including commodity price risk, counterparty risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of commodity and financial markets and seeks to manage potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by a management committee and treasury function which identify evaluate and hedge financial risks in close co-operation with the Groups trading function under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the price of electricity, the price of coal and other fuels and the price of CO2 emissions allowances.
Price variations and market cycles have historically influenced the financial results of the Group and are expected to continue to do so.
The Group has a policy of making sales of power when profitable compared with marginal costs of fuel and CO2 emissions allowances.
All commitments to sell power under fixed price contracts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of electricity.
The Group purchases coal under either fixed or variable priced contracts with different maturities from a variety of domestic and international sources.
All physical coal purchase contracts transacted at a fixed price and financial coal contracts exchanging floating price coal for fixed price amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of coal.
The Group purchases CO2 emissions allowances under fixed price contracts with different maturity dates from a range of domestic and international sources.
All contracts for the purchase of CO2 emissions allowances are categorised as being held for the Groups own usage requirements and are therefore accounted for on an accruals basis because they are outside the scope of IAS 39.
72 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Commodity price sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to commodity prices for outstanding monetary items at the balance sheet date.
The analysis is based on the Groups commodity financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
A 5% increase or decrease is used as it represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in commodity prices.
If commodity prices had been 5% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2007 would decrease increase by 2.1 million 2006: decrease increase by nil.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to financial coal derivatives: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 57.2 million 2006: decrease increase by 33.0 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of commitments to sell power.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk principally in relation to its outstanding bank debt.
In particular, it is exposed to changes in the LIBOR interest rate of sterling denominated debt, as substantially all of its debt is both denominated in sterling and has a variable LIBOR rate.
The Group mitigates this risk with interest rate hedges on a proportion of its debt facilities.
Information about the Groups instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk and their repayment schedules is included in note 15.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in profit or loss over the loan period.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1% increase or decrease is used as it represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 1% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2007 would decrease increase by 1.8 million 2006: decrease increase by 2.0 million.
This is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings: and other equity reserves would decrease increase by 2.7 million 2006: decrease increase by 3.6 million mainly as a result of the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to repayments of variable rate debt.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency exchange contracts are principally entered into to hedge substantially all of the Groups fixed price international coal purchases in US dollars and CO2 emissions allowances purchases in euros.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising foreign exchange contracts.
Foreign currency sensitivity The Group has concluded that a 5% change in the USD GBP exchange rate or a 5% change in the EUR GBP exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, would not have had a significant impact on the net result for either of the years ended 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006, or on equity as at 31 December 2007 or 31 December 2006.
Both of these percentages represent managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in exchange rates.
73 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 17.
Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The treasury function is responsible for liquidity, funding and settlement management under policies approved by the Board of directors.
Liquidity needs are monitored using regular forecasting of operational cash flows and financing commitments.
The Group maintains a mixture of cash and cash equivalents, long-term debt and committed facilities in order to ensure sufficient funding for business requirements.
Note 15 includes details of undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal.
The following table sets out details of the expected maturity of derivative financial instruments which are marked-to-market under IAS 39 based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows.
Where the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to projected commodity prices, interest rates, or foreign exchange rates as illustrated by the yield or other forward curves existing at the reporting date.

Counterparty risk As the Group relies on third party suppliers for the delivery of coal and other goods and services, it is exposed to the risk of non-performance by these third party suppliers.
The Group purchases a significant portion of its coal requirement under contracts with a number of UK suppliers.
There is a risk that if a large supplier falls into financial difficulty and or fails to deliver against the contracts, there would be additional costs associated with securing coal from other suppliers.
The Group enters into fixed price and fixed margin contracts for the sale of electricity to a number of counterparties.
The failure of one or more of these counterparties to perform their contractual obligations may cause the Group financial distress or increase the risk profile of the Group.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the balance sheet date, as summarised below: As at 31 December 2007 2006 m m Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 59.7 154.8 Trade and other receivables 129.6 171.4 Derivative financial instruments 16.6 351.1 205.9 677.3 74 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by a management committee.
Counterparties without an investment grade rating are normally required to provide credit support in the form of a parent company guarantee, letter of credit, deed of charge, or cash collateral.
Where appropriate the Group has purchased credit default swaps.
The investment of surplus cash is undertaken to maximise the return within Board approved policies.
These policies manage credit risk exposure by setting out minimum rating requirements, maximum investment with any one counterparty and the maturity profile.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of the borrowings disclosed in note 15, cash and cash equivalents in note 13, and equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings in note 26.
The Board continues to monitor developments in the debt markets and is committed to maintaining balance sheet efficiency.
In September 2007 the Board announced its intention to undertake a refinancing of the Groups current debt facilities subject to market conditions.
As a result of continuing turbulence in the debt markets the Board decided to postpone the refinancing until such time as it judges market conditions have improved and the Group will be able to secure more attractive terms.
The capital stucture of the Group is as follows: As at 31 December 2007 2006 m m Borrowings 396.9 476.2 Cash and cash equivalents 59.7 154.8 Net debt 337.2 321.4 Total shareholders equity 361.0 677.1 18.
Provisions Re-instatement m At 1 January 2006 2.0 Unwinding of discount 0.2 At 1 January 2007 2.2 Unwinding of discount 0.2 At 31 December 2007 2.4 The provision for re-instatement represents the estimated decommissioning, demolition and site remediation costs at the end of the useful economic life of the Groups generating assets, on a discounted basis.
An amount equivalent to the initial provision is capitalised within tangible fixed assets and is being depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The provision is estimated using the assumption that the re-instatement will take place between 2039 and 2045.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology at current prices.
The discount rate applied is the pre-tax rate based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital and reflects the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the business.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realised: being either 30% or 28% 2006: 30%.

Following approval at the Annual General Meeting held on 26 April 2007, the share consolidation under which shareholders 16 1 received 64 new ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each for every 67 existing ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each, became effective on 30 April 2007.
The Company also undertook a share consolidation in connection with the interim special dividend paid on 25 October 2006 1 note 8, under which shareholders received 29 new ordinary shares of 11 29 pence each for every 32 existing ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
Share buy-back programme Under a share buy-back programme completed between 7 September 2007 and 13 December 2007, the Company purchased 13,005,304 ordinary shares for an aggregate consideration inclusive of all transaction costs of 83.5 million.
Transaction costs of share purchases under the programme amounted to 0.5 million.
All shares purchased through the share buy-back programme were cancelled.
Issued under employee share schemes On 23 May 2006, the Company issued 157,734 ordinary shares of 10 pence each being the par value at that date to a trust on behalf of qualifying employees under the Groups Share Incentive Plan note 21.
The Company has only one class of ordinary shares, which carry no right to fixed income.
No shareholders have waived their rights to dividends.
Share-based payments Costs recognised in the income statement in relation to share-based payments are as follows: Years ended 31 December 2007 2006 m m SIP 2.2 1.3 ESIP 0.8 0.3 SAYE 0.1 0.1 3.1 1.7 77 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21.
Share-based payments continued Share Incentive Plan SIP Under the 2007 SIP Free share award, the Company purchased a total of 195,810 shares 2006: 157,734 shares issued in April 2007 to be held in trust on behalf of qualifying employees, equating to 305 shares 2006: 254 shares with a cash value of approximately 2,500 2006: 2,000 per employee based on the Companys share price at the time of the award.
The fair value of the 2007 Free share award determined at the award date based on the price paid of 1.6 million was charged to the income statement in full in the year ended 31 December 2007, on the basis that employees were granted specific rights in relation to shares held in trust on their behalf.
Similarly, the fair value of the 2006 Free share award of 1.3 million was charged to the income statement in full in the year ended 31 December 2006.
In March 2007, the SIP was extended by introducing two further elements: Partnership shares and Matching shares.
Qualifying employees can buy up to 1,500 worth subject to an overriding maximum of 10% of salary of Partnership shares out of pre-tax pay in any one tax year.
Matching shares are awarded to employees to match any Partnership shares they buy, in a ratio of one-to-one for the 2007 2008 tax year, with the cost of Matching shares borne by the Group.
As at 31 December 2007, a total of 104,367 Matching shares had been purchased and were held in trust on behalf of qualifying employees.
The fair value of Matching shares awarded up to 31 December 2007 determined at the award dates based on the price paid of 0.8 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over a one-year vesting period Matching shares are forfeited if an employee leaves Drax within one year of the award.
Shares in the Company held under trust and under the Companys control as a result of the SIP i. e. the Matching shares were as follows: Year ended 31 December 2007 Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at Cost at value at value at 1 January acquired transferred 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2007 during year during year 2007 2007 2007 2007 Number Number Number Number 000 000 000 SIP 106,811 2,444 104,367 795 12 631 Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP Under the ESIP, annual awards of performance shares are made at nil consideration to executive directors and other senior staff up to a normal maximum of 100% of salary 200% in exceptional circumstances.
Shares vest according to whether Draxs TSR matches or outperforms an index determined in accordance with the scheme rules over three years.
ESIP awards over 361,582 shares 2006: 390,213 shares were granted to executive directors and other senior staff in 2007, with performance measured over the three years to 31 December 2009 and potential vesting in April 2010.
The fair value of the 2007 ESIP awards determined at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which takes into account the estimated probability of different levels of vesting of 0.9 million, is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period to 19 April 2010.
Similarly, the fair value of the 2006 ESIP award of 1.9 million is being charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the three-year vesting period to 19 September 2009.
Savings-Related Share Option Plan SAYE In July 2006, participation in the SAYE was offered to all qualifying employees.
Options were granted for employees to acquire shares at a price of 6.36 representing a discount of 20% to the prevailing market price determined in accordance with the scheme rules, exercisable at the end of the three and five year savings contracts.
The fair value of the 899,396 options granted in connection with the SAYE of 0.5 million is being charged to the income statement over the life of the respective contracts.
There have been no further offers under the SAYE Plan since that made in July 2006.
78 Drax Group plc Annual report and accounts 2007 For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payments charge for the 2006 SAYE, a Black-Scholes model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model were as follows: As at 31 December 2006 Dividend yield 14.7% Risk-free interest rate 4.8% Volatility 27.2% Expected life of the options three and five years Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price since listing.
The weighted average fair values of share options granted under the 2006 SAYE were: As at 31 December 2006 Pence Three year savings plan 73 Five year savings plan 50 No shares have been issued or repurchased to date with respect to the SAYE or ESIP.
Given that these share-based incentive plans have commenced only recently, the level of forfeitures is not significant.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme.
