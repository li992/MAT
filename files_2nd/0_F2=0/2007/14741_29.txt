Scottish and Southern Energy Annual Report 2007 77 Characteristics of the arrangements Description The contracts are 25 year arrangements to replace ageing street-lighting stock and to subsequently maintain the new assets throughout each Councils areas.
Significant terms The cash flows under the PFI arrangements come from the unitary charge for these services paid by the Councils.
The unitary charge can only be adjusted if performance under the contract falls below the required standards.
Any significant change to the services proposed by either party is subject to a formal change procedure and agreement to such a change is required by the other party.
Nature and extent of rights and obligations The assets are part of the public highway and ownership of the assets remains with the Councils.
The Tay Valley Lighting companies are licenced to replace and maintain the assets for the period of the contract.
This obligation is passed down to Southern Electric Contracting Limited through the operating sub-contract.
Any failure to provide the services to the required standards will result in financial penalties which are taken from the unitary charge.
The companies have 25 year contracts with no extension options.
Termination during this period can be initiated through a number of routes including service provider default, force majeure or the event of a risk becoming uninsurable, authority default, voluntary authority termination, or termination for a prohibited act or breach of refinancing provisions.
In all cases, a formula exists for calculating compensation payments to the service provider.
Throughout the contract period there are a number of circumstances under which the companies could potentially be required to provide additional services: i Changes in the law If circumstances arise where by a change in legislation would mean a change in the way the services are to be provided the companies would be liable for part of the cost of this change.
ii Final survey The Councils have the ability to deduct 20% of the unitary charge in the last two years if an independent survey indicates the assets are unlikely to have a 5-year residual life.
The Groups exposure to unforeseen obligations is insured.
