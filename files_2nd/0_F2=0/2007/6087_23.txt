Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 General information FKI plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand pounds except where otherwise indicated.
2 Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP and these are presented in a separate section of this report on pages 107 to 120.
3 Significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2007 have been prepared on the historic cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and available for sale financial assets which have been measured at fair value.
The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged are adjusted to record changes in the fair values attributable to the risks that are being hedged.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less estimated costs to sell.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of FKI plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March each year, together with the Groups share of the results of associates using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included from or up to the date on which control is transferred to or out of the Group respectively.
c Associates Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Groups carrying amount is reduced to nil and recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of an associate.
d Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
Exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity are taken directly to reserves to the extent that they can be offset against the exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
57 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued d Foreign currency translation continued On consolidation, the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments, of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The income and cash flows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year, with the year end adjustment to closing rates being taken to equity.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation at year end rates of the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings at the beginning of the year are taken to equity.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the determination of profit for the financial year.
Exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and of related hedges are taken to translation reserves in equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has adopted the exemption allowing these cumulative translation differences to be reset to zero at the transition date 1 April 2004 to IFRS.
e Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold property 50 years Short leasehold property over the lease term Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, less costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
f Goodwill Goodwill on business acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the acquirers interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities.
Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill on acquisitions after 31 March 2004 is not amortised and goodwill arising on acquisition before the date of transition to IFRS which was 1 April 2004, is not amortised after that date.
Goodwill existing at the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts as the Group has elected not to restate business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Negative goodwill arising on any acquisition is recognised directly in the income statement.
58 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued g Intangible assets i Research and development costs Research costs are expensed as incurred.
Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is capitalised when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure, the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Any expenditure capitalised is amortised over the lesser of the useful life of the project or three years.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets including those arising from a business combination are amortised over their remaining useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, unless such lives are indefinite.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software 3 years h Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
i Leases Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Group of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
j Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessment of the time value of money, and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
59 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued j Impairment continued If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
k Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, on a first-in first-out basis, and net realisable value after making due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving inventory.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads, based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
l Construction contracts Revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
Stage of completion is determined by the costs incurred to date to the extent that such costs represent progress made on the project.
Cost comprises direct materials and labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity.
The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from construction contract customers, for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less provisions for foreseeable losses exceeds progress billings.
Progress billings not yet paid by customers and retentions are included within trade and other receivables.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to construction contract customers for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits, less recognised foreseeable losses.
m Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
n Pensions and other post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.
Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
60 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued n Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued ii Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance sheet date.
Pension assets are measured at fair value.
The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows: a Within operating profit The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period: The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements to benefits: Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
b Within other finance cost or income The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the period.
The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the beginning of the period: c Within the statement of recognised income and expense On the scheme assets the difference between the expected and actual return on assets: On the scheme liabilities a the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and b the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
o Share-based payment transactions Certain employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuation.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
61 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued o Share-based payment transactions continued Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004. p Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the buyer.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered, by reference to completion of the specific transaction assessed on the basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services to be provided.
Revenue from services provided on a short-term basis is recognised when the service is complete.
Interest income is recognised as the interest accrues using the effective interest method that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
q Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate and cross currency swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges where they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges eg: interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
62 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued q Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued In relation to cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
r Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the temporary differences, can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
s Investments All investments are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given and the costs of acquisition.
After initial recognition, investments which are classified as held for trading or available for sale, are measured at fair value.
Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognised in income.
Gains or losses on available for sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is sold or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement.
Investments classified as held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition, over the period to maturity.
For investments carried at amortised cost, gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the investments are derecognised or impaired.
The fair values of quoted investments are determined by reference to current bid prices.
For investments for which there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference either to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset base of the investment.
63 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued t Interest bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.
Gains and losses are recognised in net profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
u Borrowing costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a major qualifying asset, are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset if the costs are significant and a significant period of time is required to complete the asset.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
v Standards and interpretations not yet applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements which are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted.
The effective date quoted below relates to the annual period beginning on or after: International Accounting Standards Board IAS IFRSs Effective date Amendment to IAS 1: Presentation of financial statements capital disclosures 1 January 2007 Amendment to IAS 23: Borrowing costs 1 January 2009 IFRS 7: Financial instruments disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8: Operating segments 1 January 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 8: Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9: Reassessment of embedded derivatives 1 June 2006 IFRIC 10: Interim financial reporting and impairment 1 November 2006 IFRIC 11: IFRS 2: Group and treasury share transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC 12: Service concession arrangements 1 January 2008 The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the periods of initial application commencing on or after 1 April 2007.
64 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3 Significant accounting policies continued w Key sources of estimation uncertainty In applying the above accounting policies, management has made appropriate estimates and judgements in a number of areas.
The key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are: Post-retirement benefits The determination of the pension and other post-retirement benefits cost and obligation is based on assumptions determined with independent actuarial advice.
The assumptions include discount rate, inflation, pension and salary increases, expected return on scheme assets, mortality and other demographic assumptions.
Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires an estimate of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Deferred income tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, significant judgement is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised which is dependent on the generation of sufficient future taxable profits.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that the benefit will be realised.

A summary of the net book value of goodwill by business segment is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 m m Lifting Products and Services 3.9 4.0 Energy Technology 6.0 1.2 FKI Logistex 345.7 380.3 Hardware 19.5 22.0 375.1 407.5 79 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Goodwill continued The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the Group compares the carrying value net assets plus goodwill of the cash-generating units CGU with their recoverable amounts.
In all cases the recoverable amounts have been determined to be the CGUs value in use and not their fair value, less costs to sell.
Value in use is derived from the most recent financial plans for the next three years approved by the Board and extrapolated cash flows thereafter.
The key assumptions are the risk adjusted discount rate, the long-term growth rate and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs which are based on past experience, expectations of future changes in the market, inflation and the benefits of identified productivity and cost saving initiatives.
The applied pre-tax discount rate, based on a risk adjusted Group weighted average cost of capital WACC, is 8.9% 2006: 9.2% for all CGUs, except Logistex where 11% 2006: 9.2% has been applied.
The applied long-term growth rates are within the range of external industry growth rates at 1.53% 2006: 1.53%.
With regard to the assessment of the value in use of the Lifting Products and Services, Hardware and Energy Technology CGUs, management believes that no reasonably possible change in the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of any unit to exceed the recoverable amount.
For the Logistex CGU, the assessment of recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount of goodwill and operating assets by 49 million 2006: 167 million.
It is estimated that an increase in the discount rate of 1% to 12% or the realisation of less than 76% of the benefits of the productivity and cost saving initiatives included in the three year plan period would give a value in use equal to the carrying amount.
Management believes that no other reasonably possible change in key assumptions would give a value in use equal to the carrying amount.

At 31 March 2007 FKI Engineering Limited, whose statutory accounts have been prepared under UK GAAP, had gross assets of 1,683.8 million 2006: 1,724.6 million, net assets of 1,206.6 million 2006: 1,228.0 million and a profit after tax of 68.6 million for the year then ended 2006: 82.0 million.
At 31 March 2007 FKI Industries Inc. whose unaudited special purpose financial statements have been prepared under US GAAP, had gross assets of US Dollar 447.5 million 2006: US Dollar 537.3 million, a net liabilities of US Dollar 166.0 million 2006: US Dollar 204.5 million and net profit of US Dollar 23.7 million for the year then ended 2006: US Dollar 74.2 million.
FKI plc has represented that it will continue to provide any necessary funding and liquidity to enable FKI Industries Inc. to satisfy its obligations, including repayment of third party borrowings.
At 31 March 2007 the guaranteed bank borrowings of US Dollar 25.0 million 2006: nil were drawn under the Companys 150.0 million syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility maturing on 26 July 2007, being guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries FKI Engineering Limited and FKI Industries Inc. Drawdowns under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging between 0.5% and 0.7% depending upon the level of the Companys debt.
On 5 June 2007 the Company entered into a commitment with a number of relationship banks to provide a 120 million revolving credit facility in replacement of the existing 150 million revolving credit facility that matures on 26 July 2007.
This new 120 million facility, which runs until 1 April 2009, will provide working capital funding during a phase when the Companys operational performance is expected to benefit from strengthening end-markets and further strategic re-alignment of the portfolio.
It is expected that this will lead to improved financial metrics allowing the Company to subsequently refinance its maturing debt obligations in a cost-effective manner.
The terms and conditions under the new 120 million facility are very similar to the previous facility, but with some additional headroom under the financial covenants.
The US Dollar 97.5 million 2006: US Dollar 173.5 million guaranteed US private placement loan notes are issued by the Companys subsidiary FKI Industries Inc. and guaranteed by the Company.

There have been no changes in the above swaps during the course of the year.
Net investment hedges At 31 March 2007 the Company held a number of cross-currency swaps that were designated as net investment hedges of investments in non-Sterling subsidiary companies.
These swaps protect against changes in exchange rates affecting the Sterling value of subsidiaries that are located in the United States, Canada, Denmark and the Eurozone.

The Company also holds a number of other interest swaps that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
These LIBOR-in-arrears swaps reduce the Companys exposure to floating US Dollar interest rates, on a total of US Dollars 133.7 million, through a combination of interest rate caps and spreading of reference dates for interest rate resets.
Changes in the fair value of these swaps are booked to profit or loss.
There have been no changes in these swaps during the year.

b Foreign currency risk The Group operates globally with the majority of its profits outside the UK.
It has significant investments outside the UK with the largest investments being in North America followed by Europe.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet and reduce cash flow risk the Group has financed most of its investments in the USA, Canada and Europe by borrowing in US Dollars, Canadian Dollars, Euros and Danish Krone.
Some of this funding is achieved by directly borrowing the relevant currency whilst some is achieved through cross-currency swaps which can be more efficient and reduce costs and credit exposure.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures on committed, and occasionally forecast, receipts and payments in foreign currencies.

The Groups borrowings exhibit some seasonal variations during the year and for that reason the Board requires long-term funding and committed borrowing facilities to always exceed actual and projected debt figures by at least 10%.
At the year end 78% 2006: 78% of the Groups committed facilities were drawn.
Of the 616.9 million 2006: 692.2 million committed borrowing facilities available to the Group, the undrawn committed facilities were as follows: 2007 2006 m m Expiring in less than one year 137.3 Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years 150.0 As at 31 March 137.3 150.0 The Group also has a number of uncommitted loan and overdraft facilities at its disposal.

With the exception of amounts related to vacant leasehold properties, the provisions are generally utilised within one to two years.
The vacant leasehold property provisions will be utilised in between one and nine years.
The insurance and litigation provisions represents managements best estimate of the likely outcome.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of the nature of such liabilities it is difficult to give an indication of the timing of their settlement but generally this would be between one and ten years.

The unrecognised deferred tax asset is 34.9 million 2006: 47.7 million.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of liabilities that might arise on the distribution of available overseas reserves of subsidiary undertakings, except to the extent that the decision to remit such profits has been taken.
Where a liability has not been recognised, it is because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
At the balance sheet date the aggregate amount of such temporary differences for which deferred tax has not been recognised was 22.4 million 2006: 18.3 million.
32 Finance and operating leases Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts The Group leases certain of its property, plant and equipment under finance leases.
These leases have an average duration of between three and ten years.
The majority of the leases are on a fixed repayment basis and where escalation clauses exist they are linked to LIBOR.
No arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 m m Not later than one year 0.8 0.9 After one year but not more than five years 3.2 4.2 4.0 5.1 Less finance charges allocated to future periods 0.1 0.2 Present value of minimum lease payments 3.9 4.9 92 FKI plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Finance and operating leases continued Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts continued The present value of minimum lease payments is as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 m m Not later than one year 0.8 0.9 After one year but not more than five years 3.1 4.0 3.9 4.9 Commitments under operating leases The total future minimum rental payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2007 2006 m m Not later than one year 10.3 9.6 After one year but not more than five years 27.0 26.7 After five years 19.8 17.5 57.1 53.8 33 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits a Defined contribution pension schemes The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to these defined contribution pension schemes in the year, which were the same as the amount charged to the income statement, amounted to 8.3 million 2006: 7.8 million.
b Defined benefit and other post-retirement benefits The main pension schemes operated by the Group are in the United Kingdom and North America and are defined benefit in type.
These are funded schemes, where the future liabilities for benefits are provided for by the accumulation of assets held externally to the Group in separate trustee administered funds.
The cost of these schemes is determined in accordance with IAS 19 with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries on the basis of formal actuarial valuations using the projected unit method.
In line with normal business practice, these valuations are undertaken triennially in the United Kingdom and annually in the United States.
These valuations are based on the full actuarial valuation as of 31 December 2005, updated at 31 March 2007 by independent actuaries.
The dates of the most recent full actuarial valuations, on which the amounts in the financial statements are based, were as follows: Location Date of valuation FKI Group Pension Scheme UK 31 December 2005 FKI Industries Inc.

Exchange reserve The exchange reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations.
It also includes the effect of translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
Share-based payments accrual IFRS 2 requires that an expense for share-based payments be recognised in the income statement based on the fair value at the date of grant.
This expense is recognised over the vesting period of the options.
A share-based payment accrual is recognised as part of equity.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge.
37 Share-based payments Disclosures of the share-based payments offered to employees are set out below.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the Group has recognised an expense in respect of all equity settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.
The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments for the year ended 31 March 2007 was 1.4 million 2006: 1.4 million.
a Share option scheme The Group operates an executive share option scheme.
All executive options granted up to and including 31 March 2007 may only be exercised subject to a performance condition that the Groups growth in earnings per share must exceed the UK retail price index by 9% or more over a three year period, subject to re-testing in subsequent years from a rolling base.
The re-testing condition was removed for options granted after April 2004.
The contractual lifetime of the options is ten years.
For options granted from 1 April 2006 none will vest for an earnings per share less than the retail price index plus 12% over the three years movement period.
For earnings per share at or greater than retail price index plus 12%, awards will vest on a straight-line basis.
Details of the vesting levels are included in the Remuneration report.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at 31 March 2007 is 87.0p to 116.5p 2006: 87.0p to 116.5p.
The options exercised during the year relate to options exercised by employees of disposed of companies and employees made redundant.
The fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period and is estimated on the date of the grant by Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow Limited using the binomial pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions.
Assumptions are made for each separate grant but weighted averages have been disclosed because share options were granted at different dates within certain years.

In addition, there are contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business in connection with the completion of contracts within specification, including responsibilities for maintenance.
The Group is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business, including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.
The claims giving rise to such proceedings are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third-party indemnities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group's financial results.
42 Related party transactions Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
The Groups associate is Mediterranean Power Electric Company Limited and no transactions were made between the Group and its associate during the years ended 31 March 2007 and 31 March 2006.
