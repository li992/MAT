Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Principal accounting policies Rathbone Brothers Plc is a public company incorporated in Great Britain.
The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRS.
The Company has elected to prepare its individual accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the UK UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 114 to 120.
The following standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or later periods but that the Group has not early adopted: IAS 23 Amendment, Borrowing costs effective from 1 January 2009.
The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
The Group will apply IAS 23 Amended from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is currently not applicable to the Group as there are no qualifying assets.
IAS 27 revised, Consolidated and separate financial statements requires the effects of all transactions with noncontrolling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control.
They will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
It is not expected that this revised standard, which applies with effect from 1 July 2009, will have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations introduces some significant changes for acquisition accounting.
The changes impact on the initial and subsequent valuation of purchase consideration, the calculation of goodwill and the treatment of transaction costs.
The revised standard is applicable to business combinations occurring in accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009 and will be applied by the Group from that date.
The impact of the standard on future acquisitions is not readily determinable.
IFRS 8, Operating segments effective from 1 January 2009.
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14 and aligns segment reporting with the requirements of the US standard SFAS 131, Disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.
The new standard requires segment information to be presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
Implementation of the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Groups accounts.
Some amendments to the disclosures made for segmental performance are likely although it is not expected that the number of reportable segments will change.
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions effective from 1 March 2007 provides guidance on whether share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities for example, options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equity-settled or cash-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone accounts of the parent and Group companies.
This interpretation does not have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction effective from 1 January 2008.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of any surplus in the Groups defined benefit pension schemes that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups accounts.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures During the year, the Group has adopted IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures and the related amendments to IAS 1 on capital disclosures.
Accordingly, the Group has made additional disclosures in relation to capital, financial instruments and risk management policies and procedures.
Adoption of this standard does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
As required by IFRS 7, comparative disclosures have also been made.
The Group has also adopted IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 and IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment during the year.
Adoption of either interpretation has had no impact on the Groups accounts in the current or prior years.
The comparative balances have been restated to be consistent with the current year presentation of the Translation Reserve as a component of Other Reserves.
In prior years, the Translation Reserve was included as a component of retained earnings.
Comparative balances have also been restated to reflect the exclusion of held to maturity debt securities from cash equivalents in the cash flow statement.
This amendment has had no impact on profit or equity.
Basis of presentation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in the consolidated accounts.
70 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries, together the Group, made up to 31 December each year.
Subsidiaries are all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest, generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether an entity is a subsidiary of the Company.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Rathbone International Finance BV, which is effectively controlled by the Company, although the Company does not own any of the entitys share capital.
Impairment At each balance sheet date, the Group considers the carrying amounts of its assets with finite lives to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables are considered individually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the higher of fair value less any cost to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
The recoverable amount of held to maturity investment securities and loans and receivables is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate of the asset on recognition.
Impairment of available for sale securities is calculated as the cumulative loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity at the time that objective evidence of impairment is identified.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss excluding goodwill subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
An impairment loss in respect of a held to maturity security or loans and receivables is reversed if the subsequent increase can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
An impairment loss in respect of an investment in equity instruments classified as available for sale is not reversed through profit or loss.
If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment is reversed through profit or loss.
Interest income and expenses Interest income and expense are recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost and for available for sale debt instruments using the effective interest method.
Interest payable and receivable on derivative financial instruments is included within net interest income.
71 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Interest income and expenses continued The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability.
When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument but does not consider future credit losses.
The calculation includes all fees and interest paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts.
Once a financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been written down as a result of an impairment loss, interest income is recognised using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss.
Dividend income Dividend income from final dividends on equity securities is accounted for on the date the security becomes ex-dividend.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Fees and commissions Portfolio and other management advisory and service fees are recognised over the period the service is provided.
Asset management fees are recognised rateably over the period the service is provided.
Commissions receivable and payable are accounted for in the period in which they are earned.
To the extent that retained initial charge income received on the sale of units arises from an identifiable brokerage service, the income is recognised on the performance of that service.
Other retained initial charges are deferred and recognised as income on a straight line basis over the estimated average life of the unit holding.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following bases: Leasehold property: over the lease term Plant, equipment and computer hardware: over three to five years The assets residual lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with the carrying amount.
These are included in the income statement.
Intangible assets a Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or when other occasions or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the profit and loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is allocated to groups of cash generating units that correspond with the Groups segments, as these represent the lowest level within the Group at which management monitor goodwill for purposes of impairment testing.
Cash generating units are identified as the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributed amount of goodwill that has not been subject to impairment is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
72 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Intangible assets continued b Computer software and software development costs Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
These costs are amortised on the basis of the expected useful lives three to four years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, which are expected to generate economic benefits exceeding costs beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised using the straight line method over their useful lives not exceeding four years.
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programs that are not recognised as assets are recognised as an expense as incurred.
c Client relationships Client relationships acquired are shown at historical cost.
Those in respect of business combinations are initially recognised at fair value.
Client relationships have a finite useful life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line method to allocate the cost of the client lists over their estimated useful lives 5 15 years.
Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classification of financial assets is determined at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short term or if so designated.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading and are reported within other assets or other liabilities.
b Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services to a debtor or purchases a loan with no intention of trading the receivable.
c Held-to-maturity Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Groups management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity, other than those that meet the definition of loans and receivables or that the Group has classified as available for sale or fair value through profit or loss.
d Available-for-sale Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
Available-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates or equity prices.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are recognised on trade date the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Loans are recognised when cash is advanced to the borrowers.
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or been effectively transferred, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity except for changes arising from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which are recognised as income or expenditure in the income statement for monetary assets and directly in equity for non-monetary assets, until the financial asset is sold, derecognised or impaired at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity should be recognised in the income statement.
However, interest calculated using the effective interest method is recognised in the income statement.
The fair values of quoted financial instruments in active markets are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other valuation techniques commonly used by market participants.
73 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Deposits and borrowings All deposits and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, deposits and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discounts or premia on settlement.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Work in progress Trust work in progress is included within other assets and is valued at the expected recoverable amount, including an appropriate portion of profit, calculated by reference to the stage of completion of the service rendered.
The corresponding income is recognised within fees and commissions receivable.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event which it is probable will result in an outflow of economic benefits that can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation.
The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised within interest expense.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring which has been notified to affected parties.
Foreign currencies The Groups functional and presentational currency is sterling.
Transactions in currencies other than the relevant Group entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary financial assets carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated into the Groups presentational currency at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in equity within the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Gains and losses arising on translation are taken to the Groups translation reserve.
The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments denominated in a currency other than the Groups functional currency arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS as non-monetary foreign currency items and they are translated using the exchange rate applied on the date of acquisition.
Retirement benefit costs The cost of providing benefits under defined benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside of profit and loss and are presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the amended benefits become vested.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
74 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 1 Principal accounting policies continued Taxation continued Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences may be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or negative goodwill for which amortisation is not deductible for tax purposes or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction, which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the liability is settled or when the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits which may be accessed without penalty.
Cash equivalents comprise short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group engages in equity settled share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
The fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in the income statement reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
Segmental reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Direct costs are allocated to the segment that generated the cost.
Indirect costs are allocated to reporting segments so as to reflect the proportion of the cost that each segment has generated, on a pro rata basis.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustees and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
These assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
75 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Fiduciary activities continued The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding liability to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Financial guarantees Financial guarantees issued by the Group are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Retirement benefit obligations The Group makes estimates about a range of long-term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 6,452,000 are given in note 27.
Long-term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligation to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 27.
Impairment of goodwill The Group makes estimates in relation to the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated in determining whether goodwill is impaired.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was 70,536,000.
The assumptions underlying the value in use calculation are set out in note 18.
There has been no impairment of goodwill in prior years.
Share-based payments In determining the fair value of equity settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgements must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value of awards is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on further estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, employee turnover, the timing with which options will be exercised and future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Such assumptions are based on publicly available information, where available, and reflect market expectations and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
Different assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially affect the reported value of sharebased payments.
The assumptions used are set out in note 28.
Income recognition Revenue in the Trust and Tax business is calculated by reference to the estimated stage of completion of the service rendered.
Estimates are also made as to the recoverability of work in progress and debtors in relation to this income.
At the year end, total work in progress and debtors for Trust and Tax services amounted to 13,363,000 2006: 11,372,000.
Conversely, very little judgement is required in the recognition of income arising from the Investment Management and Unit Trusts businesses due to the close proximity of billing dates to the year end and the inherently non-judgemental nature of interest accrual calculations.
3 Segmental information a Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into three operating divisions: Investment Management, Unit Trusts and Trust and Tax Services.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Transactions between the business segments are on normal commercial terms and conditions.
Intra-segment income constitutes trail commission.
Revenues and expenses are allocated to the business segment that originated the transaction.
Revenues and expenses that are not directly orginated by a business segment are reported as unallocated.
Centrally incurred expenses are allocated to business segments on an appropriate pro-rata basis.
Segment assets and liabilities comprise operating assets and liabilities, being the majority of the balance sheet, but exclude items such as taxation and borrowings.

The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
Both schemes continue on a closed basis with the existing assets remaining invested thereunder.
90 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 27 Retirement benefit obligations continued The schemes are valued by independent actuaries every three years using the projected unit credit method which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at: Last full actuarial valuation as at: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2004 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2005 .
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The principal actuarial assumptions used, which reflect the different membership profiles of the schemes, were: 2007 2006 2007 2006 Laurence Laurence Rathbone Rathbone Keen Keen 1987 1987 Scheme Scheme Scheme Scheme Rate of increase in salaries 4.55% 4.15% 4.55% 4.15% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.60% 3.50% 3.20% 2.90% Rate of increase of deferred pensions 3.30% 2.90% 3.30% 2.90% Discount rate 5.70% 5.20% 5.70% 5.20% Expected return on scheme assets 6.10% 6.21% 7.10% 7.09% Inflation assumption 3.30% 2.90% 3.30% 2.90% 5% for service prior to April 2001 The assumed duration of the liabilities for both schemes is 25 years 2006: 25 years.
The overall expected return on scheme assets is a weighted average of the returns expected on each class of asset held by the scheme, as disclosed below.
Normal retirement age is 65 for members of the Laurence Keen Scheme and 60 for members of the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
The assumed life expectancy for the membership of both schemes is based on the PA92 actuarial tables.
In 2007, the assumption for life expectancy was updated to take account of recent and expected future improvements in life expectancy by using the Medium Cohort projection, rated up by 2 years.
The assumed life expectations on retirement were: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Males Females Males Females Retiring today aged 60 24.7 27.7 24.7 27.6 aged 65 20.0 22.9 20.0 22.9 Retiring in 20 years aged 60 25.9 28.7 25.9 28.7 aged 65 21.1 23.9 21.1 23.9 The amount included in the balance sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of the schemes is as follows: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Laurence Rathbone Laurence Rathbone Keen 1987 2007 Keen 1987 2006 Scheme Scheme Total Scheme Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Present value of defined benefit obligations 10,301 60,274 70,575 10,423 53,982 64,405 Fair value of scheme assets 9,708 54,415 64,123 8,996 44,646 53,642 Deficit in schemes 593 5,859 6,452 1,427 9,336 10,763 91 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 27 Retirement benefit obligations continued The amounts recognised in the income statement, within operating expenses, are as follows: 2007 2007 2006 2006 Laurence Rathbone Laurence Rathbone Keen 1987 2007 Keen 1987 2006 Scheme Scheme Total Scheme Scheme Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Current service cost 3,083 3,083 3,445 3,445 Interest cost 532 2,897 3,429 567 2,571 3,138 Expected return on scheme assets 551 3,407 3,958 480 2,655 3,135 19 2,573 2,554 87 3,361 3,448 Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of recognised income and expense.

30 Financial risk management The Group has identified the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority the FSA in its application of the Capital Requirements Directive.
The Group categorises its financial risks into three areas: i credit risk: ii liquidity risk: and iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, currency risk and price risk.
The sections below outline the Groups risk appetite and explain how it defines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks that the Group faces, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to date information systems.
The Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the board of directors the Board.
The Board delegates the implementation of risk monitoring, management and mitigation policies to the boards of directors of the Groups operating subsidiaries and certain of the boards standing committees.
The principal committees that have responsibility for the identification, mitigation and management of risks are the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Risk Management Committee and the Banking Committee, which is a standing committee of the board of directors of Rathbone Investment Management Limited the RIM Board.
97 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 30 Financial risk management continued The Treasury Department, reporting through the Banking Committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group Treasury Manual and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its Banking, Treasury, Trust and Pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds with other banks and holding interest bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan books and guarantees given on clients behalf.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are fully secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group does not employ a formalised internal ratings system for the assessment of credit exposures, but categorises its exposures based on the long-term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trust businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances of 1,123,000 were past due but not impaired at 31 December 2007 2006: 2,309,000.
No settlement balances were impaired at the balance sheet date 2006: nil.
Loans and advances to banks and debt securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit and government bonds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of surplus investment management client cash, which is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long-term rating of A by Fitch.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis and reviewed by the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
The Banking Committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its Investment Management operations the Investment Management loan book and via Rathbone International Finance B. V. the Rathbone International Finance loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the Trust and Tax and Pensions Advisory businesses Trust and pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short-term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the Banking Committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans and short term overdrafts are provided as a service to Investment Management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name and are advanced for a maximum of one year.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted if required.
A total lending exposure limit is set for the Investment Management loan book.
The Banking Committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where necessary, repayment plans are established with clients before the loan becomes overdue or uncovered.
98 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2007 30 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued At 31 December, the total lending exposure limit for the Investment Management loan book was 25,000,000 2006: 75,000,000 of which 11,889,000 had been advanced 2006: 48,177,000 and a further 4,492,000 had been committed 2006: 14,768,000. c Rathbone International Finance loan book Loans are also provided to non-UK borrowers to assist trust structures where the Group acts as trustee or provides some form of advisory role.
Such loans are backed by loans to the Group from third parties which are on identical repayment and interest rate repricing terms.
Loans are secured either by a legal charge over client cash or other assets under the Groups control, or by waiver of right of recall from the third-party lender in the event that the borrower is unable to repay.
New loan applications and applications to extend existing facilities under the Rathbone International Finance loan book are reviewed by the directors of Rathbone International Finance B. V. and require pre-approval by the chief executive of the trust and tax business.
At 31 December loans outstanding in the Rathbone International Finance loan book totalled 14,343,000 2006: 14,247,000. d Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Management Committees of the Groups Trust and Pension Advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
Derivatives The Group makes use of derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk see note 23.
The Group maintains control limits on net open derivative positions i. e. the difference between purchase and sale contracts, by both amount and term.
At any one time, the amount subject to credit risk is limited to the current fair value of instruments that are favourable to the Group i. e. contracts with a positive fair value, which in relation to derivatives is only a small fraction of the notional value of the contract.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at balance sheet date on a case-by-case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors, are set out in note 16.

For on-balance sheet assets, the exposures set out above are based on net carrying amounts as reported in the balance sheet.
As shown above, 25.9% of the total maximum exposure is derived from loans and advances to banks and customers 2006: 24.1% and 68.4% represents investments in debt securities 2006: 68.1%.
Included within the investment management loan book at 31 December 2006 were mortgage loans of 6,486,000, which were secured against properties.
The mortgages were acquired with the banking book of the private banking business of Dexia Banque Internationale Luxembourg S. A. London Branch on 6 April 2006.
These loans were not impaired at 31 December 2006 and no collateral thereon had been repossessed.
There were no outstanding mortgages at 31 December 2007 following the sale in the year of the private banking business acquired from Dexia Banque International Luxembourg S. A. London Branch.

The Banking Committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short-term liquidity requirements in such as way as to minimise financial risk.
The Treasury Department has primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the Groups liquidity policy, which requires that Rathbone Investment Management the Bank maintains a surplus of immediately realisable assets over its liabilities such that all known and potential cash obligations can be met.
Liquidity mismatches are monitored on a daily basis against the liquidity limits set by the Banking Committee and the FSAs liquidity mismatch guidelines.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by holding marketable instruments which are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates a strict set of criteria for counterparties to ensure that investments are liquid and are with high quality counterparties, defined as those who have been awarded a long-term rating of A or above by Fitch.

The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual, undiscounted cash flows, whereas the Group manages the inherent liquidity risk based on expected undiscounted cash flows.
Derivative cash flows derivatives settled on a net basis As described in note 23 the Group employs Forward Rate Agreements in managing interest rate risk.
The Groups liquidity risk in relation to net settled derivative contracts is limited to the fair value of unsettled contracts.
All unsettled derivative contracts at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 settled within 3 months.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the Banking Committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is rising and shortens it when the yield curve is falling.
The table overleaf shows the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest bearing assets.
At 31 December 2007, the Bank had 902.3 million 2006: 626.0 million of sterling liabilities averaging 3 days 2006: 4 days to repricing which were matched by sterling assets averaging 50 days 2006: 96 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 47 days 2006: 92 days.
The total potential impact on profit after tax and equity was 825,000 2006: 1,105,000 at the balance sheet date for a 1% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The impact of the Groups forward rate agreements is to reduce this exposure by 35,000 2006: 193,000.
Foreign exchange risk The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Group is also subject to a structural currency exposure on its net investments in overseas subsidiaries primarily in Switzerland, Singapore and the British Virgin Islands.
The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign currency risk and, therefore, no sensitivity analysis is presented.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.

The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 17.
At 31 December 2007, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 6,948,000 2006: 6,152,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 695,000 2006: 615,000 there would be no impact on profit after tax.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 17.
31 Capital management Capital is defined as the total of share capital, share premium, retained earnings and other reserves.
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the FSA in the UK.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to comply with the capital requirements set by the regulators of the banking and other regulated markets where the entities within the Group operate: to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored daily by the Groups management, employing techniques based on the guidelines developed by the Basel Committee and the European Community Directives, as implemented by the FSA in the UK, for supervisory purposes.
The FSA requires each bank and banking group to maintain a ratio of total regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets at or above a level individually determined for each institution.
The Groups regulatory capital as managed by its central Group Treasury is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets: and Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available for sale.
Risk-weighted assets are measured by means of a hierarchy of five risk weights classified according to the nature of and reflecting an estimate of credit, market and other risks associated with each asset and counterparty, taking into account any eligible collateral or guarantees.
A similar treatment is adopted for off-balance sheet exposures, with some adjustments to reflect the more contingent nature of the potential losses.
In addition, other regulatory capital requirements are imposed on certain of the Groups subsidiaries by regulatory authorities responsible for supervisory matters in other markets and jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.
These regulatory requirements are principally expenditure-based requirements, which require the individual subsidiaries to maintain a level of regulatory capital in excess of a set percentage of annual qualifying expenditure.
With effect from 1 January 2008, the Group is required to comply with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive also known as Basel II, which has affected the methodology used to determine the Groups regulatory capital requirements.
