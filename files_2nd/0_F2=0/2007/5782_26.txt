These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Principal activities are as follows: Regional businesses provide services which are primarily driven by customer operating expenditure.
Customer requirements are often for a short period of time, and delivery is made through, and supported by, the Groups locally established infrastructure.
Global businesses provide products and services which are primarily driven by customer capital expenditure.
These products and services, which are often based upon bespoke engineering or technology based solutions, are delivered remotely over a longer term period of time and are typically for offshore projects.
