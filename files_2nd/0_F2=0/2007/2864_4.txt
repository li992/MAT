We believe capex at or below 4% is sustainable for the foreseeable future.
There are currently no indications of significant capex requirements in our business forecasts or bid pipeline.
But we would not rule out the possibility of exceeding 4% if we saw an exceptional opportunity to use our financial strength as a competitive advantage.
Transforming TV Licensing In July 2002 the BBC transferred the management of theTV Licence scheme from the Post Office then Consignia to Capita.
Our role includes processing queries, applications and payments, maintaining an accurate licence database and identifying licence evaders.
330,000 more licence sales in two years A dedicated team oversaw the transfer of 1,500 staff to Capita.
But we felt the existing operation was insufficient to deliver the service, so during the transition phase we designed, built and staffed a new customer contact centre in Darwen and movedTV Licensing's head office and 600 staff to new premises in Bristol.
Since then weve moved from licence Transfer of 1,500 New customer enforcement to a more proactive, sales focused staff to Capita contact centre approach, including a successful sales operation which has created 110 new jobs.
Working closely with our partners, weve reduced the rate of evasion from 5.7% to 5.1% and raised the proportion of Direct Debit customers by 21%.
In the past two years weve also generated an extra 330,000TV licence sales.
