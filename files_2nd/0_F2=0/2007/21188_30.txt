2 Presentation changes a Change to definition of operating profit IFRS operating profit is one of the key indicators of performance for the Group and we have changed its definition to provide greater clarity and insight into the factors driving our results, in particular the impact of economic volatility from the underlying business performance.
The new definition uses expected rates of investment return to report the operating profit of our long-term savings business, thus bringing this business into line with the way we report our general insurance and health operating profit.
It also brings the methodology used for the IFRS basis into closer alignment with that used for the European Embedded Value EEV basis, which is the industrys alternative performance measure.
The change in definition does not affect the underlying performance, the economics of our business, the profit before tax attributable to shareholders or the profit for the year being restated.
It only changes the allocation of profit between operating and non-operating elements.
The key changes to our definition of IFRS operating profit are: i Operating profit is now based on the investment returns that the Group expects to make on the financial investments that back the shareholder and policyholder funds of its long-term business over the reporting period, rather than the actual returns on these investments.
The difference between the expected return and the actual return on investments, and the corresponding impact on liabilities, is shown below the operating profit line.
ii The amortisation of acquired value of in-force business AVIF on both insurance and investment contracts is now included within operating profit.
This change matches the emergence of benefit from the acquired book with the associated amortisation expense.
iii The criteria for treating an item as an adjustment, outside operating profit, have been refined to limit these to significant items only.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme and other levies are now included in operating profit.
iv The result for Norwich Union Life Services has been reclassified as long-term business instead of other operations, to match its treatment under EEV.
The table below sets out the effect of the above changes to IFRS operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2006: Effect of 132 restating the As definition of reported IFRS operating Restated Financial 2006 profit 2006 statements m m m Operating profit before tax attributable to shareholders profits Long-term business 1,896 562 1,334 Fund management 155 155 General insurance and health 1,680 6 1,686 Other: Other operations and regional costs 80 55 25 Corporate centre 160 160 Group debt costs and other interest 381 381 Operating profit before adjusting items and tax attributable to shareholders profits 3,110 501 2,609 Adjusted for the following: Investment return variances and economic assumption changes on long-term business 401 401 Impairment of goodwill 94 94 Amortisation and impairment of acquired value of in-force business 100 100 Amortisation and impairment of intangibles 70 6 64 Short-term fluctuation in return on investments backing general insurance and health business 149 149 Profit on the disposal of subsidiaries and associates 222 222 Integration and restructuring costs 246 246 Financial Services Compensation Scheme and other levies 6 6 Profit before tax attributable to shareholders profits 2,977 2,977 Tax attributable to shareholders profits Operating profit 725 80 645 Other activities 137 80 57 588 588 Profit for the year 2,389 2,389 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 2 Presentation changes continued b Restatement of prior year figures i Gross up for cash collateral received The Group enters into stock lending transactions and receives cash or non-cash collateral to reduce the Groups exposure to counterparty credit risk.
Collateral received in the form of cash is then lent out at market rates of interest.
During 2007, we identified that certain cash collateral transactions should have been historically recognised on the balance sheet, with a corresponding obligation to return this collateral, instead of showing a net nil position.
As a result, the figures for loan assets and payables and other financial liabilities as at 31 December 2006 have been restated by increasing them both by 2,129 million.
The equivalent adjustment at 1 January 2006, the start of the comparative period, would have been to increase both loan assets and payables and other financial liabilities by 120 million.
In addition, we identified that the interest paid on cash collateral received and the interest earned from onlending this cash had previously been offset and reported as net interest income.
The 2006 comparative figures have therefore been restated in order to report this interest expense and interest income separately, by increasing both by 17 million.
Neither of these adjustments has any impact on profit for the year, operating profit or earnings per share in 2006, nor on retained earnings, net assets or total equity at either 1 January 2006 or 31 December 2006. ii Restatement of cash equivalents As described in accounting policy X, cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments which normally have maturity dates of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
During the year, we have reviewed the application of this policy to all such investments, as a result of which we have determined that certain investments, previously classified as cash equivalents, would be more appropriately classified as financial investments.
The application of this review to prior year balances has led to a reduction of the cash equivalents balance at 31 December 2006 by 1,425 million, with a corresponding increase in the debt securities total of the same amount.
This restatement has no impact on net assets or total equity.
The effect on the opening balances in the prior year is to reduce cash equivalents and increase debt securities by 1,444 million.
The effect on the cash flow statement is therefore to reduce the prior year cash flows from operating activities by 19 million.
3 Subsidiaries This note provides details of the acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries that the Group has made during the year, together with details of businesses held for sale at the year end.
The principal Group subsidiaries are listed on page 268 to 269. a Acquisitions i Erasmus Group On 26 March 2007, the Groups Dutch subsidiary, Delta Lloyd, acquired 100% of the shares in Erasmus Groep BV 133 Erasmus in the Netherlands.
Erasmus writes both general insurance and long-term business, and the acquisition has further strengthened Delta Lloyds position in the Dutch insurance market.
Financial statements The Erasmus acquisition has not given rise to any goodwill on acquisition.
The relevant calculation is as follows: Purchase cost: m Cash paid 53 Attributable costs 1 Total consideration 54 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Subsidiaries continued The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business on insurance contracts 6 6 Intangible assets 2 18 20 Investments 411 5 416 Loans 204 16 220 Reinsurance assets 33 33 Receivables and other financial assets 22 22 Prepayments and accrued income 13 13 Cash and cash equivalents 35 35 Other assets 31 1 32 Total assets 751 46 797 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 674 20 694 Borrowings 15 15 Provisions 4 6 10 Tax liabilities 1 3 4 Other liabilities 20 20 Total liabilities 714 29 743 Total net assets acquired 37 17 54 Goodwill arising on acquisition The value of Erasmuss distribution channels has been identified as a separate intangible asset and valued by an independent third party at 8 million, using estimated post-tax cash flows and discount rates.
It has been assessed as having a life of 20 years and is being amortised on a straight-line basis over that period.
As permitted by IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, an intangible asset of 12 million has also been recognised for the impact of discounting the non-life insurance liabilities, to bring them to fair value.
This intangible asset will be amortised over the life of the relevant non-life insurance contracts.
The assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date in the table above are stated at their provisional values, and may be amended in 2008, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
The results of Erasmus have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 134 26 March 2007, and have contributed 5 million to the consolidated profit before tax.
Financial statements ii Bancassurance partnership with Cajamurcia On 6 June 2007, the Group announced that it had entered into a long-term bancassurance agreement with Spanish savings bank Caja fide Ahorros fide Murcia Cajamurcia that will enhance the Groups leading position in the Spanish life market.
Cajamurcia will provide exclusive access to its network of branches to Caja Murcia Vida y Pensiones, fide Seguros y Reaseguros SA Cajamurcia Vida, the newly-created life insurance company jointly-owned by the Group and Cajamurcia, to sell insurance and pension products.
Regulatory approval to write new business was received on 21 November 2007 and the new company began trading on 30 November 2007.
On signing the agreement, the Group acquired 5% of the share capital of Cajamurcia Vida and Cajamurcia granted the Group a call option over a further 45% of the shares in this company which may be exercised in the two month period following the first anniversary of the agreement being signed.
Further consideration of 69 million would be payable on exercising the option, with additional amounts of up to 187 million payable, dependant on the performance of the new company.
If it does not exercise this option during this period, the Group has granted a call option over its 5% holding to Cajamurcia.
The Group paid 8 million for the initial 5% holding on completion on 6 June 2007.
The Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies of Cajamurcia Vida through having the majority vote at meetings of the companys board of directors.
We have therefore consolidated its results and balance sheet since that date.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 3 Subsidiaries continued The acquisition of the initial 5% shareholding has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 2 million, calculated as follows: Purchase cost: m Cash paid 8 Attributable costs 1 Total consideration 9 The book and fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: m Assets Intangible assets 202 Other assets Total assets 202 Liabilities Deferred tax on acquired assets 60 Total liabilities 60 Total net assets 142 Net assets acquired initial 5% share 7 Goodwill arising on acquisition of this holding 2 The value of the agreement to distribute through Cajamurcias branch network has been identified as a separate intangible asset with a value of 202 million, using estimated post-tax cash flows and discount rates.
As noted above, the results of Cajamurcia Vida have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group and have contributed nil to the consolidated profit before tax since it began trading on 30 November 2007. iii Italian transactions with Banco Popolare During the year, the Groups Italian holding company has entered into three sets of transactions with an Italian bank, Banco Popolare Societa Cooperativa Banco Popolare.
Details of these transactions are as follows : a Petunia and Banca Network On 18 September 2007, the Group made a capital contribution of 19 million to Petunia SpA Petunia, an investment holding company, previously held as a financial investment.
The Groups holding in Petunia has increased to 40.62% but, as the Group has 51% of voting rights and management control, the Group has consolidated this company as a subsidiary.
The total capitalisation of the company at this date was 47 million, which was used to purchase a 49.75% 135 stake in Banca Bipielle Network SpA, an Italian distribution network, from Banco Popolare on 26 September 2007.
The Financial acquired company has since been renamed Banca Network Investimenti SpA Banca Network.
statements The Group does not have management control of Banca Network and so accounts for it as an investment in an associate.
The total consideration was 49 million, comprising cash consideration of 46 million and contingent consideration of 3 million representing the present value of future expected performance-related consideration.
The fair value of the Groups share of Banca Networks identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition was 27 million.
The residual goodwill of 22 million has been included in the carrying value of the investment in associate see note 19.
This residual goodwill has been calculated based on the provisional fair values of the net assets and liabilities of Banca Network, and may be restated in 2008, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
b Area Life On 26 September 2007, the Group acquired a 55% stake in Area Life International Assurance Limited Area Life, a life assurance company based in Ireland, selling exclusively to Italian residents, from Banco Popolare for 7 million.
This acquisition has not given rise to any goodwill on acquisition.
The relevant calculation is as follows: Purchase cost: m Cash paid 7 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Subsidiaries continued The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business on insurance contracts 20 20 Investments 284 284 Reinsurance assets 20 20 Cash and cash equivalents 12 12 Other assets 4 4 Total assets 320 20 340 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 278 14 292 Deferred tax liability 5 1 6 Payables and other financial liabilities 26 26 Other liabilities 3 3 Total liabilities 312 15 327 Total net assets 8 5 13 Net assets acquired 55% 4 3 7 Goodwill arising on acquisition The assets and liabilities above have been stated at their provisional fair values and may be amended in 2008, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
The results of Petunia, Banca Network and Area Life have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 26 September 2007, and have contributed nil to the consolidated profit before tax.
c Bancassurance agreement via Avipop Assicurazioni On 14 December 2007, the Group entered a long-term bancassurance partnership in protection and non-life insurance with Banco Popolare that will further strengthen the Groups bancassurance presence in Italy and creates a new opportunity in the fast-growing protection sector.
The Group paid 184 million to secure the long-term bancassurance agreement with Banco Popolare and to acquire 50% plus one share of Avipop Assicurazioni SpA Avipop Assicurazioni, a non-life subsidiary of the bank.
Life protection business will be written in a subsidiary of Avipop Assicurazioni, which will begin trading later in 2008, subject to regulatory approval.
The Group has the majority of the voting rights and management control of Avipop Assicurazioni and has therefore fully consolidated it as a subsidiary.
136 The acquisition of Avipop Assicurazioni has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 52 million, calculated as follows: Financial Purchase cost: statements m Cash paid 184 Attributable costs 4 Total consideration 188 The assets and liabilities of the company at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Intangible assets 386 386 Investments 9 9 Other assets 3 3 Total assets 12 386 398 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 1 1 Deferred tax liability 125 125 Other liabilities 1 1 Total liabilities 2 125 127 Total net assets 10 261 271 Net assets acquired 50% 136 Goodwill arising on acquisition 52 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 3 Subsidiaries continued The value of the agreement to distribute through Banco Popolares branch network has been identified as a separate intangible asset and has been valued by an independent third party at 386 million 100% share, using estimated post-tax cash flows and discount rates.
The intangible asset has been assessed as having an indefinite useful life, subject to annual tests for impairment.
The distribution agreement is initially for ten years, with five year automatic renewal periods.
It is expected to be renewed indefinitely, due to the unfavourable terms of the put option for failure to renew.
The residual goodwill represents the impact of recognising a deferred tax liability on the intangible asset.
The assets and liabilities as at the acquisition date in the table opposite are stated at their provisional values, and may be amended in 2008, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
The results of Avipop Assicurazioni have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 14 December 2007, and have contributed nil to the consolidated profit before tax.
iv Cyrte Investments On 27 September 2007, the Group acquired an 85% stake in Cyrte Investments BV Cyrte Investments, a Dutch fund management company, for 37 million.
The net assets of Cyrte Investments at the date of acquisition were nil, giving rise to residual goodwill of 37 million.
The residual goodwill represents the value of the companys workforce and a premium paid for the investment concepts developed in the company, based on Cyrtes expertise in the telecommunications, media and technology sectors.
No material intangible assets were identified.
The net assets as at the acquisition date are stated at their provisional values, and may be amended in 2008, in accordance with paragraph 62 of IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
The results of Cyrte Investments have been included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group with effect from 27 September 2007, and have contributed 2 million to the consolidated profit before tax.
The Group has also invested 209 million in three funds, managed by Cyrte Investments, giving it an ownership interest in the three funds of between 13% and 18%.
These funds have been accounted for as investments in associates, as Cyrte Investments is the general partner of the funds and the Groups holding gives it significant influence on the investment committee, the management board of the funds.
The Groups investment of 209 million has been included in interests in associates in note 19. v Hamilton Insurance Company Limited and Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited On 1 November 2007, the Group completed the acquisition of Hamilton Insurance Company Limited and Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited the Hamilton companies from HFC Bank Limited, a subsidiary of HSBC Finance Corporation.

The acquisition of Hamilton Insurance Company Limited has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 2 million, calculated 137 as follows: Purchase cost: Financial statements m Cash paid 55 Attributable costs 2 Total consideration 57 The book and fair values of the assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: m Assets Investments 68 Reinsurance assets 24 Cash and cash equivalents 25 Other assets 24 Total assets 141 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 67 Other liabilities 19 Total liabilities 86 Total net assets acquired 55 Goodwill arising on acquisition 2 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 3 Subsidiaries continued The acquisition of Hamilton Life Assurance Company Limited Hamilton Life has given rise to goodwill on acquisition of 21 million, calculated as follows: Purchase cost: m Cash paid 44 Attributable costs 1 Total consideration 45 The assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition were: Fair value and accounting policy Book value adjustments Fair value m m m Assets Acquired value of in-force business on investment contracts 3 3 Investments 122 122 Other assets 5 5 Total assets 127 3 130 Liabilities Gross insurance liabilities 34 34 Investment contract liabilities 68 68 Other liabilities 4 4 Total liabilities 106 106 Total net assets acquired 21 3 24 Goodwill arising on acquisition 21 Included in the consideration paid and goodwill arising on the Hamilton Life acquisition is 20 million in respect of unrecognised deferred tax assets, which the Group may be able to utilise in future years but cannot recognise now.

The relevant assets and liabilities of the DL health insurance business have been classified as held for sale, at their carrying values, in the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2007. e Other information Principal subsidiaries at 31 December 2007 are listed on pages 268 to 269.
One of the Groups wholly-owned subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd NV, is subject to the provisions of Dutch corporate law and 140 particularly the Dutch structure company regime.
Under this regime, Delta Lloyd operates under a Supervisory Board which has a duty to have regard to the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board includes two Financial Aviva Group representatives and is responsible for advising and supervising Delta Lloyds Executive Board.
The shareholder statements is one of the most important stakeholders to whom the Supervisory Board has a duty.
Dutch Law changed in October 2004 to ensure that Supervisory Board directors in Dutch companies were henceforth to be elected by a companys shareholders voting on nominations made by its Supervisory Board and the Works Council.
Under the previous system, Supervisory Board directors appointed their own successors.
In 2006, Delta Lloyd commenced proceedings against Aviva plc to try to compel the Company to adhere to the system that existed prior to the change in the law, on the basis of agreements they say were entered into in 1973 when the Group acquired Delta Lloyd.
The Company disputes these claims and does not expect the litigation, whatever its outcome, to have any adverse effect on the financial or operational performance of Delta Lloyd or the Group.
We expect a judgement from the court on this issue sometime in 2008, which either party will then have the ability to appeal.

The Group focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments 149 supporting its long-term business.
This note explains the methodology behind this.
Financial statements a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: Long-term business 2007 2006 m m Investment variances and economic assumption changes 15 401 Economic items had a neutral net impact on profit in 2007, with favourable investment variances in the Europe region largely offset by negative effects in the USA and UK.
In Europe, positive variances related mainly to realisation of capital gains on securities in the Netherlands and France.
In the USA, realised and unrealised losses on investments were driven by the widening of credit spreads on debt securities, while in the UK there was a negative investment variance on surplus assets backing annuity business due to interest rate changes.
This compares to a significantly positive net impact of economic items on profit in 2006.
In 2006 the positive investment variance was driven primarily by favourable equity market performance worldwide and increases in market interest rates in the Euro zone.
In particular, there was a significant reduction in the cost of investment guarantees in the Netherlands as market interest rates increased.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholder and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances.
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other long-term business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
Where assets are classified as fair value through profit or loss, the Group has applied the same real-world economic assumptions for fixed interest securities, equities and properties as are used under EEV principles.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return are: Expected return Expected return Expected return Fixed interest Equities Properties 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 % % % % % % United Kingdom 4.6 4.1 7.6 7.1 6.6 6.1 France 4.0 3.3 7.0 6.3 6.0 5.3 Netherlands 4.0 3.3 7.0 6.3 6.0 5.3 Where fixed interest securities are classified as available for sale, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
150 9 Longer term investment return for general insurance and health business Financial For general insurance and health business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split statements between a calculated longer term return and short-term fluctuations from this.
This note gives details of the longer term return calculation and the relevant assumptions.
a The longer term investment return, net of expenses, attributable to the general insurance and health business result was 1,029 million 2006: 1,073 million.
b The longer term investment return and short-term fluctuation are as follows: General insurance and health business 2007 2006 m m Net investment income note 4a ii 827 1,299 Internal charges included under other headings 18 77 845 1,222 Analysed between: Longer term investment return 1,029 1,073 Short-term fluctuation in investment return 184 149 845 1,222 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 9 Longer term investment return for general insurance and health business continued c The longer term investment return is calculated separately for each principal general insurance and health business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer term rate of investment return.
The longer term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
d The total assets supporting the general insurance and health business, which contribute towards the longer term return were 18,291 million 2006: 19,718 million.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer term investment return are: Longer term rates of return Longer term rates of return Equities Properties 2007 2006 2007 2006 % % % % United Kingdom 7.6 7.1 6.6 6.1 France 7.0 6.3 6.0 5.3 Ireland 7.0 6.3 6.0 5.3 Netherlands 7.0 6.3 6.0 5.3 Canada 7.1 7.0 6.1 6.0 The Group has applied the same economic assumptions for equities and properties as are used under EEV principles to calculate the longer term investment return for its general insurance and health business.

The tests led to impairment of goodwill of 10 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 16 Goodwill continued i UK general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance and health unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 10.17% 2006: 10.45%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 0% growth rate 2006: 3%.
The recoverable amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the UK general insurance industry.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims inflation and commission rates.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and has been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates.
The growth rate is considered to be consistent with both past experience and external sources of data ABI Annual Market Statistics.
ii RAC non-insurance operations The recoverable amount of the RAC non-insurance operations has also been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 9.98% 2006: 10.32%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 2% growth rate.
The recoverable amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash-generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth.
Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, fee income and customer numbers.
iii France long-term business The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed as part of the recoverable amount of the French long-term business cash generating unit and has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of the business, including indefinite life intangible assets, to the European Embedded Value EEV.
If the EEV is less than the carrying value of the business, the present value of profits from expected new business is considered.
157 The EEV of the French long term business was significantly greater than its carrying value, including indefinite life intangible assets.
A reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash Financial generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: statements Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by the Groups auditors.
iv Ireland long-term business The recoverable amount of the Irish long-term business has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of the business, including goodwill, to the European Embedded Value EEV.
If the EEV is less than the carrying value of the business the present value of profits from expected new business is considered.
The EEV of the Irish long-term business is greater than its carrying value so the recoverable value will be significantly in excess of its carrying value, including goodwill.
A reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the European Embedded Value EEV principles.
v Ireland general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the Irish general insurance and health unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 8.07% 2006: 8.07%.
Cash flows beyond that three year period have been extrapolated using a steady 4.6% growth rate 2006: 4.6%.
The recoverable amount significantly exceeds the carrying value of the cash generating unit including goodwill and a reasonably possible change in a key assumption will not cause the carrying value of the cash generating unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16 Goodwill continued Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Irish economy.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period.
Prices are assumed to remain static in the foreseeable future and volumes are assumed to increase in line with real GDP.
These are consistent with external sources of data ESRI and PwC European Economic Outlook.
vi Italy long-term, general insurance and health The majority of the goodwill and the intangible asset with an indefinite useful life allocated to the Italian business arises from the acquisitions described in note 3 a, which occurred in the second half of 2007.
Since the acquisition dates, the assets and liabilities of the acquired companies have not changed significantly, and there have been no other events that might have materially affected the recoverable amount of the unit.
vii Netherlands long-term, general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the Netherlands life and general insurance and health cash generating units have been determined on the basis of a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an appraisal value and is based on the discounted expected future cash flows from the operations over a 25-year period.
Expected cash flows for future periods have been obtained from the plan figures for a three year period.
Expected cash flows for later periods have been extrapolated, taking into account the growth rate.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Growth rate represents the rate applied to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on management's best estimate of future growth.
The rate is in line with industry expectations of 2.5%.
Risk-adjusted discount rate represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experiences in future years may differ from those assumed.
viii Spain long-term business The recoverable amount of the Spanish unit has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
This calculation is an  appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and 158 the value of the in-force business.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a firm of actuarial consultants and by the Groups auditors: Financial statements New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is based on business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements best estimate of future growth.
The rate is in line with industry expectations: and Risk adjusted discount rate represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
ix United States long-term business The recoverable amount of the United States unit has been determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation.
The underlying methodology and assumptions have been reviewed by a firm of actuarial consultants and by the Groups auditors: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.

d Impairment testing The Groups investments in RBS Life Investments Limited and RBSG Collective Investments Limited have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The calculations use cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a five 164 year period and a risk adjusted discount rate of 81%.
Cash flows beyond that five year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 4.5%.
The recoverable amounts significantly exceed the carrying values of both the investments Financial and a reasonably possible change to the key underlying assumptions will not cause the carrying values of the investments statements to exceed their recoverable amounts.

These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment, on the basis of Existing Use Value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, for all but specialised-use properties which are valued on a depreciated replacement cost DRC basis as permitted by paragraph 33 of IAS 16.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 301 million 2006: 368 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

Values are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and are based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, assuming no future growth in rental income.
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties.

The fair value has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was a loss of 210 million 2006: nil.
The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2007 was a loss of 210 million 2006: nil.
b Collateral The Group holds collateral in respect of loans where it is considered appropriate, in order to reduce the risk of nonrecovery.
This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy, for the majority of the loan balances above.
In the event of a default, the Group is able to sell or repledge the collateral.
The amount of collateral received with respect to loans which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was 6,282 million 2006: 2,129 million.
The value of collateral that was actually sold or repledged in the 167 absence of default was nil 2006: nil.
Financial statements 23 Securitised mortgages and related assets The Group has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings, in our UK Life and Dutch businesses.
This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of arrangements i United Kingdom In a long-term business subsidiary NUER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the noteholders, loan providers and other third-parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed rate, floating rate and index-linked notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although NUER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the residual or ownership risks related to them, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
NUER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where NUER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
NUER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Securitised mortgages and related assets continued ii Netherlands and Belgium In three subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd Levensverzekering NV DLL, Amstelhuys NV AMS, and Delta Lloyd Bank NV SA DLB, the principal benefits of certain portfolios of mortgage loans have been transferred to a number of special purpose securitisation companies, which were funded primarily through the issue of fixed rate, floating rate and index-linked notes.
All the shares in the securitisation companies are held by independent trustee companies.
Although DLL, AMS and DLB do not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the securitisation companies or their parent companies, they retain control of the residual or ownership risks related to them, and these companies have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
DLL, AMS and DLB have no right, nor any obligation, to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans before the optional call date, other than in certain circumstances where they are in breach of warranty.
Delta Lloyd companies have purchased notes in the securitisation companies, which have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the securitisation companies in the consolidated balance sheet.
iii General In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 24 Financial investments continued c Financial investment arrangements i Stock lending arrangements The Group has entered into stock lending arrangements in the UK and overseas during the year in accordance with established market conventions.
The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occur in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally-domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amounts of financial assets received and pledged in this manner at 31 December 2007 were 23,779 million and 4 million respectively 2006: 16,902 million and nil respectively.
The value of collateral that was actually sold or re-pledged in the absence of default was nil 2006: nil.
In addition to the above, the Group has received and pledged cash collateral under stock lending arrangement that has been recognised on the balance sheet with a corresponding obligation or receivable for its return.
These latter balances are shown separately in notes 48 and 25 respectively.
ii Stock repurchase arrangements Included within financial investments are 358 million 2006: 722 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are shown in note 48. iii Other arrangements Certain financial investments are specifically deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries.

No further credit risk provision is therefore required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.

29 Equity compensation plans This note describes the various equity compensation plans we use, and shows how we value the options and awards of shares in the Company.
a Description of the plans The Group maintains a number of active stock option and award schemes.
These are as follows: 173 i Savings-related options These are options granted under the Inland Revenue-approved Save As You Earn SAYE share option schemes in the UK Financial and in Ireland.
Options are normally exercisable during the six month period following either the third, fifth or seventh statements anniversary of the start of the relevant savings contract.
ii Executive share options These are options granted on various dates from 1998 to 2004, under the Aviva Executive Share Option Scheme or predecessor schemes.
Options granted between 1998 and 2000 were subject to the satisfaction of conditions relating to either the Companys return on equity shareholders funds ROE or its relative total shareholder return TSR against a chosen comparator group.
In respect of options granted from 2000 the performance condition has been a mixture of both ROE and TSR measures.
In all cases, performance is measured over a three year performance period and the options are normally exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of their grant.
iii Deferred bonus plan options These are options granted in 1999 and 2000 under the CGU Deferred Bonus Plan.
Participants who deferred their annual cash bonus in exchange for an award of shares of equal value also received a matching award over an equal number of share options.
The exercise of these options is not subject to the attainment of performance conditions.
These options are exercisable up to the tenth anniversary of their grant.
iv Long-term incentive plan awards These awards have been made to senior Group executives since 2001 and are described in section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.
v Deferred bonus plan awards These awards have been made under the Aviva Deferred Bonus Plan, and are described in section b below and in the Directors remuneration report.
The Group has established various employee share trusts to facilitate the delivery of shares under the above schemes.

Shares which do not vest, lapse.
iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the various executive incentive plans and funded by the Company.
Since March 2003, it has generally been the Companys practice to satisfy the awards granted after that date by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting, and no shares were purchased by the trusts.
However, during 2007, shares have been purchased by the trustee to allow awards to be satsified from trust where necessary to comply with local regulations.
Further details are given in note 30. c Movements in the year A summary of the status of the option plans as at 31 December 2007 and 2006, and changes during the years ended on those dates, is shown below.

The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
1,496,069 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2006: nil.

Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the Netherlands, the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders and after tax, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benefits that are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In the United States, there are two main business segments protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as nonparticipating investment contracts.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
181 Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
Financial statements iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Insurance liabilities continued a UK With-profit business the valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, the retrospective approach is not available or is inappropriate, so a prospective valuation approach is used instead, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Smoothing which can be negative : Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and Expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profit sub-funds in NUL&P, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
Where policyholders have valuable guarantees, options or promises, then future persistency is assumed to improve, and future take-up rates of guaranteed annuity options are assumed to increase.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on gilts, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary, according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2007 being 4.72% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instrument, where available.
Specimen values based on the average term of the liabilities are as follows: Volatility 2007 2006 Equities 25% NUL&P 23.5% other WP funds 17% for UK stocks 182 Property 15% 15% Financial Gilts 3.75% 3.25% NUL&P 4.5% other WP funds statements Corporate bonds 5.75% 5.25% NUL&P 6.5% other WP funds Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2008 have been set consistently with the year end 2007 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions are set with regard to recent company experience and general industry trends.
Most assumptions are unchanged from 2006 but for some endowment and whole life business the basis has been strengthened although the base mortality tables are unchanged.
Mortality table used 2007 2006 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred Nil or AM92 AF92 Nil or AM92 AF92 annuities before vesting Pensions business after vesting and pensions PCMA00 PCFA00 PCMA00 PCFA00 annuities in payment adjusted plus allowance adjusted plus allowance for future mortality for future mortality improvement improvement Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 38 Insurance liabilities continued For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of longterm interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
At the end of 2006 changes were made to the assumptions for certain non-profit business, resulting from a decision taken by management to adopt changes permitted by the FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers, issued in December 2006.
In 2007 these changes were applied to healthcare business in addition to the business affected at the end of 2006.
Valuation discount rates are largely unchanged since 2006, reflecting the yields on the supporting assets.

Since 2006, the assurance mortality basis has been reviewed with the aim of harmonising assumptions wherever possible across similar lines of business in order to simplify the basis.
The base mortality tables used in the valuation remain unchanged however, as summarised below: Mortality tables used 183 2007 2006 Financial Assurances statements Non-profit AM80 AF80 or AM92 AF92 AM80 AF80 or AM92 AF92 or TM92 TF92 or TM92 TF92 adjusted for smoker status adjusted for smoker status and age sex specific factors and age sex specific factors Pure endowments and Nil or AM80 AF80 or Nil or AM80 AF80 or deferred annuities before vesting AM92 AF92 adjusted AM92 AF92 adjusted General annuity business after vesting ML00 IFL00 adjusted IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus allowance for future plus allowance for future mortality improvement mortality improvement Pensions business after vesting PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future plus allowance for future mortality improvement mortality improvement Annuities in payment General annuity business ML00 IFL00 adjusted IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus allowance for future plus allowance for future mortality improvement mortality improvement Pensions business PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted or IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus or IML00 IFL00 adjusted plus allowance for future allowance for future mortality improvement mortality improvement Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Insurance liabilities continued b France The majority of provisions arise from a single premium savings product and are based on the accumulated fund value, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2007 and 2006 2007 and 2006 Life assurances 1.75% to 4.5% PM60-64, TD73-77, TD88 90, TF00-02, TH00-02 Annuities 1.75% to 4.5% TPRV prospective table, TGF05, TGH05 c Netherlands On transition to IFRS, the valuation of most long-term insurance and participating investment contracts was changed from existing methods that generally used historic assumptions to an active basis using current market interest rates.
A liability adequacy test is performed in line with IFRS requirements.
Where liabilities are based on current market interest rates and assets are valued at market value, the margin in the liability adequacy test is determined by comparison of the liabilities with the present value of best estimate cash flows.

184 The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on Financial guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
Reserve interest assumptions ranged statements from 2.00% to 7.50% in 2007 2006: 2.00% to 7.50%.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2007 was 4.46% 2006: 4.48%.
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, indexed life, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
The weighted average interest crediting rates for universal life products were 5.45% in 2007 2006: 4.37%.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 2.50% to 7.00% in 2007 2006: 2.75% to 7.00%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally-weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the call options and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in equity so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in equity affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 38 Insurance liabilities continued e Other countries In all other countries, local generally-accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 2007 2006 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 126,614 114,430 Provisions in respect of new business 10,470 8,750 Expected change in existing business provisions 6,280 5,678 Variance between actual and expected experience 877 1,209 Effect of adjusting to PS06 14 realistic basis 60 800 Impact of other operating assumption changes 95 333 Impact of economic assumption changes 909 1,727 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders note 59 1,728 Other movements 324 314 Change in liability recognised as an expense 3,843 1,735 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 571 12,454 Foreign exchange rate movements 4,284 2,005 Carrying amount at 31 December 135,312 126,614 c General insurance and health liabilities Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the balance sheet date.
The reserves for general insurance and health are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
Outstanding claims provisions are based on undiscounted estimates of future claim payments, except for the following classes of business for which discounted provisions are held: Rate Mean term of liabilities Country Class 2007 2006 2007 2006 185 Netherlands Permanent health and injury 3.87% 3.61% 8 years 9 years Financial UK Reinsured London Market business 5.00% 5.00% 8 years 8 years statements The gross outstanding claims provisions before discounting were 13,439 million 2006: 12,768 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians, applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 38 Insurance liabilities continued In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims inflation or loss ratios.
Instead, the assumptions used are those implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at the estimated ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from the range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
Movements The following changes have occurred in the general insurance and health claims provisions during the year: 2007 2006 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 12,718 12,965 Impact of changes in assumptions 1 2 Claim losses and expenses incurred in the current year 8,273 7,639 Decrease in estimated claim losses and expenses incurred in prior years 937 550 Incurred claims losses and expenses 7,337 7,091 Less: Payments made on claims incurred in the current year 4,408 3,765 Payments made on claims incurred in prior years 3,686 3,771 Recoveries on claim payments 315 304 Claims payments made in the year, net of recoveries 7,779 7,232 Other movements in the claims provisions 36 7 Changes in claims reserve recognised as an expense 406 148 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 175 207 Foreign exchange rate movements 655 306 Carrying amount at 31 December 13,142 12,718 The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in note 42. d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2001 to 2007.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2007 5,618 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated 186 ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was re-estimated to be 6,122 million at 31 December 2007.
This decrease from the original estimate is due to the combination of a number of factors.
The original estimates will be increased or Financial statements decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
In 2005, the year of adoption of IFRS, only five years were required to be disclosed.
This is being increased in each succeeding additional year, until ten years of information is included.
The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its non-life and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will then result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables.
However, in order to maintain reserve adequacy, the Group transfers releases to current accident year 2007 reserves where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
The release from prior accident year reserves during 2007 is also due to an improvement in the estimated ultimate cost of claims.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
188 The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2001.
The claim provisions, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2007 Financial were 323 million 2006: 312 million.
The movement in the year reflects strengthening of provisions by 20 million statements 2006: 9 million, foreign exchange rate movements and timing differences between claim payments and reinsurance recoveries.
e Provision for unearned premiums Movements The following changes have occurred in the provision for unearned premiums UPR during the year: 2007 2006 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,182 5,381 Premiums written during the year 11,369 11,427 Less: Premiums earned during the year 11,345 11,516 Changes in UPR recognised as expense income 24 89 Gross portfolio transfers and acquisitions 87 3 Foreign exchange rate movements 191 113 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,484 5,182 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 39 Liability for investment contracts This note analyses our investment contract liabilities by type of product and describes how we calculate these liabilities and what assumptions we have used.
a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2007 2006 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 53,609 49,400 Non-participating contracts at fair value 43,608 38,081 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 1,027 877 44,635 38,958 Total 98,244 88,358 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 38.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 40.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Most non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value are unit-linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
For this business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 26 and the 189 deferred income liability is shown in note 49.
In the United States, funding agreements consist of one to ten year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be Financial cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may be terminated by Aviva at any time.
statements The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements in 2007 were 5.21% and 5.15% 2006: 5.07% and 5.55% respectively.
The funding agreements are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.

statements The effect of changes in main assumptions is given in note 42.
40 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 38 and 39. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 40 Financial guarantees and options continued The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, while these do not constitute guarantees, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Subject to certain conditions, top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14 Prudential Changes for Insurers, as outlined in note 38b iii a. i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 36 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 39 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
191 c Overseas life businesses Financial In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts statements containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2007.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 24 billion at 31 December 2007 2006: 21 billion.
The guaranteed bonus on this contract equals 75% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates and was 3.64% for 2007 2006: 3.30% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 4.92% 2006: 4.81%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 8 billion 2006: 6 billion at 31 December 2007 and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
For non-AFER business, the accounting income return exceeded guaranteed bonus rates in 2007.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Financial guarantees and options continued Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at the end of 2007 for this guarantee is 30 million 2006: 8 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2007, total sums at risk for these contracts were 63 million 2006: 38 million out of total unitlinked funds of 15 billion 2006: 13 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 53.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 17 million 2006: 3 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 7 million 2006: 2 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2007 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Netherlands Guaranteed minimum return at maturity In the Netherlands, it is market practice to guarantee a minimum return at maturity on traditional savings and pension contracts.
Guarantees on older lines of business are 4% per annum while, for business written since 1 September 1999, the guarantee is 3% per annum.
On Group pensions business, it is often possible to recapture guarantee costs through adjustments to surrender values or to premium rates.
On transition to IFRS, Delta Lloyd changed the reserving basis for most traditional contracts to reflect current market interest rates, for consistency with the reporting of assets at market value.
The cost of meeting interest rate guarantees is allowed for directly in the liabilities.
Although most traditional contracts are valued at market interest rate, the split by level of guarantee shown below is according to the original underlying guarantee.
The total liabilities for traditional business at 31 December 2007 are 10 billion 2006: 8 billion analysed as follows: Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities Liabilities 3% guarantee 3% guarantee 4% guarantee 4% guarantee 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Individual 1,387 1,222 3,671 2,989 Group pensions 485 518 3,993 3,180 Total 1,872 1,740 7,664 6,169 Delta Lloyd has certain unit-linked contracts which provide a guaranteed minimum return at maturity from 4% pa to 2% pa.
Provisions consist of unit values plus an additional reserve for the guarantee.
The additional provision for the guarantee was 70 million 2006: 76 million.
An additional provision of 19 million 2006: 43 million in respect of investment return guarantees on group segregated fund business is held.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 211 million 2006: 163 million if yields were to reduce by 1% pa and by 21 million 2006: 25 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2007 levels.
192 iii Ireland Financial Guaranteed annuity options statements Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 160 million 2006: 152 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently out-of-the-money by 53 million 2006: 69 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
It is estimated that the guarantees would be out-of-the-money by 46 million 2006: 74 million if yields were to increase by 1% per annum and by 29 million 2006: 31 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2007 levels.
Return of premium guarantee Hibernian Life has written two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee after five or six years.
The provision for these at the end of 2007 is 0.1 million 2006: nil.
It is estimated that the provision would not increase if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2007 levels by 1.4 million.
It is estimated that the provision would increase if interest rates were to increase by 1% from year end 2007 levels by 0.1 million.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 40 Financial guarantees and options continued iv Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2007, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 4 billion 2006: 3 billion with a further reserve of 16 million 2006: 18 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 4 billion 2006: 5 billion, with a further provision of 48 million 2006: 46 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 66 million 2006: 66 million in Spain and 14 million 2006: 9 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2007 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.42% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
v United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase call options to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The call options held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2007, the total liabilities for indexed products were 8.4 billion 2006: 5.4 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 89 million 2006: 51 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 86 million 2006: 56 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2007, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 1.2 billion 2006: 1.4 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2007, a total of 0.7 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the 193 guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.

This results from the use of higher valuation interest rates for the UK annuities and Dutch traditional business, reflecting the rise in market interest rates over the year.
The mortality impacts relate to assumption changes in the UK.
The impact on existing business of applying FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers, in 2007 is 60 million, relating to UK income protection business.
This is reflected in reductions in insurance contract liabilities of 60 million see note 38 b.
The impact on new business in 2007 is 4 million, giving a total increase in pre-tax profit for the year of 64 million.

46 Pension obligations 197 This note describes the Groups pension arrangements for its employees and explains how our obligations to these Financial schemes are calculated.
statements a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
An actuarial report has been submitted for each of the defined benefit schemes within the last three years, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 46 Pension obligations continued b Membership The number of scheme members at 31 December 2007 was as follows: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland Number Number Number Number Active members 10,532 5,048 4,192 821 Deferred pensioners 53,953 5,015 620 830 Pensioners 27,176 2,815 2,597 674 Total members 91,661 12,878 7,409 2,325 c Main UK scheme In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed to new employees.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
i Defined benefit section of the ASPS The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed.
At 31 March 2006, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, of 1,019 million 31 March 2005: excess obligations of 888 million.
The Company has agreed with the trustees a funding plan through to March 2014, over which it will aim to eliminate the funding deficit.
Funding levels are monitored on an annual basis.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS throughout 2007 were 37% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year, and additional deficit funding payments totalling 83 million.
As this section of the scheme is closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the projected unit credit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benefits will continue to increase as the membership ages, leading to higher pension costs, and the number of members falls, leading to a higher charge per member.
The employers contribution rate for 2008 has therefore been increased to 39% of pensionable salaries expected to be 114 million, pending finalisation of the April 2007 valuation.
The Group is also expecting to make further contributions of 320 million into the ASPS prior to March 2008 and 49 million later in the year.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contribute 5% of their pensionable salaries.
For funding purposes, the schemes valuation as at 1 April 2007 is currently being completed, with the obligations calculated using the Projected Unit Method which is described below.
In 2006, the Groups UK life business carried out an investigation into the allocation of costs in respect of funding the ASPS, to identify the deficit that arose in respect of accruals prior to the introduction of the current management services agreements MSAs and to propose a split between individual product companies based on an allocation of the deficit into 198 preand post-MSA amounts.
The results of this review were updated during 2006 and agreed by the relevant company boards and accepted by the UK regulator.
Consequently, with effect from 1 January 2006, the Companys UK with-profit Financial product companies are liable for a share, currently 12%, of the additional payments for deficit funding referred to above.
statements This resulted in a transfer of 130 million from the unallocated divisible surplus UDS to the income statement in 2006, to reflect the position at the start of that year, and a movement of 61 million in 2007 2006: 30 million back to the UDS via the statement of recognised income and expense to reflect actuarial movements in the deficit during the year and therefore a change in the amount recoverable from the with-profit product companies.
ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
The employers contribution rates for members of the defined contribution section throughout 2007 were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions up to 4% where members contribute, and the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2008.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 46 Pension obligations continued d Charges to the income statement The total pension costs of the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2007 2006 m m UK defined benefit schemes 137 150 UK defined contribution schemes 44 51 Overseas defined benefit schemes 54 63 Overseas defined contribution schemes 19 20 254 284 There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2007 or 2006. e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Including the deficit funding in the UK schemes discussed above, total employer contributions for these schemes in 2008 are expected to be 568 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of buy out benefits at a particular date.
A buy-out valuation will almost always be the highest estimate of the pension deficit, as it assumes that the entire liability will be settled in one payment, with all obligations transferred to an insurance company.
However, there are only a limited number of organisations that would be able to buy out the pension liabilities in schemes of the size and geographical spread of those in our Group, and they would naturally seek to make a profit on the transaction.
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year end liabilities of 7.2 billion could be valued some 3.7 billion higher, at 10.9 billion.
199 IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the Financial alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension statements schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2007.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country who, other than the actuary of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme and Dutch arrangements, were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2007.
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 2007 2006 Inflation rate 3.4% 3.1% 2.0% 1.9% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.25% General salary increases 5.2% 4.9% 3.0% 2.4% 3.75% 3.75% 4.25% 4.0% Pension increases 3.4% 3.1% 2.0 2.4% 1.9% 1.25% 1.25% 2.4% 2.15% Deferred pension increases 3.4% 3.1% 2.0 2.4% 1.9% 2.4% 2.15% Discount rate 5.8% 5.1% 5.5% 4.6% 5.25% 5.0% 5.6% 4.7% Basis of discount rate AA-rated AA-rated Eurozone AA-rated AA-rated Eurozone corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds corporate bonds Age-related scale increases plus 3% 2006: 2.4%.
The discount rate and inflation rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.5 billion.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 46 Pension obligations continued Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2007 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK PA92U08MC with a one year age rating deduction and an allowance for 87.8 88.9 90.7 91.7 or future improvements 60 27.8 28.9 30.7 31.7 Netherlands Coll 2003 Group Annuity Mortality with different age corrections and an 82.8 82.8 87.1 87.1 allowance for future improvements 65 17.8 17.8 22.1 22.1 Canada UP1994 projected to 2005, using Scale AA 83.2 83.2 86.2 86.2 65 18.2 18.2 21.2 21.2 Ireland PA92C2020 current pensioners 2040 84.4 85.7 87.4 88.7 future pensioners 60 24.4 25.7 27.4 28.7 The assumptions above are based on commonly-used mortality tables.
In the UK, the standard mortality tables have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are by far the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions medium cohort projection table.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the above schemes liabilities by 199 million.
The scheme liabilities have an average duration of 22 years in the UK schemes and between 14 and 28 years in the overseas schemes.
ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 2008 2007 200 Equities 7.6% 8.0% 7.2% 6.5% 7.0% 7.8% 7.4% 7.5% Bonds 5.3% 4.75% 4.6% 4.0% 4.5% 4.5% 4.5% 4.1% Financial Property 6.6% 6.0% 5.8% 6.2% n a n a 6.4% 5.5% statements Other 5.8% 5.3% 4.6% 4.0% n a n a 2.3% n a The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns are developed in conjunction with external advisers and take into account both current market expectations of future returns, where available, and historical returns.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses.
iii Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies Plan assets in the UK and Dutch schemes include investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies with other Group companies.
Their treatment in the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows : Plan assets The treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated balance sheet is described in section vii below.
Expected rates of return Where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section ii above.

v Experience gains and losses The following disclosures of experience gains and losses will be built up over time to give a five year history.
Scheme assets exclude insurance policies with Group companies and income on the assets underlying them.

To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, whilst the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: Equity market risk the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets.
Inflation risk the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities.
Interest rate risk falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets.
During 2007, there has been a reduction in the proportion of assets invested in equities, thereby mitigating the equity risk.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.
Plan assets in the table above include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated balance sheet of 150 million 2006: 336 million in the UK scheme, and insurance policies of 143 million and 1,025 million 2006: 152 million and 934 million in the UK and Dutch schemes respectively.
Where the investment and insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, they are included in the appropriate line in the table above, otherwise they appear in Other.
Since 1 January 2007, the UK insurance policies have been considered transferable under the terms of IAS 19.
However, the Dutch insurance policies are considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so have been treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 45.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 46 Pension obligations continued The total IAS 19 obligations and strict IAS 19 assets ie excluding the non-transferable insurance policies of the schemes give a net deficit of 1,203 million 2006: 2,059 million, as shown in the following table.

47 Borrowings Our borrowings are either core structural borrowings, such as subordinated debt, debenture loans and most commercial paper, or operational borrowings, such as bank loans and financing for securitised mortgage loan notes.
This note shows the carrying values and contractual maturity amounts of each type, and explains their main features and movements during the year.

These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 47 Borrowings continued d Description and features i Subordinated debt A description of each of the subordinated notes is set out in the table below: In the event the Company does not call the notes, Callable at par at the coupon will reset at Notional amount Issue date Redemption date option of the Company from each applicable reset date to 700 million 14 November 2001 14 November 2036 16 November 2026 5 year Benchmark Gilt 2.85% 1800 million 14 November 2001 14 November 2021 14 November 2011 3 month Euribor 2.12% 1650 million 29 September 2003 2 October 2023 2 October 2013 3 month Euribor 2.08% 1500 million 29 September 2003 Undated 29 September 2015 3 month Euribor 2.35% 800 million 29 September 2003 Undated 29 September 2022 5 year Benchmark Gilt 2.40% US$300 million 19 December 2006 19 June 2017 19 June 2012 3 month US LIBOR 0.84% The subordinated notes were issued by the Company.
They rank below its senior obligations and ahead of its preference shares and ordinary share capital.
The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2007 was 3,006 million 2006: 3,076 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by a Dutch subsidiary to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV in 1999.
They are convertible into ordinary shares in Delta Lloyd NV, should there be a public offering of those shares.
These loan notes have a face value of 1489.9 million but, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is 1172.4 million, calculated in 1999 and based on the future cash flows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest.
The rate of interest paid on the notes is being gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009.
The 5.95% Senior Notes had been issued by a United States subsidiary prior to acquisition by the Group.
On 23 February 2007, the subsidiary exercised its option to redeem the notes early for an amount not significantly different to their carrying value.
As a result, these notes have been shown in table b for 2006 as maturing within one year.
Other loans comprise borrowings in the United States.
Fixed rate borrowings comprise 335 million 2006: 521 million of the total carrying value of 335 million 2006: 521 million.
The fair value of debenture loans at 31 December 2007 was 395 million 2006: 580 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices or discounted future cash flows as appropriate.
207 iii Commercial paper Financial The commercial paper consists of 918 million in the Company 2006: 733 million and 4 million in France statements 2006: 4 million.
All of this is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

The PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios, and the lenders are only entitled to obtain payment of both interest and principal to the extent there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
Loans of 485 million 2006: 123 million included in the table relate to those PLPs which have been consolidated as subsidiaries.
b Certain Irish policyholder investment funds and unit trusts, which have been fully consolidated in accordance with accounting policy C, have raised borrowings with external credit institutions.
The borrowings are secured on the funds, with the only recourse on default being the underlying investments in these funds and unit trusts.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
These loans run for a period of five years, with interest rates fixed monthly and based on a fixed margin above the Euro inter-bank rate.
The amount of these loans can be varied without any penalty being charged, subject to a maximum of 50% Loan to Value and a maximum facility of 1378 million.
c In September 2004, one of the Groups UK long-term business subsidiaries, Norwich Union Life & Pensions Limited NULAP, entered into a securitisation arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc RBSG, to provide funding to cover initial new business acquisition and administration costs.
Under the arrangement, an RBSG company provided a loan facility of 200 million to NULAP in respect of selected term assurance policies, secured on future premiums and repayment of commissions due from brokers where a policy has lapsed.
The funding was repayable over four years from the date of advance, and interest was charged at a floating rate.
RBSG had no recourse to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any companies in the Aviva Group.
On 12 January 2007, under a Deed of Release and Termination, this arrangement was cancelled.
d One of the Groups UK long-term business subsidiaries, Norwich Union Equity Release Limited NUER, has transferred the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages to various UK building societies, retaining a proportion of the interest earned.
The transfers qualify for partial derecognition and, as such, the interest receivable on the mortgages is recognised as an asset within non-securitised mortgage loans, carried at fair value, with a corresponding liability recognising the fair value of future interest payable to the building societies.
This liability has previously been recognised within borrowings.
As this liability does not represent actual operational borrowings, but a liability to pay a proportion of future interest receivable on the mortgages to the building societies, the liability has been reclassified to other liabilities.
The fair value of these loans is considered to be the same as their carrying value.
v Securitised mortgage loan notes Loan notes have been issued by special purpose securitisation companies in the UK and the Netherlands.
Details of these securitisations are given in note 23.
For the Dutch securitised mortgage loan notes carried at amortised cost of 2,283 million 2006: 2,038 million, their fair value is 2,283 million 2006: 2,006 million, calculated based on the future cash flows discounted back at the market rate of interest.

These loan notes have external credit ratings which have not changed since the inception of the loans.

a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 38 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of future policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including the UK, Australia and Canada.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
210 However, the Groups net exposure to such liabilities is not significant and, on the basis of current information and having Financial regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any costs arising are not statements likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Note 40 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on guaranteed annuity options GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 23 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 31 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the very few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 50 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specific letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 96 million at 31 December 2007 2006: 128 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA rules.
The Group now includes details of its endowment policyholders time bar position within the annual re-projection mailings.
Customers will be given at least 12 months individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable double the six months notice required by the FSA.
f Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
The FSA regulates the Groups UK business and in addition monitors the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole.
The FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation, to investigate marketing and sales practices and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers but in some cases they operate a system of prior product approval and hence place less emphasis than the FSA on regulating sales and marketing practices.
The directors believe each of the Groups regulated businesses dedicates appropriate resources to its compliance programme, endeavours to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and takes corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the dayto-day management of the business.
g Aviva USA litigation 211 In November 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of the AmerUs Group, a US-based insurer.
In common with other companies operating in the sector, AmerUs is subject to litigation, including class-action litigation, arising out of its Financial sale of equity-based index-linked annuity products.
The Group is aware of a multi-district class action filed against AmerUs statements in Pennsylvania but is not aware of any adverse development.
The directors continue to monitor the situation and consider that the litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups ability to meet shareholder expectations.
h Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
At 31 December 2007, the total exposure of the Group and Company is 7 million 2006: 7 million and 113 million 2006: 109 million respectively but, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have been given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.

53 Group capital structure The Group maintains an efficient capital structure from a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings, consistent with our overall risk profile and the regulatory and market requirements of our business.
This note describes the way we manage our capital and shows where this is employed.
a Capital management objectives 214 Avivas capital management philosophy is focused on capital efficiency and effective risk management to support a Financial progressive dividend policy and EPS growth.
Rigorous capital allocation is one of the Groups primary strategic priorities and statements is ultimately overseen by the Group Executive Committee.
The Groups overall capital risk appetite is set and managed with reference to the requirements of a range of different stakeholders including shareholders, policyholders, regulators and rating agencies.
In managing capital we seek to: maintain sufficient, but not excessive, financial strength to support new business growth and satisfy the requirements of our stakeholders optimise our overall debt to equity structure to enhance our returns to shareholders, subject to our capital risk appetite and balancing the requirements of the range of stakeholders retain financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity, including significant unutilised committed credit lines and access to a range of capital markets allocate capital rigorously across the Group, to drive value adding growth in accordance with risk appetite.
increase the dividend on a basis judged prudent, while retaining capital to support future business growth, using dividend cover on an IFRS operating earnings after tax basis in the 1.5 to 2.0 times range as a guide.
Further detail over the management and allocation of capital resources is set out in the following sections and in note 55 on risk management.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 53 Group capital structure continued b Capital resources The primary sources of capital used by the Group are equity shareholders funds, preference shares, subordinated debt and borrowings.
We also consider and, where efficient to do so, utilise alternative sources of capital such as reinsurance and securitisation in addition to the more traditional sources of funding.
Targets are established in relation to regulatory solvency, ratings, liquidity and dividend capacity and are a key tool in managing capital in accordance with our risk appetite and the requirements of our various stakeholders.
Overall, the Group has significant resources and financial strength.
The ratings of the Groups main operating subsidiaries are AA AAvery strong with a stable outlook from Standard & Poors, Aa3 excellent with a stable outlook from Moodys and A Superior with a stable outlook from AM Best.
These ratings reflect the Groups strong liquidity, competitive position, capital base, increasing underlying earnings and strategic and operational management.
The Group is subject to a number of regulatory capital tests and also employs economic capital measures to manage capital and risk.
c Capital allocation Capital allocation is undertaken based on a rigorous analysis of a range of financial, strategic, risk and capital factors to ensure that capital is allocated efficiently to value adding business opportunities.
A clear management decision making framework, incorporating ongoing operational and strategic performance review, periodic longer term strategic and financial planning and robust due diligence over capital allocation is in place, including formal oversight from the Group Executive Committee and Group Capital Management Committee.
These processes incorporate various capital profitability metrics, including an assessment of return on capital employed and internal rates of return in relation to hurdle rates to ensure capital is allocated efficiently and that excess business unit capital is repatriated where appropriate.
d Different measures of capital In recognition of the requirements of different stakeholders, the Group measures its capital on a number of different bases, all of which are taken into account when managing and allocating capital across the Group.
These include measures which comply with the regulatory regimes within which the Group operates and those which the directors consider appropriate for the management of the business.
The primary measures which the Group uses are:- i Accounting bases The Group reports its results on both an IFRS and a European Embedded Value basis.
The directors consider that the European Embedded Value principles provide a more meaningful measure of the long term underlying value of the capital employed in the Groups life and related businesses.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the life business is priced and managed.
Accordingly, in addition to IFRS, we analyse and measure the net asset value and total capital employed for the Group on this basis.
This is the basis on which Group Return on Equity is measured and against which the corresponding Group target is expressed.
ii Regulatory bases Individual regulated subsidiaries measure and report solvency based on applicable local regulations, including in the UK the regulations established by the Financial Services Authority FSA.
These measures are also consolidated under the European 215 Insurance Groups Directive IGD to calculate regulatory capital adequacy at an aggregate Group level.
The Group fully complied with these regulatory requirements during the year.
Financial statements iii Rating agency bases The Groups ratings are an important indicator of financial strength and maintenance of these ratings is one of the key drivers of capital risk appetite.
Certain rating agencies have proprietary capital models which they use to assess available capital resources against capital requirements, as a component of their overall criteria for assigning ratings.
In addition, rating agency measures and targets in respect of gearing and fixed charge cover are also important in evaluating the level of borrowings utilised by the Group.
While not mandatory external requirements, in practice rating agency capital measures tend to act as one of the primary drivers of capital requirements, reflecting the capital strength required in relation to our target ratings.
iv Economic bases The Group also measures its capital using an economic capital model that takes into account a more realistic set of financial and non-financial assumptions.
This model has been developed considerably over the past few years and is increasingly relevant in the internal management and external assessment of the Groups capital resources.
The economic capital model is used to assess the Groups capital strength in accordance with the Individual Capital Assessment ICA requirements established by the FSA.
Further developments are planned to meet the emerging requirements of the Solvency II framework and other external agencies.
Further details regarding the use of economic capital in risk management are set out in note 55 on Risk Management.
e Group capital structure The table below sets out the capital that is managed by the Group on an IFRS and EEV basis which, as described above, is considered as a more meaningful measure of the value of capital employed in the life and related businesses.
Internally generated AVIF represents the additional value of in-force long term business recognised under the EEV basis.
Further detail on the EEV basis is set out in the Alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section starting on page 247.

In 2007, the total capital employed increased by 3.5 billion reflecting strong operational performance and foreign exchange impacts.
i Corporate net liabilities represent the element of the pension scheme deficit held centrally.
ii In addition to our external funding sources, we have certain internal borrowing arrangements in place which allow some of the assets that support technical liabilities to be invested in a pool of central assets for use across the Group.
These internal debt balances allow for the capital allocated to business operations to exceed the externally sources capital resources of the Group.
Although intra-group in nature, they are included as part of the capital base for the purpose of capital management.
These arrangements arise in relation to the following: Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy standalone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities, these loans satisfy arms length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.
216 Aviva International Insurance AII Ltd acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for the Financial Groups foreign subsidiaries.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocate a portion of the total capital of statements the company to the UK general insurance operations.
These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets backing technical liabilities to be made available for use across the Group.
Balances in respect of these arrangements are also treated as internal debt for capital management purposes.
Net internal debt represents the balance of the above amounts due from corporate and holding entities, less the tangible net assets held by these entities.
Further disclosures on the Groups regulatory capital position are also set out in the capital section of the business review and in note 54, Capital Statement.
The purpose of note 54, which is prepared in accordance with FRS27, is to set out the financial strength of the Group and provide an analysis of the disposition and constraints over the availability of capital to meet risks and regulatory requirements.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 54 Capital statement FRS 27 requires us to produce a capital statement which sets out the financial strength of our Group entities and provides an analysis of the disposition and constraints over the availability of capital to meet risks and regulatory requirements.
The capital statement also provides a reconciliation of shareholders funds to regulatory capital.
The analysis below sets out the Groups available capital resources.
Other sources of capital include Subordinated debt of 3,054 million issued by Aviva and 176 million of other qualifying capital issued by Dutch, Italian, Spanish and US subsidiary undertakings.
Including an adjustment for minorities.
Includes the Provident Mutual with-profit fund.
Other operations include general insurance and fund management business.
Goodwill and other intangibles includes goodwill of 535 million and JVs and associates 6.
On 5 February 2008 Norwich Union Life announced a one-off special bonus worth an estimated 2.3 billion.
In accordance with FRS 27, a transfer of 2.1 billion has been made from the unallocated divisible surplus to increase insurance and participating investment contract liabilities.
0.2 billion of shareholders share of the special bonus is included within the shareholders share of the accrued bonus line.

The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of the changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
For the UK with-profit funds, the decrease in available capital is driven by a special bonus of 2.3 billion announced on 5 February 2008, which is treated as a transfer from unallocated divisible surplus to policy liabilities.
This is shown in the changes in management policy line.
Equity performance was moderate, which had a direct effect on the equity content of the estate assets.
In addition, the implied market volatility for equities has increased, which raises the assumed asset share 218 volatility and consequently guarantee costs have increased.
The positive other movements relate mainly to methodology Financial and modelling changes.
statements The changes in management policy shown in CGNU and CULAC with-profit funds relate to the special bonus announced on 5 February 2008.
For the Overseas life operations, the negative variance between actual and expected experience is driven mainly by the increase in market interest rates, which has led to capital depreciation of fixed interest assets and consequential reduction of the unallocated divisible surplus in France and other European businesses.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 16.8 billion 2006: 19.5 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year end transfer to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds available capital of 4.5 billion 2006: 6.9 billion can only be used to provide support for UK with-profits business and is not available to cover other shareholder risks.
This is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin and, therefore, the shareholders are not required to provide further capital support to this business.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 12.3 billion 2006: 12.6 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
As the total available capital of 16.8 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 54 Capital statement continued Within the Aviva group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva plc to the NUL&P non-profit fund to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual withprofit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.
The table below provides the information on the UK with-profits funds on a realistic basis.

Estimated realistic inherited estate at 31 December 2006 was 2.5 billion, 2.5 billion and 1.8 billion for CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P respectively.
The risk capital margin RCM is 3.5 times covered by the inherited estate 31 December 2006: 4.2 times.
The NUL&P fund includes the Provident Mutual PM fund, which has realistic assets and liabilities of 2.1 billion and therefore does not impact the realistic inherited estate.
219 Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK with-profit funds is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU Directive regulatory peak and the FSA realistic basis realistic peak described Financial above.
statements For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas business in the EEA, US, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum capital requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
All businesses hold sufficient available capital to meet their minimum capital requirement.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: i UK with-profit funds CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P any available surplus held in each fund can only be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself or be distributed to policyholders and shareholders.
With-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund in the case of CGNU Life, CULAC and NUL&P.
ii UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital within the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 54 Capital statement continued iii Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
iv General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
55 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses face and describes our approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in our earnings and capital requirements.. a Risk management framework The Group has established a risk management framework whose primary objective is to protect the Group from events that hinder the sustainable achievement of the Groups performance objectives, including failing to exploit opportunities.
Risk is categorised as follows: Market Credit Insurance Operational Liquidity The Group recognises the critical importance of having efficient and effective risk management systems in place.
To this end, the Group has an established governance framework, which has four key elements: Defined terms of reference for the Board, its committees, and the associated executive management committees: A clear organisational structure with documented delegated authorities and responsibilities from the Board to Board committees, executive management committees and senior management: A Group policy framework that sets out risk appetite, risk management, control and business conduct standards for 220 the Groups worldwide operations.
Each policy has a member of senior management who is charged with overseeing compliance with the policy throughout the Group, and sets out the risks being managed, our risk appetite, and the Financial control standards that we would expect a business to implement: and statements A risk management function operating throughout the group, from Group Centre, to regional support office, to business units, with clear responsibilities and objectives.
The adoption of these Group policies enables a consistent approach to management of risk at business unit level.
The Group operates a number of oversight committees that monitor aggregate risk data and take overall risk management decisions.
The Group also monitors a set of specific risks on a regular basis through the Group risk monitoring framework.
Business units are required to disclose to the Group risk function all material risks, along with information on likelihood and severity of risks, and the mitigating actions taken or planned.
This enables the Group to assess its overall risk exposure against local and global risk appetites, and to develop a group-wide risk map, identifying any concentrations of risk that may exist, and to identify where risks lie outside risk appetite and mitigating action is required or risk appetite requires revision in light of changing market conditions.
The risk map is refreshed quarterly, and business units are required to escalate material changes intra-quarter.
Regulatory impact on risk and risk assessments The Groups worldwide insurance operations are subject to numerous local regulatory requirements that prescribe the type, quality, and concentration of investments, and the level of assets to be maintained in local currency in order to meet local insurance liabilities.
These requirements help to maintain the Groups market risk at an acceptable level in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are actively and prudently managed, in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Risk management continued b Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, property prices, and foreign currency exchange rates.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group monitors adherence to this market risk policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Group Investment Committee and ultimately to the Asset Liability Management committee.
For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, the Group has put in place additional policies and procedures to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite.
The management of market risk is undertaken in both business units and at Group level.
Business units manage market risks locally using their market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
Business units may also be constrained by the requirement to meet policyholders reasonable expectations and to minimise or avoid market risk in a number of areas.
The Group Investment committee is responsible for managing market risk at Group level, and a number of investment related risks, in particular those faced by them shareholder funds throughout the Group.
The financial impact from changes in market risk such as interest rates, equity prices and property values is examined through stress tests adopted in the Individual Capital Assessments ICA and Financial Condition Reports FCR, which both consider the impact on capital from variations in financial circumstances on either a remote scenario, or to changes from the central operating scenario.
Both consider the management actions that may be taken in mitigation of the change in circumstances.
The sensitivity of Group earnings to changes in economic markets is regularly monitored through sensitivities to investment returns and asset values in EEV reporting.
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required.
The Group has criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimize the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and the liabilities due to market movements.
The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions under which assets and liabilities are to be matched.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
In unit-linked business, the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds, as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the fund.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
221 The Groups shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: Financial direct equity shareholdings in shareholder funds and the Group defined benefit pension funds: statements the indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders funds from which management charges or a share of performance are taken: its interest in the free estate of long-term funds.
At business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements where this lies outside the risk appetite of either the company in respect of shareholder assets or the fund in respect of policyholder assets concerned.
In addition local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of stochastic models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
The Investment Committee actively monitors equity assets owned directly by the Group, which may include some material shareholdings in the Groups strategic business partners.
Concentrations of specific equity holdings eg the strategic holdings are also monitored monthly by the Capital Management Committee.
A sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section g below.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide.
Investment in property is managed at business unit level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders as well as overall risk appetite.
The Investment Committee also actively monitors property assets owned directly by the Group.
At 31 December 2007, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
A sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section g below.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities, which are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate risk also exists in products sold by the group, in particular from policies that carry investment guarantees on early surrender or at maturity, where claim values can become higher than the value of backing assets when interest rates rise or fall.
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements.
However, where any residual mismatch is within our risk appetite, the impact is monitored through economic capital measures such as ICA.
On short-term business such as general insurance business the Group requires a close matching of assets and liabilities to minimise this risk.
Interest rate risk is monitored and managed by the Group Investment Committee, and the Group Asset Liability Management Committee.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include Value-at-Risk analysis, position limits, scenario testing, stress testing and asset and liability matching using measures such as duration.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is regularly monitored.
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors, in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing technical liabilities.
At 31 December 2007, the Group had entered into a number of interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the effects of potential adverse interest rate movements, and to enable close matching of assets and liabilities.
A sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section g below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 47.
Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by Business Units in currencies other than 222 their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities.
For this reason, no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings.
Financial statements The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the Groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling, and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
The Groups foreign exchange policy requires that each of our subsidiaries maintains sufficient assets in its local currency to meet local currency liabilities.
Therefore, capital held by the Groups business units should be able to support local business activities regardless of foreign currency movements.
However, such movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
The Groups foreign exchange policy is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of capital by currency with the Groups capital requirements by currency.
Limits are set to control the extent to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Groups capital requirement for each major currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
At 31 December 2007, the Groups total equity deployment by currency was: Sterling Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Capital at 31 December 2007 4,488 8,655 1,456 1,993 16,592 Capital at 31 December 2006 3,289 7,698 1,508 1,569 14,064 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Risk management continued Net assets are stated after taking account of the effect of currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on net assets.
Apart from the impact on financial instruments covered below, the changes arise from retranslation of Business Unit balance sheets from their functional currencies into sterling, with movements being taken through the currency translation reserve.
These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.

Activity is overseen by the Group Derivatives Committee, which monitors implementation of the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by businesses.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retailsavings products.
Derivative transactions are covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities.
Speculative activity is prohibited, unless approval has been obtained from the Group Derivatives Committee.
Over the counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved counterparties, in accordance with our Group credit policies, thereby reducing the risk of credit loss.
The Group also manages a number of hedge funds which use derivatives extensively within a defined derivative framework.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
Correlation risk The Group recognises that identified lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the ICA in the aggregation of the financial stress tests with the operational risk assessment.
FCRs also consider scenarios involving a number of correlated events.
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the Groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 40. c Credit risk Monitoring credit risk We have a significant exposure to credit risk through our investments in corporate bonds, commercial mortgages, and 223 other securities.
We hold these investments for the benefit of both our policyholders and shareholders.
Financial Credit risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial assets due to counterparties failing to meet all or part of their statements obligations.
The Group risk management framework also includes the market related aspect of credit risk.
This is the risk of a fall in the value of fixed interest securities from changes in the perceived worthiness of the issuer and is manifested through changes in the fixed interest securities credit spreads.
The Groups management of credit risk includes monitoring exposures at a Group level and requiring business units to implement local credit risk policies.
The local business unit credit risk policies involve the establishment and operation of specific risk management committees and the detailed reporting and monitoring of the financial asset portfolio against pre-established risk criteria.
Large individual counterparty exposures exceeding 25 million are aggregated and monitored at Group level against centrally-set limits reflecting the credit ratings by companies such as Standard & Poors.
In addition, the Group evaluates the concentration of exposures by industry sector and geographic region through the Group Credit Committee.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued Credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as speculative grade.
Credit limits for each counterparty are set based on default probabilities that are in turn based on the rating of the counterparty concerned.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with external credit ratings, of the Group at 31 December 2007. Credit rating Carrying value in the Speculative balance sheet AAA AA A BBB grade Not-rated m Debt securities 46.0% 19.6% 20.7% 8.3% 1.1% 4.3% 118,937 Reinsurance assets 14.7% 67.8% 7.4% 0.4% 1.2% 8.5% 8,109 Other investments 1.5% 2.1% 2.1% 2.1% 92.2% 40,413 Loans 3.4% 17.6% 1.0% 0.7% 1.3% 76.0% 36,193 As at 31 December 2006 Credit rating Restated Carrying value in the balance sheet Speculative Restated AAA AA A BBB grade Not-rated m Debt securities 48.6% 17.2% 19.7% 7.7% 0.8% 6.0% 114,466 Reinsurance assets 14.5% 66.9% 5.1% 0.9% 12.6% 7,825 Other investments 3.1% 2.2% 2.8% 0.7% 91.2% 33,050 Loans 8.8%2.9%1.0%0.5%1.4%92.3%28,574 The carrying amount of assets included on the balance sheet represents the maximum credit exposure.
Credit concentration risk The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes.
In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk e. g. in respect of defaults on mortgages or debt matching annuity liabilities this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement, and this credit risk is actively managed.
The impact of aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above.
With the exception of Government bonds the largest aggregated counterparty exposure is 224 approximately 0.5% of the Groups total assets.
Financial statements Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used, and the impact from reinsurer default is measured regularly, in particular through the ICA tests, and is managed accordingly.
Both the Group Credit Committee and Group Reinsurance Security Committee have a monitoring role over this risk.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is National Indemnity Corporation, a member of the Berkshire Hathaway Group.
At 31 December 2007 the reinsurance asset recoverable from National Indemnity Corporation was 1.1 billion.
This exposure is monitored on a regular basis with the forecast to completion monitored for any shortfall in the claims history to verify that the contract is progressing as expected and that no further exposure for the Group will arise.
In the event of a catastrophic event, the counterparty exposure to a single reinsurer is estimated not to exceed 1.1% of shareholders equity.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Risk management continued Unit-linked business As discussed previously, in unit-linked business the policyholder bears the market risk, including credit risk, on investment assets in the unit funds, and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent that their income arises from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
Impairment of financial assets The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.

Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued d Liquidity risk The Group has a strong liquidity position and through the application of a Group Liquidity Management policy seeks to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
In addition to its strong liquidity position, the Group maintains significant committed borrowing facilities from a range of highly rated banks to further mitigate this risk.
Analysis of maturity of liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2007 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS4 Insurance Contracts.
Almost all investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current balance sheet date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current balance sheet liability.
Although we expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, the total liability for non-linked investment contracts is shown in the Within 1 year column below.
Unit-linked contracts are repayable or transferable on demand and therefore excluded from this analysis.

Financial statements Risk management framework The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and guidelines on the practical application of this policy.
Individual life insurance risks are managed at a business unit level.
The management of life insurance risk is undertaken primarily in business units but is also monitored at Group level.
The impact of life insurance risks is monitored by the business units as part of the control cycle of business management.
Exposure is monitored through the assessment of liabilities, the asset liability management framework, profit reporting under both IFRS and EEV, financial condition reporting, and the ICA process.
Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group Risk Monitoring framework and overseen by the Life Insurance Risk Committee.
At Group level the overall exposure to life insurance risk is measured through the ICA, FCRs, and other management reporting.
The Life Insurance Risk Committee monitors the risk framework developed and implemented in each business, and receives management information on life insurance risks.
The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, pricing, unit pricing and expenses.
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses.
It confirms that guidance and procedures are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that businesses adopt a risk management framework to mitigate against any life insurance risk outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite.
The framework adopted in business units is reviewed in detail and approved twice yearly.
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk to ensure best practice is shared throughout the group and common standards are adopted.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Risk management continued Management of life insurance risks The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows business units to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures and monitor the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk.
Longevity risk is carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
Whilst individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a consequence.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity where possible and desirable and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against local market information.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may other wise lapse.
The Group Life insurance Risk Committee has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
Apart from ICA and FCR, sensitivity testing is widely used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to life insurance risks, typically through EEV reporting examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report.
This assessment is taken at both business unit level and at Group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured.
This enables the Group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite.
Concentration risk The Group writes a diverse mix of business in worldwide markets that are all subject to similar risks mortality, persistency etc.
The Group assesses the relative costs and concentrations of each type of risk through the ICA capital requirements and material issues are escalated to and addressed at the Life Insurance Risk Committee.
This analysis enables the Group to assess whether accumulations of risk exceeds risk appetite.
One key concentration of life insurance risk for the Group is improving longevity risk from pensions in payment and deferred annuities in the UK and the Netherlands where the Group has material portfolios.
The Group continually monitors this risk and the opportunities for mitigating actions through reinsurance, improved asset liability matching, or innovative solutions that emerge in the market.
When looking at concentrations of risk, for example market risk, the risk within Aviva staff pension schemes is also considered.
ICA analysis and EEV sensitivity testing help identify both concentrations of risk types and the benefits of diversification of risk.
227 Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features Financial offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their statements benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, option to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity option, guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in ICA and EEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued ii General insurance risk Type of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: Fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: Unexpected claims arising from a single source: Inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten: Inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques: and Inadequate reserves.
The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines.
Like life insurance risk, general insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at a Group level, through a number of general insurance risk committees.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported through the Group Risk monitoring framework.
Additionally, the ICA framework is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the Group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
Increasingly risk-based capital models are being used to support the quantification of risk under the ICA framework.
All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output from which is a key input into the ICA and risk-based capital assessments.
The General Insurance Risk Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure.
It is responsible for the development, implementation, and review of the Group policies for underwriting, claims handling, reinsurance and reserving that operate within the Group risk management framework.
The implementation of these policies and the management of these risks is supported by subcommittees for each of these four areas of risk.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Norwich Union UK Digital Flood Map to effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils.
Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard.
General Insurance claims reserving Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General Insurance Reserving policy.
The General Insurance Risk Committee monitors and maintains the General Insurance 228 Reserving policy, and conducts quarterly reviews of the Groups general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy.
The reviews are conducted under the direction of the Aviva General Insurance Actuarial Director and include peer reviews Financial of the business units own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews.
statements The adequacy of the Groups general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the Group Reserving Committee, which covers both life and general insurance reserving.
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries often as part of the local regulatory requirement.
Reinsurance strategy Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
Reinsurance purchases must be in line with the strategy set out in our Group reinsurance policy.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by extensive financial and capital modelling and actuarial analysis to optimise the cost and capital efficiency benefits.
For the larger business units, this involves utilising externally sourced probabilistic models to verify the accumulations and loss probabilities based on the Groups specific portfolios of business.
Where external models are not available, scenarios are developed and tested using the Groups data to determine potential losses and appropriate levels of reinsurance protection.
The reinsurance is placed with providers who meet the Groups counterparty security requirements, and large reinsurance placements may also require approval from the Group Asset Liability Management Committee.
Concentration risk Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a Group level.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
Avivas total retained risk increases as catastrophe events become more remote, so that the total Group loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure Northern European windstorm is approximately 370 million, on a one in ten years basis, compared to approximately 700 million when measured on a one in 100 years basis.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 55 Risk management continued f Operational risk Types of operational risk Operational risk arises as a result of inadequately controlled internal processes or systems, human error, or from external events.
This definition is intended to include all risks to which the Group is exposed, other than the financial risks described previously, and strategic and Group risks that are considered elsewhere.
It includes risks relating to: Regulation, information technology, financial crime, business protection, human resources, outsourcing, purchasing, communications and legal Brand management, customer management, products, sales management and distribution Financial processes including financial reporting and taxation External development Risk management framework In accordance with Group policies, business unit management has primary responsibility for the effective identification, management, monitoring and reporting of risks to the business unit executive management team and to Group as part of the quarterly risk reporting process.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Impact assessments are made against financial, operational and reputational criteria.
Business unit risk management and governance functions are responsible for implementing the Group risk management methodologies and frameworks to assist line management in this work.
They also provide support and independent challenge on the completeness, accuracy and consistency of risk assessments, and the adequacy of mitigating action plans.
As a result, the business unit executive management team satisfies itself that all material risks falling outside our risk appetite are being mitigated, monitored and reported at an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high impact level are continually monitored centrally.
The Group Operational Risk Committee ORC oversees the Groups aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the Group Executive Committee and reports to the Board Risk & Regulatory Committee.
It makes recommendations on the risk appetite that the group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
The ORC operates a number of sub-committees which focus on specific areas of operational risk covering business protection, IT, compliance, human resources, and business standards.
g Risk and capital management Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Primarily, EEV, ICA, and FCRs are used.
229 Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on all of the Groups financial performance measurements to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for Financial identifying and quantifying the risks that each of its business units, and the Group as a whole are exposed to.
statements For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of EEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and noneconomic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on EEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an EEV basis in the supplementary notes to this report.
Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates, and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under EEV methodology.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims development on which the projections are based.
As such, in the analysis below, the sensitivity of general insurance claim liabilities is primarily based on the financial impact of changes to the reported loss ratio.
Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 55 Risk management continued Sensititvity test results Some results of sensitivity testing for long-term business, general insurance and health business and the fund management and non-insurance business are set out below.
For each sensitivity test the impact of a reasonably possible change in a single factor is shown, with other assumptions left unchanged.
Sensitivity Factor Description of sensitivity factor applied Interest rate and investment return The impact of a change in market interest rates by 1% eg if a current interest rate is 5%, the impact of an immediate change to 4% and 6%.
The test allows consistently for similar changes to investment returns and movements in the market value of backing fixed interest securities.
Expenses The impact of an increase in maintenance expenses by 10%.
Equity property market values The impact of a change in equity property market values by 10%.
Assurance mortality morbidity life insurance only The impact of an increase in mortality morbidity rates for assurance contracts by 5%.

The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK, USA and the Netherlands.
In the UK and USA, a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders funds, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
In the USA most debt securities are classified as available-for-sale, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate movements.
In contrast, a rise in market interest rates has a positive impact for non-participating business in the Netherlands, due to the effect of minimum investment return guarantees, which acts to partly offset the impacts in the UK and USA.
The sensitivity to movements in equity and property market values relates mainly to holdings in the Netherlands, although the impact on IFRS profit is moderated by the classification of equities as available for sale.
Changes in sensitivities between 2006 and 2007 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities, and asset liability management actions.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK and Ireland.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the EEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, the 232 actual impact of a change in the assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets are held at market value on the balance sheet.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to Financial volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and statements equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty: and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
Sensitivity of fair values not derived from market information.
Assets are held at fair value in accordance with the relevant accounting policy.
The majority of such assets are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage less than 1% of total assets recorded at fair value, are based on estimates.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Whilst such valuations are sensitive to estimates, it is believed that changing one or more of the assumptions to reasonably possible alternative assumptions would not change the fair value significantly.

Financial statements 59 Post-balance sheet event Special bonus declared by UK Life business On 5 February 2008, the Groups UK long-term business operation, Norwich Union Life, announced a one-off, special bonus worth an estimated 2.3 billion, benefiting around 1.1 million with-profit policyholders in its CGNU Life and CULAC with-profit funds.
This special bonus has been made possible by the strength of the two with-profit funds and a change to the investment strategy for supporting policy guarantees.
This has enabled the business to free up a significant part of the inherited estate included within the unallocated divisible surplus for payment to policyholders.
This change will not affect normal policy returns, nor will it impact on policyholders security or alter the type of investments backing their policies.
The bonus will be used to enhance policy values by around 10% in total, in three instalments, with the qualifying dates being 1 January 2008, 1 January 2009 and 1 January 2010.
In accordance with the way the funds are managed, the bonus distribution is being split on a 90 10 basis between policyholders and shareholders.
Over the three years, policyholders will receive a total currently estimated as 2,127 million and shareholders will receive a total currently estimated as 236 million.
As explained in accounting policy K and note 38 b, the Groups insurance and participating investment contract liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts, and FRS 27, Life Assurance.
The latter requires liabilities for with-profit funds falling within the scope of the UKs Financial Services Authoritys capital regime to be determined in accordance with this regime, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
This requires us to recognise planned discretionary bonuses within policyholder liabilities at the balance sheet date, even if there was no constructive obligation at the time.
As a result of the announcement made above, a transfer of 2,127 million has been made from the unallocated divisible surplus note 43 in order to increase insurance liabilities by 1,728 million note 38 b and participating investment contract liabilities by 399 million note 39 c. In compliance with paragraph 4 a of FRS 27, the insurance liabilities on a realistic basis exclude any shareholders interest in this bonus.
Furthermore, no profit arising to shareholders has been accrued in these financial statements as the payment to them was not a constructive obligation at the balance sheet date.
