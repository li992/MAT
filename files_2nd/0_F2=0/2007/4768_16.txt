MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 39 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 39 Notes to the financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation European law requires that the Groups consolidated financial statements for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 are prepared in accordance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historic cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities.
This will also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.
Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements are presented in the form of Group financial statements.
The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of the Company and the entities controlled by the Company including all of its subsidiary entities after eliminating internal transactions and recognising any minority interests in those entities.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 IFRS 7, Financial instruments disclosures, these have been implemented in the period.
This standard does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Groups financial instruments.
IFRIC 10, Interim financial reporting and impairment, prohibits the impairment losses recognised in an interim period on goodwill and investments in equity instruments and in financial assets carried at cost to be reversed at a subsequent balance sheet date.
This standard does not have any impact on the Groups financial statements.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items are principally: professional fees relating to capital restructuring where they cannot be offset against amounts borrowed in accordance with IAS 23: and nonrecurring changes in taxation following the implementation of new legislation.
Prearranged funeral plan trusts The three prearranged funeral plan trusts were not consolidated during the period as they were not controlled by the Group.
Specifically, Article 60 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 Regulated Activities order 2001 requires a majority of the managing trustees to be independent of the Group.
Furthermore, the Group did not direct their financial and operating policies, nor did it have substantially all of the risks and rewards of their ownership.
Acquisition or disposal of subsidiary undertakings Results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the period are included from the effective date of control using the acquisition method of accounting.
The separable net assets, both tangible and intangible, of newly acquired subsidiary undertakings are incorporated into the financial statements on the basis of the fair value to the Group as at the effective date of control.
Revenue Revenue from funeral operations comprises the amount recoverable from customers for the provision of funerals, income from crematoria and other services, to the extent that those services have been performed or the goods supplied.
Income from memorial sales is recognised at the point of sale, to the extent that the goods have been supplied.
Costs of maintaining memorials are recognised as incurred.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 40 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 40 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued The accounting policies for recognising turnover for prearranged funeral plans are stated below.
The Group pays certain disbursements such as crematoria fees, burial plots, ministers fees and doctors fees on behalf of its clients.
These amounts are recovered as part of the invoicing process.
However, these amounts are not included within net revenues as they are simply passed on to the customer at cost.
The Group views the UK as one geographical segment, given each local business exhibits similar long term characteristics.
All amounts are exclusive of VAT.
Prearranged funeral plans Trust plans The Group markets and sells prearranged funeral plans, monies received from selling funeral plans being held and controlled by independent prearranged funeral plan trusts the Trusts.
The responsibility for the ultimate performance of funerals is allocated to funeral directors, who are selected by the beneficiary of the plan and some of whom are not owned by the Group.
The Group receives monies from the Trusts in respect of the following transactions: A marketing and administration fee in respect of each plan sold.
The marketing element is refundable in the event that the plan is subsequently cancelled.
A provision is made for cancellations, where material, to cover the estimated marketing element refundable to the Trusts.
Marketing and administration fees are included in Group revenue when the related plan is sold.
Further contributions are also received from the Trusts in return for the provision of general ongoing administrative services supplied to the Trusts.
These contributions are included in Group revenue for the period to which they relate.
All costs in respect of the marketing and administration of the prearranged funeral plans are expensed in the Group income statement as incurred.
From time to time, the Group receives monies from certain of the Trusts, in line with the relevant Trusts deed, which have been assessed by the trustees as not required to ensure the Trust has sufficient assets to meet its future liabilities in respect of current members Recoveries.
All Recoveries are recognised as other operating income in the period in which the trustees approve their payment.
The Group makes payments on behalf of the Trusts relating to the ongoing overheads of the Trusts, refunds to members of the Trusts in event of cancellation, and the payments made to funeral directors when the funeral is ultimately performed.
All such payments are reimbursed in full by the Trusts on demand, in accordance with the terms of the relevant Trusts deed.
Neither the sales value of plans nor the costs of providing funerals are recognised in the financial statements of the Group when a prearranged funeral plan is sold.
Each Dignity marketing company contractually guarantees with the customer of a prearranged funeral plan that i if the customer chooses to cancel their selected funeral plan, a full refund will be made to the customer of all monies paid in respect thereof less in certain cases an administration fee payable to the relevant Dignity marketing company : ii the funeral directors services as selected by the customer will be provided regardless of price rises in the future: and iii for certain plans sold, specific disbursements will be provided regardless of price rises in the future.
Insurance plans Previously marketed propositions The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by an insurance company in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral including some disbursements of the plan holder at no further charge.
Marketing of these policies has now ceased.
In the event of death of the policyholder, the Group makes an agreed payment to the nominated funeral director and a debtor is recognised.
At this time a commission fee is recognised as turnover.
All monies are reclaimed in full from the life insurance company.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 41 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 41 Actively marketed propositions The Group is the named beneficiary on a number of life assurance products sold by third party insurance companies, in consideration for which the Group has committed to performing the funeral including some disbursements of the plan holder at no further charge.
A commission is paid when the policy is charged to the Group.
As this commission is fully refundable if the Group does not perform the funeral for any reason, it is carried as a debtor and expensed when the funeral is performed.
Sharebased payments The Group issues equity settled sharebased payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
Management measures the fair value using the valuation technique that they consider to be the most appropriate to value each class of award, which include BlackScholes calculations and Monte Carlo simulations.
The valuations take into account factors such as nontransferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straightline basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will eventually vest.
The estimate of the level of vesting is reviewed at least annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic Earnings per Ordinary Share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit on ordinary activities after taxation and minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period.
Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing profit on ordinary activities after taxation and minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period increased by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares primarily share options.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill, which represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration for subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is capitalised and stated at historical cost less provisions for impairment.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The business and subsidiaries acquired are generally combined with existing operations in the year of acquisition.
For this reason, the cashgenerating units typically consist of those business segments, which are engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
Intangible assets trade names Intangible trade names are recognised as assets at the fair value of the consideration paid to acquire them and are carried at historical cost less provisions for amortisation and impairment.
When acquired as part of a business combination the fair value is calculated by reference to the estimated incremental cash flows expected to arise by virtue of the trade name being wellestablished.
Amortisation is provided from the date of acquisition so as to writeoff the asset on a straightline basis over the term of its useful life.
Where there are indicators that a trade name has an indefinite life then these assets are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
The factors that indicate an indefinite life of trade names acquired include the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a wellestablished market with inelastic demand, the conservative nature of the UK funeral industry that acts as a barrier to entry for new trade names, and the Groups track record for actively monitoring and relocating trade names to combat shifting demographics.
In addition, when allocating a useful life to acquired trade names, the following matters are considered: The strength of the trade name in its local environment which is assessed by reference to relative market share and anticipated profitability: The likelihood that market based factors could truncate a trade names life such as competition and shifting demographics and the Groups ability to combat these: The length of time, prior to acquisition, for which trade has been conducted under the name acquired: and The likely support the Group will give to the name in its local environment through marketing and promotion, maintaining community awareness etc.
The useful lives of all capitalised trade names are considered to be indefinite and are reviewed on a regular basis.
Intangible assets noncompete contracts Noncompete contracts arising from business combinations are capitalised at the fair value, which is calculated as the present value of any consideration paid discounted at the Groups cost of capital.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 42 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 42 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued All costs are amortised over the term of the relevant agreement on a straightline basis.
Intangible assets software Where computer software is not an integral part of a related item of computer hardware, the software is treated as an intangible asset.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of costs incurred to acquire and bring into use the specific software.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups development of computer systems including websites is recognised if and only if the costs are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products, controlled by the Group and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group.
All other costs incurred in research or development are expensed as incurred.
Capitalised costs will include, where appropriate, directly attributable payroll costs and a portion of direct overheads.
Costs recognised as assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives three to eight years.
Intangible assets use of third party brand On 8 January 2007, the Group acquired the remaining 25 per cent voting share capital of Advance Planning Limited for consideration of 2.0 million.
As part of this arrangement, the Group obtained a 10year marketing commitment from Age Concern Enterprises Limited, the previous minority shareholder, giving rights to use the Age Concern brand for the next ten years.
The value of this right has been recognised as a separate intangible asset.
This asset is being amortised over twenty years on a straightline basis, recognising that each years additional marketing activity generates incremental revenues and profits to the Group for at least the following twenty years.
Property, plant and equipment Assets are recorded in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes, where appropriate, directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each asset to its present location and condition.
Depreciation is charged excluding freehold land and assets in the course of construction so as to write off the cost of assets to their residual value, over their expected useful lives using the straightline method.
The bases and annual depreciation rates in use for the various classes of assets are as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% 10% Short leasehold buildings Over term of lease Motor vehicles 11% 20% Computers 20% Other plant and equipment 5% 33% Fixtures and fittings 15% Freehold land is not depreciated on the basis that land has an unlimited life.
Where the historical cost of land and buildings cannot be split, the Directors have estimated that the historical cost attributable to land is one third of the original cost of acquiring the land and buildings.
This estimate is regularly reviewed.
Major renovations of the Groups trading premises and crematory relinings are depreciated over the remaining life of the related asset or to the estimated date of the next major renovation or cremator relining, whichever is sooner.
Depreciation rates and residual values for each class of asset are reviewed annually.
Repairs and renewals All repairs and renewals are charged to the income statement unless they represent an enhancement to the original asset.
Property, plant and equipment held under leases When assets are financed by leasing agreements, where the risks and rewards are substantially transferred to the Group, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased outright and the corresponding liability to the lessor is included as an obligation under finance leases.
Depreciation on leased assets is charged to the income statement on the same basis as owned assets.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding lease obligation.
All other leases are operating leases and the relevant annual rentals are charged to the income statement.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 43 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 43 Impairment of assets The carrying values of intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Assets that have an indefinite useful life e. g. goodwill are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future discounted cash flows of the cashgenerating unit are estimated, based on latest budgets for the following year and an annual growth rate of UK GDP in subsequent years.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the particular segment and compared to the carrying value of the relevant asset.
Any impairment in the value of an asset below its carrying value is charged to the income statement within operating profit.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the original loss was recognised.
Inventories Inventories, which comprise funeral supplies and monumental masonry, are stated at the lower of cost and fair value less costs to sell.
Cost includes all directly attributable costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Fair value less costs to sell is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred in completion and sale.
Taxation The tax charge for the period includes the charge for tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The current tax charge represents the estimated amount due that arises from the operations of the Group in the period and after making adjustments to estimates in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, except where the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised where the carrying value of an asset is greater than its associated tax basis or where the carrying value of a liability is less than its associated tax basis.
Deferred tax is provided for any differences that exist between the tax base and accounting base of intangibles arising from a business combination that does not involve the acquisition of a subsidiary.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis.
Pensions The cost of defined contribution retirement schemes is charged as an expense as the costs become payable.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short term asset or liability.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing the benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit.
The expected return on plan assets less the interest arising on the pension liabilities is presented within net interest payable.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement and presented in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The expected return on plan assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension plan.
The retirement benefit net asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost net of the fair value of any relevant scheme assets.
The discount rate applied in arriving at the present value represents yields on high quality corporate bonds in a similar economic environment with lives similar to the maturity of the pension liabilities.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 44 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 44 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 1 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company or the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and where a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Provisions other than deferred tax are discounted where the present value of the provision is materially different to the undiscounted value.
The unwinding of discounts is included within net interest payable and similar charges.
Dividends Interim dividends payable are recognised when they are paid.
Year end dividends are recognised when they are appropriately approved.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions recognised in the income statement are translated into Sterling at the exchange rate on the date the transaction took place.
Financial instruments Borrowings All borrowings are stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of transaction costs.
The transaction costs and interest payable on debt finance are charged to the income statement, as finance costs, on a constantyield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where it is more likely than not that the lender will require earlier repayment using the effective interest method.
Early termination costs on borrowings Premiums and discounts arising on the early repayment of borrowings are writtenoff to the income statement as incurred.
Interest rate swaps The Group currently uses several types of financial instruments as part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy.
It does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes.
Interest rate risk associated with net debt is managed by using a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings and financial liabilities.
The cash flows from, and losses arising on terminations of, these contracts are recognised as cash flows from operating activities.
See note 16 d for further information.
Trade receivables Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
A provision for impairment is established based on historical experience.
When a trade receivable is not collectable it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct transaction costs.
Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recorded in the financial statements when paid.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits.
Standards, amendments and interpretations effective in 2007 but not relevant The following standard, amendments and interpretations to published standards are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007 but they are not relevant to the Groups operations: IFRS 4, Insurance contracts IFRIC 7, Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29, Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9, Reassessment of embedded derivatives.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 45 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 45 Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 29 December 2007 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted: IFRS 8, Operating segments.
This standard is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and introduces new rules on the disclosure of operating results by business segment.
IFRIC 11, IFRS 2, Group and treasury transactions.
It provides guidance an whether sharebased payments involving treasury shares or involving group entities for example, options over a parents shares should be accounted for as equitysettled or cashsettled sharebased payment in the standalone accounts of the parent and Group companies.
This is not expected to have any impact on the Groups accounts.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19, the limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction.
IFRIC 14 provides guidance on assessing the limit in IAS 19 on the amount of the surplus that can be recognised as an asset.
It also explains how the pension asset or liability may be affected by a statutory or contractual minimum funding requirement.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from 1 January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
The amendment to the standard is still subject to endorsement by the European Union.
It requires an entity to capitalise borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset one that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale as part of the cost of that asset.
The option of immediately expensing those borrowing costs will be removed.
The Group will apply IAS 23 Amended from 1 January 2009, subject to endorsement by the EU but is currently not applicable to the Group as there are no qualifying assets.
Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and not relevant for the Groups operations The following interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 28 December 2007 or later periods but are not relevant for the Groups operations: IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements.
IFRIC 12 is not relevant to the Groups operations as it does not have any service concession arrangements.
IFRIC 13 is not relevant to the Groups operations as it does not operate any loyalty programs.
Critical accounting estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect reported amounts.
The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements are in the areas of assessing the recoverability of receivables and postretirement benefits.
Provision for doubtful trade receivables Provision is made against accounts that in the estimation of management may be impaired.
Within each division, assessment is made of the recoverability of trade receivables based on a range of factors including the age of the receivable and the type of services provided.
The provision is assessed monthly against actual experience of irrecoverable accounts and adjusted if appropriate.
The Group held a provision for impairment of trade receivables at the balance sheet date of 2.5 million 2006: 2.8 million.
Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme that is accounted for using methods that rely on actuarial assumptions to estimate costs and liabilities for inclusion in the financial statements.
These actuarial assumptions include discount rates, assumed rates of return, salary increases and mortality rates.
While management believes that the actuarial assumptions are appropriate, any significant changes to those used would affect the balance sheet and income statement.
The Group considers that the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets.
Employee share trust The assets of the employee share trust are held by a separate limited company, of which the directors consider that Dignity plc has fide facto control.
In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the substance of the transaction, the trusts assets and liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet within share capital and reserves.
MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 46 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 46 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 2 Financial risk management The Group finances its operations by a mixture of shareholders funds, Secured Notes, with other bank borrowings available if required.
This approach seeks to minimise financing costs and generate optimum shareholder value through efficient leveraging of the Groups balance sheet, which is made possible by the stable and predictable cash generative nature of the business.
It is not the Group policy to actively trade in derivatives.
Market risk Currency risk All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are denominated in Sterling.
The Group purchases minimal amounts from overseas.
Accordingly, exposure to currency fluctuations are not significant and therefore not actively managed.
Interest rate risk and other price risk The Groups main borrowings consist of Class A and B Secured Notes, which are at fixed interest rates, resulting in a predetermined repayment profile.
The fair value of these financial instruments is based on underlying gilt prices and yield spreads based on the markets current view of the risk profile of the Secured Notes.
Consequently, the fair value of these instruments will fluctuate.
Fair values are not relevant to the Group unless it was to change its funding strategy and repays the Secured Notes early.
The Group has significant cash balances that are held by institutions rated at least A1 by Standard and Poors.
These balances earn interest by reference to the Bank of England base rate.
If base rates reduced by one per cent at the beginning of 2008 then the Group would receive 0.1 million less interest income on a annualised basis for each 10 million held.
Given the level of cash held during the period the Group does not consider this to be a significant exposure.
None of the Groups other financial liabilities or financial assets carry any significant interest rate risk.
Credit risk Trade receivables are the main source of credit risk to the Group.
However, this risk is minimised as much as possible through wellestablished credit control procedures.
Quantitative disclosures regarding the aging of these receivables are included in note 21 c. Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash reserves, committed undrawn borrowing facilities and regular monitoring and forecasting of cash balances.
In addition, the Group is required under the terms of its secured borrowings to maintain a precisely defined EBITDA to total debt service ratio of at least 1.5:1.
This ratio was determined when raising the debt as being sufficient to ensure all borrowings could be repaid.
Capital risk management The Groups objective under managing capital is to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, repay holders of Class A and B Secured Notes and benefit other shareholders.
It also aims to reduce its cost of capital by maintaining an optimal capital structure.
In order to achieve these expectations, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or issue further Class A and B Secured Notes.
During the period, the Group achieved its covenants under the terms of the Groups secured borrowings see Liquidity risk above.
3 Revenue and segmental analysis As described in the Business Review and Financial Review, the Group is organised into three main business segments: funeral services, crematoria and prearranged funeral plans.
Funeral services represent the sale of funerals and memorials at the time of need.
Crematoria represent the performance of cremations at the time of need, together with the sale of memorials at the time of need and in advance.
Prearranged funeral plans represent the revenue from the sale of funerals in advance to customers wishing to make their own funeral arrangements, and the marketing and administration costs associated with making such sales.

In June 2007, legislation was passed confirming that the rate of Corporation Tax would reduce from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 1 April 2008.
As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax income of 0.5 million through its income statement to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Groups deferred tax provision.
This also had the effect of reducing the Groups effective tax rate excluding the nonrecurring adjustment to 30 per cent in 2007, compared to 31 per cent in the previous period.
The Group anticipates its effective tax rate will transition to 29 per cent in the 2009 financial period and beyond following these legislative changes.

Accordingly, it is too early to have completed any detailed analysis on any new proposals announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
The Group will make appropriate announcements in due course as required by the Listing Rules if any aspect is considered to have a material effect on the Groups earnings.
Further legislation is anticipated in respect of Industrial Buildings Allowances.
If this is substantially enacted in the form expected in 2008, then this will result in a one off charge to the income statement of 0.5 million.

This will be paid on 27 June 2008 provided approval is gained from shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2008 and will be paid to shareholders on the register at close of business on 6 June 2008.
8 Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per Ordinary Share has been based on the profit for the relevant period.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.
The Group has two classes of potentially dilutive Ordinary Shares being those share options granted to employees under the Groups SAYE Scheme and the contingently issueable shares under the Groups LTIP Schemes.
At the balance sheet date, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the LTIP Schemes had not been met and these contingently issueable shares have been excluded from the diluted EPS calculations.
The Board believes that profit on ordinary activities before exceptional items, profit on sale of fixed assets and after taxation is a useful indication of the Groups performance, as it excludes significant nonrecurring items.
This reporting measure is defined as Underlying profit after taxation in the Financial Review.
Accordingly, the Board believes that earnings per share calculated by reference to this underlying profit after taxation is also a useful indicator of financial performance.
Reconciliations of the earnings and the weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
Weighted average number of Per share Earnings shares amount m millions pence 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 21.6 62.8 34.4 Deduct: Exceptional items and profit on sale of fixed assets net of taxation 0.6 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 21.0 62.8 33.4 52 week period ended 29 December 2006 Profit attributable to shareholders Basic and diluted EPS 18.8 72.6 25.9 Add back: Exceptional items net of taxation 0.5 Underlying profit after taxation Basic EPS 19.3 72.6 26.6 In 2007, the potential issue of new shares pursuant to the Groups share option plans in the period would not affect the earnings per share 2006: would affect earnings per share by less than 0.1 pence per share if exercised.

However, the assets allocated to head office are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The valueinuse calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest annual budgets approved by management.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates based on historical death rates supplied by ONS, anticipated market share based on actual experience and anticipated price increases.
Cash flows beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using the historic UK GDP growth rate.
The cash flows are discounted at a pretax rate of 9.2 per cent 2006: 9.2 per cent.
Given the stability and predictability of the industry, cash flows for the following 20 years have been taken into account.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment 2006: nil.
Included within plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings net book value is 1.5 million 2006: 1.0 million relating to assets held in the course of construction.

The loan was repaid in full in the second quarter of the 52 week period.
b Prepayments This balance represents the amounts paid to acquire the long leasehold interest in land at certain of the Groups properties.

MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 57 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 57 16 Financial liabilities continued d Other financial liabilities On 20 December 2002, Dignity 2002 Limited entered into contracts to swap the floating rate interest on a bank loan into fixed rate.
Contractually, these swaps were not effective until 30 April 2003.
On 11 April 2003, as described in note 16 a, the Group issued Secured Notes at a fixed rate of interest.
These notes replaced the bank loan.
Consequently, the swaps were no longer required as the Group had no interest rate risk on the Secured Notes.
As result, the Group entered into further contracts on 11 April 2003 to swap fixed rate interest into floating in order to offset the original swaps and eliminate any interest rate risk in this regard.
As a result of interest rate movements between these two dates, the combined effect of all the contracts was that the Group makes fixed and determinable biannual payments on a notional principal amount.
These swap agreements were entered into under one ISDA master agreement.
This master agreement forces the swaps to be viewed and settled on a net basis only: a position that cannot be altered without the written consent of both parties.
Accordingly, the overall transaction represents a financial liability.
The fair value represents the discounted net present value of future cash flows.
Further, as these contracts related to the raising of the Secured Notes, the liability has been accounted for as a transaction cost of the Class A and B Secured Notes and is being amortised in accordance with IAS 39. e Current financial liabilities The current financial liabilities represent the amounts falling due within one year of the Groups accounting reference date, 31 December.

Therefore, where the Group has entered into leases with a tenantrepairing clause, it is also responsible for the control of asbestos.
The provision includes the expected rectification costs of properties not yet surveyed for asbestos plus the estimated costs of surveying these properties.
It is anticipated that the provision will be utilised by the end of 2008. c Onerous contracts The Group has provided for the discounted future costs of certain contracts to which the Group is legally bound.
These contracts relate to vacant leasehold properties and other contracts from which no economic benefit is derived.
The provision will be utilised over the term of the contracts and it is anticipated that it will be fully utilised after nine years.
Included within the provision is an amount of 0.2 million 2006: 0.1 million relating to the expected costs of ongoing rent reviews, the outcomes of which have been based on recent experience of similar reviews on other properties.
d Cancellation provision As described in note 1, the Group receives monies from certain prearranged funeral plan Trusts in respect of the marketing of prearranged funeral plans, which are refundable to the trust in the event of cancellation.
The provision covers the expected cost of such cancellations anticipated to occur in future years relating to plans sold before the balance sheet date and is anticipated to be utilised over the next three years.

No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of losses within the Group amounting to 4.1 million net at 28 per cent 2006: 4.4 million net at 30 per cent.
Based on the current debt structure of the Group and the nature of these losses, the Directors do not consider that taxable profits will arise in the relevant company from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable recoverable within one year.
However, the Directors consider that it is not possible to quantify the amount because of a significant level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.
The deferred income tax credited charged to equity during the period was as follows: 2007 2006 m m Deferred tax charge on actuarial gains on retirement benefit obligations 1.5 0.7 Deferred tax charge credit on employee share options 0.8 1.0 MAC RF63322 C1 8 4 08 08:27 Page 60 Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2007 Group Accounts 60 Notes to the financial statements continued for the 52 week period ended 28 December 2007 21 Financial instruments Fair values of nonderivative financial assets and financial liabilities Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at relevant interest rates.

These have been accounted for under the acquisition method.
All intangible assets were recognised at their respective fair values.
The residual excess over the net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
This represents the value to the Group of the funeral locations.
The fair value adjustments contain some provisional amounts, which will be finalised in 2008.
These adjustments reflect the recognition of trade names and associated deferred taxation and adjustments to reflect the fair value of other working capital.
The businesses acquired have their assets and liabilities amalgamated within the existing business structure and as such, it is impractical to determine, without undue expense and delay due to the immaterial size of each, the post acquisition results.
The profit before tax generated by APL in the period was 1.7 million.
It is also not possible to quantify the results of these businesses prior to acquisition as it represents confidential information relating to the vendors, which the Directors do not have authority to disclose.

These companies have sold prearranged funeral plans to their clients in the past.
All monies from these sales are held and controlled by three independent Trusts, being the National Funeral Trust, the Dignity Limited Trust Fund and the Trust for Age Concern Funeral Plans respectively.
Full details of the transactions can be found in the financial statements of these companies, which are available from Plantsbrook House, 94 The Parade, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, B72 1PH.
The Group has given commitments to certain of these clients to perform their funeral.
The cost of the performance of these funerals will be paid out of the funds held in the Trusts.
It is the view of the Directors that none of these commitments are onerous to the Group.

In the opinion of the Directors no liability is likely to crystallise in respect of these guarantees.
On 28 August 2007, the Group acquired the trade and assets of seven funeral locations.
As part of this acquisition there is a contingent consideration clause, payable during 2009.
The maximum amount payable in accordance with this clause is 1.8 million.
However, at 28 December 2007, no provision has been recognised in respect of this clause as the Board do not believe that any further consideration will be payable, based on information currently available.
