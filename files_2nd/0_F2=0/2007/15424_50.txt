22 Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Capital risk management The groups objectives when managing its capital base are to safeguard the groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure between equity and debt to minimise the cost of overall capital employed in the business.
Consistent with others in the industry, the group monitors the capital structure by reference to the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and the gearing ratio, defined as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is defined as borrowings net of arrangement fees and the fair value of interest rate swaps, and obligations under finance leases, less cash.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
In 2007, the group completed the share buy back programme it initiated in 2006, through which 100.0m was returned to shareholders.
In July 2007, the group significantly diversified its debt financing with the completion of the 162.7m private placement described in note 19.
As a result of these activities and acquisitions made in 2007, its gearing ratio increased from 68.7% at 31 December 2006 to 75.4% at 31 December 2007.
Further analysis of the movement in net debt in the year is given in note 29.
23 Retirement benefit obligations The group operates a number of pension and post-retirement benefit plans for its employees throughout the world, as well as complying with local laws and regulations relating to the payment of retirement benefits.
The assets of all funded pension plans are held separately from those of the group, and full actuarial valuations are performed at least every three years.
Contributions in 2008 are expected to be consistent with 2007 levels.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily defined contribution plans and the groups contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
There are also two defined benefit final salary plans, which are closed to new members and future accruals.
Independent qualified actuaries performed valuations for these in 2007 and 2006 using the projected unit method, details of which are given below.
France Companies in France participate in compulsory state arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum be paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
The provisions required to meet these amounts were assessed by independent qualified actuaries in 2007 and 2006 and details of their valuations are provided below.
US The group operates both defined contribution and defined benefit final salary pension plans in the US.
Unfunded post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans are also operated, which at 31 December contributed 0.7m 2006: 1.1m to the total US defined benefit pension obligation disclosed below.
All defined benefit plans, and the healthcare and life assurance plans, have been valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2007 and 2006 and details are given in aggregate below.
Netherlands The Dutch defined benefit final salary plan operated by the group is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualified actuaries in 2007 and 2006, using the projected unit method.
Other countries Where there are local arrangements to provide lump sum payments and other post employment benefits, provision has been made for the liabilities identified based on local actuarial assessments.
Details of these arrangements are given in aggregate in the following pages.
