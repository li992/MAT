76 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Investment in joint ventures The group has the following significant interests in joint ventures: a The group owns 100% of the equity of Wackenhut Services, Inc. WSI under US Foreign Ownership Controlling Interest provisions, governed through a proxy agreement.
WSI provides security services to US Government agencies including security services on sites deemed to be strategically sensitive.
In accordance with the proxy agreement the group is excluded from access to operational information and is represented by directors on the WSI board who are independent of the group but under fiduciary and contractual obligation to act in the best interest of the shareholder.
The group, through the proxy agreement, retains the power to veto certain material operational and strategic decisions.
As day to day management of the business remains with an independent board, WSI is accounted for as a joint venture.
This means that the group proportionately consolidates the results of WSI at 100%, giving rise to an accounting result identical to that which would be the case if WSI were accounted for as a subsidiary.
b At the year end the group owned 59% of the equity of Bridgend Custodial Services Ltd and 50% of the equity in STC Milton Keynes Ltd.
In both cases, the group jointly shares operational and financial control over the operations and is therefore entitled to a proportionate share of the results of each, which are consolidated on the basis of the equity shares held.
In addition, at 31 December 2006, the groups 49% equity shareholding in Safeguards Securicor Sdn Bhd, in Malaysia, was accounted for as a joint venture.
During 2007, the group obtained control of this operation which is now accounted for as a subsidiary.
The results of each of the jointly controlled operations are prepared in accordance with group accounting policies.
Amounts proportionately consolidated into the groups financial statements are as follows: Results 2007 2006 m m Income 320.6 344.4 Expenses 307.1 326.4 Profit after tax 13.5 18.0 Balance sheet 2007 2006 m m Assets Non-current assets 54.5 49.7 Current assets 92.6 75.8 147.1 125.5 Liabilities Current liabilities 56.3 41.6 Non-current liabilities 52.5 43.2 108.8 84.8 Net assets 38.3 40.7 22 Investment in associates The groups share of associates profit and net assets and the reconciliation to the net investment are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Total assets 14.2 13.1 Total liabilities 4.0 5.8 Net investment in associates 10.2 7.3 Revenue 75.8 83.6 Profit for the year 3.0 2.8 The net investment and results presented above largely relate to Space Gateway Support LLC, in the USA, in which the group holds an investment of 46%.
