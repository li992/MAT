Additionally, all employees can elect to participate in the Worldwide Employee Share Plan WESP, which operates on a Save as You Earn basis.
For grants during 2007, the fair value was estimated using either the Black-Scholes-Merton model or the Monte Carlo model and is charged to the income statement over the minimum life of the grants.
The Black-Scholes-Merton model was selected to value options and to value performance shares granted with EPS performance criteria because the grants are not complex in nature and the method is straightforward to use.
This model values such grants as if they were tradeable options and generates a single outcome using the assumptions noted below, which can then be adjusted to reflect estimates of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria or employee decisions.
The Monte Carlo model was selected to value shares granted with performance criteria based on the Total Shareholder Return of TNS relative to other companies because these are market based criteria and require simulation of multiple possible outcomes to derive an estimated value.
This model values such options by simulating tens of thousands of possible outcomes for TNS and each company in the comparator group, calculating the expected gain for each simulated outcome and discounting the average of these gains to give a present value.
This valuation already includes the probability of lapsing due to non-achievement of performance criteria.
The fair values per option granted during the year and the key assumptions used are as follows: Nature of grant LTIP EPS WESP LTIP EPS LTIP EPS LTIP TSR Grant date April April June October October Valuation model BSM BSM BSM BSM Monte Carlo Share price at grant date 235.3p 244.3p 246.0p 215.5p 215.5p Exercise price 194.1p Expected volatility based on 5 year historical volatility 31.2% 31.2% 31.2% 31.2% 31.2% Average expected period to exercise years 3 5 3 3 3 Risk free rate yield on zero-coupon government bonds 5.3% 5.3% 5.3% 5.3% 5.3% Expected dividends expressed as a dividend yield 2.0% 1.9% 1.9% 2.1% 2.1% Fair value per share option 221.8p 92.9p 232.5p 202.0p Monte Carlo fair value per share including probability of lapsing 124.0p The total charge for the year relating to employee share based payment plans was 5.2m 2006 5.0m, all of which related to equity-settled share based payment transactions.
