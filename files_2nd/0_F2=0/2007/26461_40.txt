This facility had not been drawn down at 31 March 2007.
Redeemable Class B shares were issued to facilitate the capital return in May 2006 see note 23.
Shareholders who elected to retain their B shares are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend based on 75 per cent of six month LIBOR on 1 June and 1 December each year until 1 June 2009 and may redeem their B shares for 200 pence each on those dates.
Any outstanding B shares will be redeemed on 1 June 2009.
NON-CURRENT BORROWINGS In July 2006 the Company issued a 250m bond which is unsecured and due for repayment in 2016, with a 5.875 per cent coupon, interest to be paid semi-annually in arrears.
The issue price of the bond was 99.679 per 100 nominal.
The coupon on the bond is dependent on the Companys credit rating.
As a result of a change in the Companys credit rating from Moodys in February 2007 from Baa1 to Baa2, the coupon will increase to 6.125 per cent from July 2007.
