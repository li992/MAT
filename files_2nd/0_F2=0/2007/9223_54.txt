The plans and the various performance conditions are discussed in more detail below.
All of the plans listed below are equity settled share-based payments.
i Annual bonus compulsory and voluntary deferral into shares For senior executives, one third of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.
For other employees, half of the gross annual bonus is delivered in shares that vest, subject to continued employment, after two years.
In respect of the annual bonus years 2004 to 2005, where a participant earned a bonus and further Group performance criteria were met, participants were invited to invest up to 25 per cent of the value of their total bonus in Ladbrokes plc shares which must then be held for three years.
The Group matched any percentage up to the 25 per cent maximum voluntarily invested by a participant.
The matching shares vest after three years, subject to continued employment and the participant continuing to hold the shares purchased by their voluntary investment.
ii Sharesave related share options scheme This is a sharesave scheme with options granted at a 20 per cent discount to market value.
The scheme operates with either a three or five years saving with vesting after this time.
iii Share incentive plan a Under the OWN Plan, employees can contribute up to 75 per month to acquire Ladbrokes plc shares.
For every two shares purchased, the Group provides a match of one additional share.
b An award of Freeshares up to 250 in value is made to participating employees on reaching one years service.

Vested options lapse if they have not been exercised within ten years of the date of grant.
All options have an EPS growth based performance condition.
v Restricted plan An award under the Restricted plan will vest in its entirety after three years.
However, employees can elect for 50 per cent of the award to vest after two years.
