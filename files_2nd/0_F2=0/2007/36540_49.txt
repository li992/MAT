notes to the aCCounts continued 20. finanCial insTrumenTs and risK managemenT Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
The groups risk management policies and practices are as follows: a. debT managemenT The group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Medium and long-term debt mainly comprises the groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
b. inTeresT raTe managemenT Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
The group has interest rate swaps of 300.0 million 2006: 300.0 million maturing in December 2008.
The swap counterparties have the option to extend the maturity of these swaps to December 2010, and thereafter to December 2016.
Under these swaps the group receives interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% and pays interest at variable rates linked to LIBOR.
In addition, the group has interest rate swaps of 28.9 million 2006: nil and 15.5 million 2006: 15.5 million maturing within the next five years.
Under these swaps the group pays interest at fixed rates of 6.275% and 4.658% respectively and receives interest linked to LIBOR.
At 31 December 2007, the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 6.4 million 2006: 8.8 million.
The group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C. foreign CurrenCY managemenT The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in France and Germany, the group has designated both euro denominated bonds and currency swaps as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2007 was 878.5 million 2006: 1,007.5 million and their fair value was 825.3 million 2006: 1,018.2 million.
At 31 December 2007 the group had currency swaps of 442.8 million, being F609.0 million sold forward against sterling: F14.8 million for value in January 2008, at a rate of 1 F1.388: and F594.2 million for value in June 2008, at a rate of 1 F1.384.
At 31 December 2006 the group had swaps of 247.8 million, being F369.2 million sold forward against sterling for value in January 2007, at a rate of 1 F1.490.
The fair value of currency swaps is detailed in note 20I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments are recognised in equity.
d. profiT and loss aCCounT and balanCe sheeT managemenT The group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover and gearing.
Management monitors the groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
e. Cash managemenT and liquidiTY Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as detailed in note 20A above.
094 Annual Report 2007 20. finanCial insTrumenTs and risK managemenT continued f. CrediT risK The groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The groups credit risk is attributable primarily to its trade and other receivables.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the groups tenant base is diversified geographically and by sector, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2007 was 10.5 years 2006: 11 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
Loans receivable and other receivables include balances due from joint venture partners, available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 15 and 16 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and tenants.

Annual Report 2007 095 section notes to the aCCounts continued 20. finanCial insTrumenTs and risK managemenT continued h. sensiTiviTY analYsis In managing interest rate and currency risks the group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2007, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the groups annual profit before tax by 22.3 million 2006: 11.7 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the groups annual profit before tax by 15.9 million 2006: 10.5 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
It is estimated that, in relation to financial instruments alone, a 1.5% strengthening of sterling against the euro, would have reduced the net loss taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2007 by 23.6 million 2006: increased net gain by 20.0 million.
A 1.5% weakening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net loss taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2007 by 24.3 million 2006: decreased net gain by 20.6 million.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at a year end foreign exchange rate changed by 1.5%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
However, the effects noted above would be more than offset by the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the financial statements of Hammerson plc.

The fair values of the groups outstanding interest rate swaps have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates.
Details of the groups cash and short-term deposits are set out in note 17.
Their fair values and those of other financial assets and liabilities equate to their book values.
Details of the groups receivables are set out in notes 15 and 16.
The amounts are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Details of the groups investments are set out in note 14.
The amounts are stated at fair value.
At 31 December 2007, the book value of financial liabilities exceeded their fair value by 91.3 million 2006: book value 90.7 million less than fair value, equivalent to 32 pence per share 2006: 32 pence per share on an adjusted net asset value per share basis.
On a post-tax basis, the difference was equivalent to 23 pence per share 2006: 22 pence per share.
