Share based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 150% of salary p. a.
Awards vest under the PSP subject to a Total Shareholder Return TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance is measured over a fixed three-year period against both the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts the Index and a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Half of an award is tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three-years from the date of grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid to participants over the vesting period.
Further details in relation to the PSP award measurements are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.

2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The only share option scheme operated by the Company during the year was the 2000 ESOS.
Options granted under the 2000 ESOS normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of the grant if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against the Index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the Index over the three-year period following grant.
Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three-year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS.
Options granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the IFRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 Share Based Payments.

UK & Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all employee plans, which have been set up in both the UK and Ireland, that enable employees to make contributions out of salary up to prescribed limits each month, which are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow shares Partnership Shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to the trustees to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
The SIPs have a three month accumulation period.
The fair value of a Matching Share is the market value at grant adjusted for any options included.
For this purpose, the grant date is the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date.
For the Irish plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date.
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Group recognised a total expense of 126,000 2006: 55,000 for the matching shares and 9,000 2006: 7,000 for the partnership shares.
