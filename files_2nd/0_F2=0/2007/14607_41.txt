On acquisition, the Group paid off LCHs finance lease obligations and included the indebtedness within its existing banking facilities.
LCH operates six depots in the UK, supplying generators for hire to construction and industrial services customers on a nationwide basis.
The initial fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are as follows: Accounting Book value at policy Fair value acquisition alignment adjustment Fair value m m m m Intangible assets 14.4 14.4 Hire equipment assets 20.4 0.8 19.6 Other property, plant and equipment 2.6 0.6 2.0 Inventory 2.0 2.0 Trade and other receivables 5.4 0.1 5.3 Corporation tax 0.5 0.5 Trade and other payables 9.0 9.0 Deferred tax 2.1 4.3 6.4 19.8 0.8 9.4 28.4 Goodwill capitalised 26.2 Total consideration 54.6 Satisfied by: cash consideration 36.7 debt assumed on acquisition 13.1 shares issued 4.4 costs of acquisition 0.4 54.6 Speedy Hire Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007 71 13481 05 06 2007 Proof 8 13481SPEEDYHI.
qxd:13481SPEEDYHI 5 6 07 14:01 Page 72 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2007 21 Acquisitions continued An independent valuation to identify and determine the value of any intangible assets has been performed following the acquisition.
Separable intangible assets have been identified in respect of the businesss customer list 12m and brand 2.4m.
The customer list intangible has been valued using the excess earnings method, and is based on income forecast to be generated over the next ten years.
The valuation assumes that the customer attrition rate will be 12.4% per annum, based on management estimates and historical rates recorded by the company.
Capital asset charges have been applied using risk-adjusted weighted average costs of capital in respect of fixed assets, working capital and the workforce.
Other assumptions used in the valuation include an assumed growth in income from customers of 2.1% per annum, and a discount rate applied to the resulting income stream of 12%.
The customer list intangible is being amortised over ten years, which is considered to be the period over which the majority of the benefits are expected to arise.
The brand intangible has been valued using the relief-from-royalty method, using a royalty rate of 1% of income for a ten year period, discounted at a rate of 13%.
Whilst the Directors consider that the acquired brand is capable of supporting a longer life, the intangible is being amortised over a period of four years, which is estimated to be the useful life within the business.
Goodwill arising on both acquisitions completed during the year is attributed to the additional profitability created through access to new and extended markets and from operating efficiencies expected to be generated in the existing business.
Lifting Gear Hire Limited Lifting Gear The Group acquired the entire share capital of Lifting Gear on 30 October 2006.
The company is a specialist provider for the hire of lifting equipment and associated services including the repair, maintenance, testing and inspection of lifting equipment.

Lifting Gear operates from 34 depots in the UK.

The accounting policy adjustments on both acquisitions relate primarily to aligning the accounting policies in respect of depreciation.
The fair value adjustments relate to the recognition of intangible assets in respect of customer lists and the brands, and the revaluation of certain property, plant and equipment which was sold shortly after acquisition, together with the related deferred taxation.
Acquisitions completed in the prior year were as follows: Caledonian Safemaker restated On 3 February 2006, the Group completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of GW1147 Limited, the Caledonian Safemaker hire business.

The brand intangible has been valued using an estimated royalty rate of 1%, discounted at a rate of 17%.
