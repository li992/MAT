Risk Management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives as stated on page 19.
In pursuing its investment objectives, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
These risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close cooperation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to manage the risks, that are set out below, have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 19 ii, interest rate risk see note 19 iii and other price risk see note 19 iv.
The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing these risks, which have remained substantially unchanged from those applying in the year ended 31 December 2006.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
ii Currency risk A large proportion of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency, and in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates can significantly affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
Foreign currency borrowing facilities are available to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure An analysis of the foreign currency exposure of the Companys equity investments at 31 December is given below.
There were no monetary items denominated in foreign currency at the balance sheet date.
USD CAD AUD Rand Other 000 000 000 000 000 Investments at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 2007 329,847 130,131 148,002 106,962 127,948 2006 170,111 130,433 120,760 79,543 89,431 The above amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year as levels of monetary foreign currency exposure change significantly throughout the year.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued ii Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year to exchange rates for the US Dollar, CA Dollar, AU Dollar and Rand.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: USD -5% 2006: 10% CAD -20% 2006: 10% AUD -10% 2006: 5% Rand -10% 2006: 20% These percentages have been determined based on market volatility in exchange rates over the previous 12 months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
If sterling had weakened against the currencies below this would have the following effect: 2007 2006 USD CAD AUD Rand USD CAD AUD Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Impact on revenue return 383 332 1,192 422 460 94 146 104 Impact on capital return 17,360 32,533 16,455 11,885 18,901 14,493 6,356 19,886 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 17,743 32,865 17,647 12,307 19,361 14,587 6,502 19,990 If sterling had strengthened against the currencies below this would have the following effect: 2007 2006 USD CAD AUD Rand USD CAD AUD Rand 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Impact on revenue return 114 54 482 150 376 77 132 69 Impact on capital return 15,707 21,689 13,455 9,724 15,465 11,858 5,750 13,257 Total return after tax effect on shareholders funds 15,821 21,743 13,937 9,874 15,841 11,935 5,882 13,326 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses are not representative of the year as a whole, since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued iii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect: the fair value of investments of fixed interest securities the level of income receivable from fixed interest securities and cash at bank and on deposit the interest payable on the Companys variable rate borrowings Management of the risk The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and borrowing under the multi-currency loan facility.
In the year to 31 December 2007, the Company held no fixed interest securities.
The Company, generally, does not hold significant cash balances, with short term borrowings being used when required.
Interest rate exposure The exposure at 31 December of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates when the interest rate is due to be re-set fixed interest rates when the financial instrument is due for repayment 2007 2006 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Bank overdrafts 543 543 8,156 8,156 Exposure to fixed interest rates: Investments at fair value through profit or loss 766 766 Total exposure to interest rates 543 543 8,156 766 7,390 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure changes as investments are made in fixed interest securities, borrowings are drawn down and repaid, and the mix of borrowings between floating and fixed interest rate changes.
The Company has little exposure to interest rates as the majority of financial assets are equity shares which do not pay interest.
Therefore the Companys total income and equity, is not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
In the year to 31 December 2007, the Company held no fixed rate securities and therefore was only exposed to interest rate risk on bank borrowings.
The Companys maximum interest rate exposure during 2007 was 74,781,000 2006: 31,178,000 relating to current liabilities.
Interest receivable, and finance costs are at the following rates: Interest received on cash balances, or paid on bank overdrafts respectively, is approximate to 5.29% and 6.42% per annum 2006: 4.38% and 4.59% per annum.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued iv Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the investments.
Management of the risk The Board of Directors manage the risks inherent in the investment portfolios by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance.
The Board monitors the Investment Managers compliance with the Companys objectives, and is directly responsible for investment strategy and asset allocation.
When appropriate, the Company manages its exposure to risk by buying selling put or call options on equity or commodity investments in its portfolio.
The Companys exposure to other changes in market prices at 31 December on its quoted and unquoted equity or commodity investments and options on indices and investments was 1,272,222,000 2006: 881,566,000.
Concentration of exposure to other price risks An analysis of the Companys investment portfolio is shown on pages 14 to 16.
This shows the majority of the investments value is in global companies, with significant amounts also in Latin America, South Africa, Australia and in the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to those countries, though it is recognised that an investments country of domicile or of listing does not necessarily equate to its exposure to the economic conditions in that country.
Other price risk sensitivity The following illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after taxation for the year and the equity to an increase or decrease of 20% in the fair values of the Companys equities including equity exposure through options.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in 2007.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and equity exposure through options at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.
The impact of a 20% increase in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2007 is a decrease of 1,544,000 2006: 301,000 and on the capital return is an increase of 253,343,000 2006: 173,592,000.
The impact of a 20% fall in the value of investments on the revenue return as at 31 December 2007 is an increase of 1,544,000 2006: 301,000 and on the capital return is a decrease of 253,343,000 2006: 173,592,000.

Risk Management policies and procedures continued v Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Company has an overdraft facility of 40 million 2006: 40 million and a multicurrency loan facility of 60 million 2006: nil.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amount of the Companys resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Company should remain at least 75% invested in normal market conditions, 25% of the Companys assets may be invested in cash and cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
Liquidity risk exposure The remaining contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at 31 December, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required, were as follows: Not more 3 months than one More than or less year one year Total 2007 000 000 000 000 Current liabilities: Borrowings under the multi-currency loan facility Bank overdrafts 543 543 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 4,446 789 5,235 4,989 789 5,778 2006 Current liabilities: Bank overdrafts 8,156 8,156 Amounts due to brokers and accruals 3,129 3,153 6,282 11,285 3,153 14,438 54 Merrill Lynch World Mining Trust plc 19.
Risk Management policies and procedures continued vi Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of the risk The risk is not significant, and is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond, corporate or otherwise, the credit rating of the issuer is taken into account so as to determine the risk to the Company of default: transactions involving derivatives are either exchange traded where the relevant exchange guarantees settlement or on an over the counter basis.
Transactions are entered into only with those counterparties approved by the credit department of the Investment Manager.
Counterparties are selected on the basis of a number of risk mitigation criteria designed to reduce the risk to the Company of default: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers, whose credit-standard is reviewed periodically by the Investment Manager, and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker: cash at bank is held only with banks with high quality external credit ratings: stock lending is entered into only with reputable counterparties and with secured collateral to 105% of the value of stock on loan.
In summary, the exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: 2007 2006 Balance Balance Sheet Sheet 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,266,714 867,959 Current assets: Financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss derivatives put call options 5,508 13,607 Other receivables amounts due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable 1,772 1,558 Cash at bank and on deposit None of the Companys financial liabilities are past due or impaired.
vii Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The fair values of the financial assets and financial liabilities, are either carried in the Balance Sheet at their fair value investments and derivatives or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value due from brokers, dividends and interest receivable, due to brokers, accruals, cash at bank, bank overdrafts and amounts due under the multicurrency loan facility.
