Discontinued operations Discontinued operations relate to the following disposals made in the year see note 31 : Government Solutions sold 15 February 2007 Datamark acquired with eCollege and subsequently sold on 31 July 2007 Les Echos sold 24 December 2007 The results of Government Solutions previously included in the Professional segment and Les Echos previously included in the FT Publishing segment have been included in discontinued operations for both 2006 and 2007 and have been consolidated up to the date of sale.
Datamark was sold immediately following its acquisition as part of the eCollege transaction and consequently none of the results for this business have been consolidated.
On 22 February 2008 the Group completed the sale of its Data Management business previously included in the Professional segment and this business has been included in discontinued operations for the full year in both 2006 and 2007.
In anticipation of the loss on sale, an impairment to held for sale goodwill has been charged to the income statement in 2007.

Earnings per share Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares to take account of all dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusting the profit attributable, if applicable, to account for any tax consequences that might arise from conversion of those shares.

The Companys definition of adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
The following items are excluded in the calculation of adjusted earnings: Amortisation of acquired intangibles is the amortisation of intangible assets acquired through business combinations.
The amortisation charge is not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying performance of the Group.
Other net gains and losses represent profits and losses on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and other financial assets that are included within continuing or discontinued operations but which distort the performance of the Group.
Other net finance income costs are foreign exchange and other gains and losses that represent short-term fluctuations in market value and foreign exchange movements on transactions and balances that are no longer in a hedge relationship.
These gains and losses are subject to significant volatility and may not be realised in due course as it is normally the intention to hold these instruments to maturity.
Other net finance costs of Group companies are included in finance costs or finance income as appropriate.
Other net finance costs of joint ventures and associates are included within the share of results of joint ventures and associates within operating profit.
Tax on the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.
From 2007 the Group has also added the benefit of tax amortisation of goodwill and intangibles as this benefit more accurately aligns the adjusted tax charge with the expected medium-term rate of cash tax payments.
The 2006 comparative has been restated accordingly.
In 2006, the Company excluded tax benefits from the recognition of its tax losses which due to their size and non-recurring nature were not considered to be fully reflective of the underlying tax rate of the Group.
Minority interest for the above items is excluded from adjusted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Impairment tests have been carried out where appropriate as described below.
The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units identified according to the business segment.
Goodwill has been allocated as follows: All figures in millions Notes 2007 2006 Higher Education 1,031 780 School Curriculum 2006: School Book 867 683 School Assessment and Information 2006: School Assessment and Testing 540 342 School Technology 356 Other Assessment and Testing 247 490 Technology and Business Publishing 2006: Other Book 55 56 Pearson Education total 2,740 2,707 Penguin US 155 156 Penguin UK 111 114 Pearson Australia 52 44 Penguin total 318 314 Financial Times 12 4 Mergermarket 126 97 Interactive Data 147 149 FT Group total 285 250 Total goodwill continuing operations 3,343 3,271 Goodwill held for sale 30 96 221 Total goodwill 3,439 3,492 Goodwill has been allocated for impairment purposes to 11 cash-generating units CGUs.
During 2007, three CGUs, School Book, School Assessment and Testing and Other Book were renamed following the reorganisation of the School segment.
The reorganisation resulted in the School Technology CGU being allocated between School Assessment and Information formerly School Assessment and Testing and School Curriculum formerly School Book.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific cash-generating unit.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.5% to 12.0% for the Pearson Education businesses, 8.9% to 11.7% for the Penguin businesses and 10.4% to 17.2% for the FT Group businesses.
Perpetuity growth rates The cash flows subsequent to the approved budget period are based upon the long-term historic growth rates of the underlying territories in which the CGU operates and reflect the long-term growth prospects of the sectors in which the CGU operates.
The perpetuity growth rates used vary between 2.5% and 3.5%.
The perpetuity growth rates are consistent with appropriate external sources for the relevant markets.
Cash flow growth rates The cash flow growth rates are derived from forecast sales growth taking into consideration past experience of operating margins achieved in the cash-generating unit.
Historically, such forecasts have been reasonably accurate.
Sensitivities The Groups impairment review is sensitive to a change in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and the perpetuity rates.
Based on the Groups sensitivity analysis, a reasonable possible change in a single factor will not cause impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
However, a significant adverse change in our key assumptions could result in an impairment in our School Curriculum and or Penguin UK CGUs as their fair value currently exceeds their carrying value only by between 10% and 20%.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities may be offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The Group has unrecognised deferred income tax assets at 31 December 2007 in respect of UK losses of 34m 2006: 35m.
None of these unrecognised deferred income tax assets have expiry dates associated with them.

None of these derivatives are held for speculative trading purposes.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are only undertaken to manage risks arising from underlying business activity, in accordance with the Groups treasury policy see page 22.
The Group designates certain qualifying derivative financial instruments as hedges of the fair value of its bonds fair value hedges.
Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in the income statement, together with any change in the fair value of the hedged liability attributable to the hedged risk.
The Group also designates certain of its borrowings and derivative financial instruments as hedges of its investments in foreign operations net investment hedges.
Movements in the fair value of these financial instruments to the extent they are effective are recognised in equity.
None of the Groups financial assets or liabilities are designated at fair value through the profit & loss account upon initial recognition.
More detail on the Groups accounting for financial instruments is included in the Groups accounting policies on page 57.
The maturity of contracted cash flows on the Groups borrowings and all of its derivative financial instruments are as follows: 2007 All figures in millions USD GBP EUR Total Not later than one year 153 30 123 Later than one year and not later than five years 966 70 1,036 Later than five years 420 285 705 Total 1,539 325 1,864 Analysed as: Revolving credit facilities and commercial paper 429 429 Bonds 1,017 483 1,500 Rate derivatives inflows 268 160 428 Rate derivatives outflows 361 2 363 Total 1,539 325 1,864 74 Pearson Annual Report and Accounts 2007 14.

Any cash flows based on a floating rate are calculated using interest rates as set at the date of the last rate reset.
Where this is not possible, floating rates are based on interest rates prevailing at 31 December in the relevant year.
All derivative amounts are shown gross, although the company net settles these amounts wherever possible.
Amounts drawn under revolving credit facilities and commercial paper are assumed to mature at the maturity date of the relevant facility, with interest calculated as payable in each calendar year up to and including the date of maturity of the facility.

Fair values are determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
At the end of 2007, the currency split of the mark-to-market values of rate derivatives, including the exchange of principal on cross currency rate derivatives, was US dollar 119 m, and sterling 154m 2006: US dollar 247 m, euro 157m and sterling 157m.
The fixed interest rates on outstanding rate derivative contracts at the end of 2007 range from 4.45% to 7.00% 2006: 3.02% to 7.00% and the floating rates are based on LIBOR in US dollar and sterling.
75 Pearson Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 16.
Derivative financial instruments continued The Groups portfolio of rate derivatives is diversified by maturity, counterparty and type.
Natural offsets between transactions within the portfolio and the designation of certain derivatives as hedges significantly reduce the risk of income statement volatility.
Counterparty exposure from all derivatives is managed, together with that from deposits and bank account balances, within credit limits that reflect published credit ratings to ensure that there is no significant risk to any one counterparty.
No single derivative transaction had a market value positive or negative at the balance sheet date that exceeded 3% of the Groups consolidated total equity.
At the end of 2006, the Group held an amount of 29m as collateral under a mark-to-market agreement.
This reflected the amount, at market rates prevailing at the end of October 2006, owed to the Group by a counterparty for a set of three related rate derivatives.
The amount was settled at the beginning of February 2007, along with repayment of the 591m bond.
In accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the Group has reviewed all of its material contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements, and has concluded that there are no material embedded derivatives.

Retirement benefit and other post-retirement obligations Background The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans throughout the world.
For the defined benefit plans, benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
Defined contribution benefits are based on the amount of contributions paid in respect of an individual member, the investment returns earned and the amount of pension this money will buy when a member retires.
The largest plan is the Pearson Group Pension Plan UK Group plan with both defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
From 1 November 2006, all sections of the UK Group plan were closed to new members with the exception of a defined contribution section that was opened in 2003.
This section is available to all new employees of participating companies.
The other major defined benefit plans are based in the US.
Other defined contribution plans are operated principally overseas with the largest plan being in the US.
The specific features of these plans vary in accordance with the regulations of the country in which employees are located.
Pearson also has several post-retirement medical benefit plans PRMBs, principally in the US.
PRMBs are unfunded but are accounted for and valued similarly to defined benefit pension plans.
Assumptions The principal assumptions used for the UK Group plan and the US PRMB are shown below.
Weighted average assumptions have been shown for the other plans, which primarily relate to US pension plans.

The US discount rate is set by reference to a US bond portfolio matching model.
The expected return on assets is based on market expectations of long-term asset returns for the defined portfolio at the end of the year.
The expected rates of return on categories of plan assets are determined by reference to relevant indices.
The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance in the plans investment portfolio.
The UK mortality assumptions have been derived by adjusting standard mortality tables PMFA 92 tables projected forward with medium cohort improvement factors.
The Group changed its mortality assumptions in the UK in 2007 to reflect an assumed increased life expectancy of pensioners by adding a 1% floor to the medium cohort projections.
For the US plans, the assumptions used were based on standard US mortality tables GAM94.
Using the above tables, the remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65 on the balance sheet date for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2007 2006 2007 2006 Male 21.3 20.9 17.9 17.9 Female 21.6 21.3 21.3 21.3 The remaining average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 65, 20 years after the balance sheet date, for the UK and US Group plans is as follows: UK US 2007 2006 2007 2006 Male 23.1 22.2 17.9 17.9 Female 23.6 22.5 21.3 21.3 81 Pearson Annual Report and Accounts 2007 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 24.

The trustees of the plan are required to act in the best interest of the plans beneficiaries.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation for funding purposes was completed as at 1 January 2006 and revealed a funding shortfall.
The Group has agreed that the funding shortfall will be eliminated by 31 December 2014.
In 2007 the Group contributed 121m including a special contribution of 100m and has agreed to contribute 21m in 2008 and 21.9m per annum thereafter in excess of an estimated 30m of regular contributions.
The Group expects to contribute $70m in 2008 and $73m in 2009 to its US pension plans.
Sensitivities The net retirement benefit obligations are calculated using a number of assumptions, the most significant being the discount rate used to calculate the defined benefit obligation.
The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rate on the defined benefit obligation and the total pension expense is as follows: 2007 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation UK Group plan 222 275 Decrease increase of aggregate of service cost and interest cost UK Group plan 4.6 5.8 Decrease increase in defined benefit obligation US plan 6.7 7.3 The effect of a one percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed medical cost trend rates is as follows: 2007 All figures in millions 1% increase 1% decrease Effect on: Decrease increase in post-retirement medical benefit obligation 3.7 4.1 Increase decrease of aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.1 0.1 25.

In 1998, the Group introduced a Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.
Under these plans, employees can save a portion of their monthly salary over periods of three, five or seven years.
At the end of this period, the employee has the option to purchase ordinary shares with the accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 80% of the market price prevailing at the time of the commencement of the employees participation in the plan.
Options that are not exercised within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary after grant lapse unconditionally.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan In 2000, the Group established an Employee Stock Purchase Plan which allows all employees in the US to save a portion of their monthly salary over six month periods.
At the end of the period, the employee has the option to purchase ADRs with their accumulated funds at a purchase price equal to 85% of the lower of the market price prevailing at the beginning or end of the period.

Share-based payments continued Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and renewed in 2006 and consists of two parts: share options and or restricted shares.
Options were granted under this plan in 2001 based on a pre-grant earnings per share growth test and are not subject to further performance conditions on exercise.
The options became exercisable in tranches and lapse if they remain unexercised at the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
The vesting of restricted shares is normally dependent on continuing service and or upon the satisfaction of corporate performance targets over a three-year period.
These targets may be based on market and or non-market performance criteria.
Restricted shares awarded to senior management in October 2006 and July 2007 vest dependent on relative shareholder return, return on invested capital and earnings per share growth.
The award was split equally across all three measures.
Other restricted shares awarded in 2006 and 2007 vest depending on continuing service over a three-year period.
Annual Bonus Share Matching Plan This plan permits executive directors and senior executives around the Group to invest up to 50% of any after tax annual bonus in Pearson shares.
If these shares are held and the Group meets an earnings per share growth target, the Company will match them on a gross basis of up to one share for every one held.
In addition to the above, share options remain outstanding under Executive Share Option, Reward and Special Share Option Plans.
These are legacy plans which were replaced with the introduction of the Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2001.
The number and weighted average exercise prices of share options granted under the Groups plans are as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share exercise share exercise options price options price 000s 000s Outstanding at beginning of year 18,861 13.36 21,677 13.15 Granted during the year 773 6.90 837 6.30 Exercised during the year 1,326 5.80 1,396 5.36 Forfeited during the year 1,434 19.63 1,828 15.39 Expired during the year 93 7.68 429 6.72 Outstanding at end of year 16,781 13.15 18,861 13.36 Options exercisable at end of year 13,999 14.63 15,595 14.14 Options were exercised regularly throughout the year.
The weighted average share price during the year was 8.02 2006: 7.45.
Early exercises arising from redundancy, retirement or death are treated as an acceleration of vesting and the Group therefore recognises in the income statement the amount that otherwise would have been recognised for services received over the remainder of the original vesting period.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have weighted average remaining contractual lives and exercise prices as follows: 2007 2006 Weighted Weighted Number of average Number of average share contractual share contractual Range of exercise prices options life options life 000s Years 000s Years 0 5 930 1.56 1,649 1.94 5 10 4,909 3.22 5,254 3.85 10 15 7,257 2.62 7,638 3.63 15 20 980 1.85 1,050 2.88 20 25 400 2.19 424 3.19 25 2,305 2.19 2,846 3.22 16,781 2.62 18,861 3.42 In 2007 and 2006 options were granted under the Worldwide Save for Shares Plan.

The fair value of shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan that vest unconditionally is determined using the share price at the date of grant.
Participants of the Long-Term Incentive Plan are entitled to dividends during the vesting period.
The number of shares to vest has been adjusted, based on historical experience, to account for any potential forfeitures.
Restricted shares with a market performance condition were valued by an independent actuary using a Monte Carlo model.
Restricted shares with a non-market performance condition were fair valued based on the share price at the date of grant.
Non-market performance conditions were considered by adjusting the number of shares expected to vest based on the most likely outcome of the relevant performance criteria.
Subsidiary share option plans Interactive Data, a 62% subsidiary of the Group, operates the following share-based payment plans: 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan The 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan allows all eligible employees worldwide to purchase stock at a discounted price at specific times.
2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan Under this plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors can grant share-based awards representing up to 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding at the date of grant.
The plan provides for the discretionary issuance of share-based awards to directors, officers and employees of Interactive Data, as well as persons who provide consulting or other services to Interactive Data.
The exercise price for all options granted to date has been equal to the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
Options expire ten years from the date of grant and generally vest over a three to four year period without any performance criteria attached.
In addition, grants of restricted stock can be made to certain executives and members of the Board of Directors of Interactive Data.
The awarded shares are available for distribution, at no cost, at the end of a three-year vesting period.
No performance criteria are attached to shares granted under this plan.
Interactive Data employees purchased 186,343 shares 2006: 206,324 under the 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan at an average share price of $17.77 8.93 2006: $15.58: 7.96.
