Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 11 March 2008.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of The Companies Act 1985.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounting policies which follow set out those policies which have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.
These financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
"In preparing these financial statements the Group has applied IAS40 ""Investment Property"", IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IAS1 Amendment to IAS1: Capital Disclosures."
Following the disposal of Weir Pumps, a property held by the company now meets the denition of investment property.
The application of IAS40 resulted in a reclassication, amounting to 4.8m, from property, plant & equipment to investment property in the balance sheet.
The directors have chosen to apply the cost model within IAS40, therefore there has been no adjustment necessary to the measurement basis of the property and as such there is no other impact from the adoption of this accounting policy, which is detailed below, in these financial statements.
The adoption of IFRS7 resulted in the Group disclosing additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to including greater detail on the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure.
The adoption of the IAS1 amendment resulted in the Group disclosing additional information about its capital structure.
There has been no effect on reported income or net assets from the adoption of IFRS7 or the IAS1 amendment.
The format of the consolidated income statement presented in these consolidated financial statements differs from that used in the Groups consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006 and the Groups 2007 Interim Report.
The format of the consolidated income statement included within these consolidated financial statements, which now presents intangibles amortisation in a separate column with exceptional items, has been adopted as it presents information in a format that is more relevant to users of the financial statements by improving the visibility of the impact that increased acquisition activity has had on intangible assets.
In addition, the analysis of expenses has been transferred from the face of the income statement to the notes to the financial statements in order to present the key performance indicators more clearly to users of the financial statements.
The comparative information has been reclassied accordingly, resulting in the reclassication of intangibles amortisation of 2.3m.
The format of the consolidated cash ow statement presented in these financial statements differs from that used in the Group's consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006.
The format of the consolidated cash ow statement included within these financial statements, which presents cash ows for continuing operations only, has been adopted as it presents information in a format that is more relevant to users of the financial statements.
The comparative information has been restated accordingly, resulting in 22.9m of cash inows from operating activities and 2.7m of cash outows from investing activities being reclassied as relating to discontinued operations.
Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described on page 21.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash ows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group, and the Groups share of its joint ventures and associates results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Minority interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
52 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 Joint ventures & associates The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
An associate is an entity over which the Company, either directly or indirectly, is in a position to exercise significant inuence by participating in, but not controlling or jointly controlling, the financial and operating policies of the entity.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture or associate, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint venture or associates identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint venture or associates identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint venture or associates profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the cash ow statement, the cash ows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
A construction contract is dened as a contract that is specically negotiated for the construction of an asset or a combination of assets that are closely interrelated or interdependent in terms of their design, technology and function or their ultimate purpose or use.
Where the time taken to complete such contracts extends over different accounting periods, revenue is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Exceptional items Material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period, are presented as exceptional items on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
Goodwill Business combinations on or after 27 December 2003 are accounted for under IFRS3 using the purchase method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 53 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benets and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a nite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost which, in respect of an acquired intangible asset, represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life.
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are as follows Brand names - indefinite life Customer relationships - 10 - 25 years Purchased software - 4 - 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years Other - up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benets are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Investment property The Group has one property which is currently being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services and as such this property is classied as investment property.
Investment property is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classied as finance leases.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
54 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash ows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash ows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Trade & other receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand, other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less, bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outow of economic benets will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Derecognition of financial assets & liabilities The Group's principal financial assets and liabilities comprise bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits as well as financial derivatives.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset or liability is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modied, such an exchange or modication is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 55 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued Financial instruments a Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of cross currency swap contracts is calculated by reference to market values.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classied as fair value hedges, cash ow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classied as a cash ow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in equity rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in equity will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
b Embedded derivatives Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
Post-employment benets Post-employment benets comprise pension benets provided to employees throughout the world and other benets, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For dened benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benets are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benets have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For dened contribution plans, the cost represents the Groups contributions to the plans and this is charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups executive share option scheme, the savings-related share option scheme and the Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of these schemes that is based on the fair value of the awards.
For equity settled schemes, the fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently remeasured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modied.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or non-market performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
56 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised, on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions.
a Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised.
b Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
c A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
New standards & interpretations The IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date for periods commencing IFRS2 Amendment to IFRS2 Share Based Payment: Vesting Conditions and Cancellations 1 January 2009 IFRS3 Revised IFRS3 Business Combinations 1 July 2009 IFRS8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IAS1 Amendments to IAS1 Presentation of Financial Statements: A Revised Presentation 1 January 2009 IAS23 Amendments to IAS23 Borrowing Costs 1 January 2009 IAS27 Amendments to IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements 1 July 2009 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 March 2007 IFRIC12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 IFRIC13 Customer Loyalty Programmes 1 July 2008 IFRIC14 The Limit on a Dened benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements 1 January 2008 and their Interaction not yet adopted for use in the European Union The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
IAS23 requires borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of certain assets to be capitalised.
The option currently taken by the Group of charging such costs to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred will no longer be available prospectively from 1 January 2009.
IFRS3 will apply to business combinations arising from 1 January 2010.
This will require recognition of subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration in the income statement rather than against goodwill.
In addition, transaction costs will be required to be recognised immediately in the income statement.

Segment information The Groups primary reporting format is business segments, as the Groups risks and rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
The Groups secondary format is geographical segments.
The operating businesses are organised and managed separately according to the nature of the products and services provided, with each segment representing a strategic business unit that offers different products and serves different markets.
The Engineering Products segment comprises the manufacture of pumps and valves for ow control applications.
The Engineering Services segment provides equipment maintenance, process support and asset management services.
The Defence, Nuclear & Gas segment comprises the defence and liquid gas handling businesses which provide specialist design and project management of complex engineering contracts.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.
The Groups geographical segments are determined by the location of the Groups assets and operations.
Business segments The following tables present revenue and profit information and certain asset and liability information on the Groups continuing operations for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2007 and 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006 analysed by business segment.

The results of Multio were not significant.
The combined revenue and profit of the Group, assuming that SPM Flow Control, Inc. and Multio had been acquired at the start of 2007, would have been 1164.9m and 98.5m respectively.
On 16 February 2006, the Group acquired the business and certain trading assets of Loftyman Engineering Limited, a company registered in Hong Kong.
The amount payable for the goodwill associated with the business was 0.8m and a total of 0.4m was payable for the trading assets.
Included in the 178.1m of goodwill recognised above are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.

The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that these might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGU are determined from value in use calculations using cash ow forecasts based on the latest strategic five year plan projections approved by the Board.
These projections are based on historical performance and the most recent financial forecasts available.
The main assumptions used in the value in use calculations relate to selling price, sales volume and cost increases.
The strategic five year plans of each CGU incorporate third-party demand projections for the specic market segments which they serve.
These market demand projections contain both volume and pricing assumptions but generally the pricing assumption assumes growth in line with ination.
Beyond sales volume effects, operating cost increases are projected in line with long-run ination expectations for the relevant territory that the CGU operates in.
Cash ows beyond the period of the projections are extrapolated based on expected growth rates for the geographical area.
The growth rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rates for these areas.
Weighted average growth rates used were 2.6% for Weir SPM, 2.9% 2006: 2.9% for the Warman companies, 2.0% 2006: 2.0% for Weir Gabbioneta and 2.8% 2006: 2.6% for Other.
The discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are based on the weighted average, nominal, risk adjusted pre-tax cost of capital in the various geographical regions.
The weighted average discount rates used were 14.8% for Weir SPM, 15.5% 2006: 14.8% for the Warman companies, 14.3% 2006: 13.6% for Weir Gabbioneta and 14.0% 2006: 13.5% for Other.
In assessing the value in use of the CGUs, management have considered the potential impact of reasonably possible changes in the main assumptions usedand believe that there are no such changes that would cause the carrying value of the units to exceed their recoverable amounts.

Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 8.2m 2006: 9.5m and deductible temporary differences of 4.0m 2006: 2.4m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 16.1m 2006: 17.6m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 77 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 23.
Deferred tax continued Temporary differences associated with Group investments The Group has determined that the unremitted earnings of the South American subsidiaries will be distributed in the foreseeable future and accordingly, a deferred tax liability of 9.1m 2006: 7.6m has been recognised in respect of taxes arising from such a distribution.
As at 28 December 2007, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to 465.8m 2006: 211.3m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans The Group has six dened benefit pension plans in the UK and North America, all of which, with the exception of the main UK plan, are final salary pension plans.
With effect from 23 November 2006, contribution salary in respect of the Groups main UK plan will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum.
The most significant of the dened benefit plans are the two UK plans and the Canadian plan.
All dened benefit plans are closed to new members.
For these closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the plan approach retirement.
The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benets to senior employees in the United States.

Equity settled share-based payments LTIP Three types of award may be made under the LTIP to senior executives: performance shares, matching shares and investment shares.
All awards vest over a three year period.
Performance shares Performance shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares subject to Group performance.
In 2007, conditional awards of performance shares were made worth 70% 2006: 70% of salary to the chief executive, 45% 2006: 100% of salary to the Group finance director and 80% 2006: 45% to the legal and commercial director.
Other conditional awards of performance shares made in 2007 were 40% 2006: 40% of salary to other senior executives who participate in the matching shares awards, and 25% 2006: 25% of salary to other senior executives who do not participate in that plan.
At the 2008 annual general meeting of the Company, shareholder approval will be sought to amend the terms of the LTIP to i increase the annual limit on performance shares from 80% of salary to 100% of salary and ii provide exibility to increase such limit to 150% of salary in such circumstances as the Remuneration Committee determine exceptional currently the exceptional limit is restricted for use in connection with recruitment.
The changes are being proposed following the Remuneration Committee concluding that the current annual limits constrain the Companys ability to make market competitive performance share awards.
No other changes to the terms of the LTIP are envisaged.
Matching & investment shares Matching shares are conditional awards to acquire free shares, subject to Group performance.
The chief executive, other executive directors and senior executives are required to compulsorily defer an element of any Group bonus earned for the preceding financial year in exchange for which they are awarded investment shares.
They are also allowed to voluntarily invest the balance of the Group bonus subject to any cap imposed by the Remuneration Committee, currently 20% in shares.
In return, they receive a conditional award of matching shares worth a maximum of 2.5 times the pre-tax value of the bonus invested.
The value of shares for this purpose will be the average published closing price of a share for the three dealing days immediately preceding the date of grant of the award of shares.
The conditional awards of performance shares and matching shares only vest if a highly demanding performance condition is achieved.
For awards granted in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, the performance condition is based on the growth in the Companys Total Shareholder Return TSR over a single three year performance period three consecutive financial years beginning with the year in which the grant is made relative to the growth in the TSR of a comparator group, to comprise the following 20 companies: AGA Foodservice Group, Bodycote International, Cookson Group, Domnick Hunter Group, Enodis, FKI, Halma, IMI, Kidde, Meggitt, Mitie Group, Morgan Crucible Company, Rolls-Royce, Rotork, Senior, Smiths Group, Spirax-Sarco Engineering, Tomkins, Wood Group and WS Atkins, except that Domnick Hunter Group and Kidde were not included in the comparator group for the 2006 and 2007 awards as they were fide-listed from the London Stock Exchange in December 2005 and April 2005 respectively.
Only if the Companys TSR ranks in the upper quintile of this group will the full awards vest.
This reduces on a sliding scale so that for median performance, 25% of the awards will vest.
For below median performance, none of the awards will vest.
In addition to TSR performance, for any of the performance and matching shares to vest, the growth in the Companys earnings per share over the performance period must be equal to or greater than the growth in the UK Retail Price Index over the same period.

Equity settled share-based payments continued Share option schemes The Company operated a discretionary executive share option scheme the Executive Scheme under which options could be granted to those senior executives of the Group whose skills and experience the Remuneration Committee believed to be important to the success of the Group.
The Executive Scheme, which was approved in 1994, expired in May 2004.
Under the rules of the Scheme, share options could be granted up to a maximum value of four times a participants earnings.
Options were granted at the mid market price of the share at the date of grant.
The right to exercise an Executive Scheme option is subject to performance conditions as determined by the Committee at the date of grant.
The performance criteria applicable for the options granted after 2000 were for the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share over a three year period, to either exceed by nine percent the growth in the retail price index of the UK over that three year period, or exceed the weighted average growth during that three year period of the normalised earnings per share of those companies in the FTSE All Share Industrial Engineering sector.
This is re-tested every year from the third anniversary of the grant of the option to the date the option lapses.
In addition, the Company operated a savings-related share option scheme in the UK which was not subject to performance criteria.
This scheme was closed in 2004.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of share options.

Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives & policies The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings, loans, cash and short-term deposits as well as financial derivatives.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, commodity price, credit, liquidity and interest rate.
These risks are managed in accordance with Board approved policies.
Foreign currency risk The Group has invested in operations outside the United Kingdom and also buys and sells goods and services in currencies other than in the functional currency of its subsidiary operations.
As a result, the Group's non sterling revenues, profits, assets, liabilities and cash ows can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
Foreign currency risks may exist in respect of financial instruments which are denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency of the Groups subsidiary operations and which are of a monetary nature.
The Group seeks to minimise these risks by ensuring that major non-derivative monetary financial instruments receivables, payables, cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings are either directly denominated in the functional currency of the Groups subsidiary operations or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of these financial instruments therefore have no significant effects on profit or loss or shareholders equity.
The exception to the above is the US$100.0m variable rate loan which is not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity.
This borrowing forms part of the Groups hedge of its net investment in foreign operations and, as such, exchange rate uctuations in respect of this borrowing have no effect on profit or loss and would be offset within shareholders equity.
The Weir Group PLC Annual Report 2007 89 Notes to the Group Financial Statements Continued 30.
Financial instruments continued Similarly, the Groups cross currency swaps, amounting to US$403.0m, and certain forward foreign currency contracts, amounting to US$150.0m, are not denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity.
These derivative financial instruments also form part of the Groups hedge of its net investment in foreign operations and therefore exchange rate uctuations in respect of these financial instruments have no effect on profit or loss and would be offset within shareholders equity.
The Group also maintains a policy that all operating units hedge using forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate exposures on material committed transactions.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant concentration of foreign currency risk has been identied also apply hedge accounting.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash ow hedge.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash ow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate uctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
The Group considers the most significant foreign currency risk relates to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and US dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of the outstanding forward foreign currency contracts in those subsidiary operations which are not required by the Group to apply hedge accounting and the effect on shareholders equity in respect of the outstanding forward foreign currency contracts in those subsidiary operations which do apply hedge accounting, both analysed by the relevant foreign currency.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts their translation at the year end for a 5% strengthening of sterling against the relevant exchange rates.

Commodity price risk The Groups exposure to raw material price risk is generally diminished by restricting bid validity to periods within those quoted by suppliers and by material price escalation clauses.
Credit risk The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and amounts due under construction contracts.
The Group is exposed to risk over a large number of countries and customers and there is no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate.
Due to long established relationships with the majority of customers, the Group does not consider there to be a significant credit quality issue.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash ows.

Financial instruments continued Cash ow hedges At 28 December 2007, the Group held over 500 2006: over 900 forward foreign currency contracts designated as hedges of expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has rm commitments.
The forward foreign currency contracts are used to eliminate currency risk of material rm commitments.
The terms of the contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the year.
The weighted average terms of the contracts are as follows.
Included in the 4.6m was 4.3m in respect of Weir Pumps which was recycled to the income statement in accordance with IAS39 on disposal of the business and this is included within profit for the period from discontinued operations.
Net investment in foreign operation The US dollar variable rate loan included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, amounting to US$100.0m, plus cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts amounting to US$553.0m have been designated as a hedge of the net investment in SPM Flow Control, Inc. and are being used to hedge the Groups exposure to foreign exchange risk on this investment.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investment in this subsidiary.
The US$403.0m cross currency swaps mature between 2008 and 2012 and the US$150.0m forward foreign currency contracts mature in 2008.
