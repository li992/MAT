4 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes treasury shares and the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
For the diluted earnings per share calculation, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for the number of shares that would be issued in connection with employee share-based payment plans using the treasury stock method.
In addition, for 2006 and 2005, the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders has been adjusted for the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP.
Also in 2006 and 2005, the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year has been adjusted for the number of shares to be issued for the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP.
