Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 26 Commitments and contingencies continued Operating lease commitments The Group has entered into commercial leases on certain motor vehicles, small items of plant and machinery, and land and buildings, where it is not in the best interest of the group to purchase these assets.
The plant and machinery has an average life of between 5 and 10 years with renewal terms included in the contracts.
Renewals are at the option of the specific entity that holds the lease.
There are no restrictions placed upon the lessee by entering into these leases.
Future minimum rentals payable under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December are as follows: 2007 2006 m m Amounts payable: Within one year 3.8 3.1 After one year but not more than five years 8.0 6.7 In over five years 3.8 2.0 15.6 11.8 Capital commitments At 31 December 2007, the Group has commitments of 2.1 million 2006: 1.1 million relating to the acquisition of new plant and machinery.
27 Financial instruments The Group's principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, overdrafts, finance leases and hire purchase contracts, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts, the purposes of which are to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Group's operations and its sources of finance.
The Group's accounting policy in relation to derivatives is set out in note 2.
The Group's policy is that it does not trade in financial instruments.
61 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Fair values Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of the Group's financial instruments.
Carrying amount Fair value 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Financial assets Cash and short term investments 27.0 29.0 27.0 29.0 Trade and other receivables 92.7 79.7 92.7 79.7 Other financial assets - interest rate 2.1 2.4 2.1 2.4 swaps Forward exchange contracts - 0.1 - 0.1 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables excluding 57.3 50.6 57.3 50.6 accruals Forward exchange contracts 0.1 - 0.1 - Bank overdrafts 0.3 0.4 0.3 0.4 Obligations under finance leases and hire 2.3 2.1 2.2 2.0 purchase contracts Floating rate borrowings 43.8 42.0 43.9 42.4 Fixed rate borrowings 72.8 70.1 72.9 70.9 classified as fixed rate when including the effects of related interest rate swaps on floating rate borrowings as discussed below.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the tables below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings equates to the carrying amount before unamortised issue costs as the interest thereon is repriced at 31 December.
Certain floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed rate because hedging instruments of matching maturity and notional amount have been obtained.
The fair values of interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates, and are shown separately above, within financial assets and financial liabilities.
For trade and other payables, bank overdrafts and cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts equate to the fair values because of their short durations to maturity.
Other financial assets carried in the balance sheet at a value of 2.1 million include 1.7 million in respect of hedges which have become ineffective due to the change in the expected repayment profile of the underlying hedged item, because of the proposed takeover of the Group by Cookson Group plc, and are therefore treated as fair value through profit or loss assets.
See note 29 for events after the balance sheet date.
The main risks arising from the Group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk.
62 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group's exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to secured loans and cash and cash equivalents.
The Group's policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt.
To achieve this mix, the Group enters into interest rate swaps in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between variable and fixed interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
The following table sets out the carrying amounts of the Group's financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk: 2007 2006 m m Floating rate Cash and cash equivalents 27.0 29.0 Bank overdrafts 0.3 0.4 Bank loans 116.6 112.1 Less: Effect of interest rate swaps 72.8 70.1 Fixed rate Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts 2.3 2.1 Effect of interest rate swaps 72.8 70.1 Interest on cash and cash equivalents is effectively earned at floating rates because of the short duration of any term deposits.
The Group has entered into five year interest rate hedges, swapping 50% of its Sterling denominated secured loans and 75% of its Euro denominated secured loans from floating rate to fixed rate interest throughout the duration of the loans.
At 31 December 2007, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 64% 2006: 63% of the Group's secured loans are at a fixed rate of interest.
A change of 100 basis points from 31 December interest rates would impact profit by approximately 0.2 million in respect of euro-denominated loans and 0.2 million in respect of sterling-denominated loans 2006: 0.1 million and 0.3 million respectively, assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates, based on the unhedged portion of the Group's bank loans.
The impact of such a change upon equity would be limited to the change in the fair value of the unexpired term of the interest rate swaps.
63 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity and flexibility of funding through the use of bank loans, overdrafts, finance leases and hire purchase contracts.
At 31 December 2007 2% of the Group's secured loans were originally scheduled to mature in less than one year 2006: 2%, but they have been shown as entirely repayable within six months in the table below because the takeover of the Group by Cookson Group plc, which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2008, will trigger change of control clauses that demand immediate repayment of the loans.
Cookson have arranged facilities to refinance the Group after the takeover.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including all associated interest payments calculated using rates ruling at 31 December, and assuming 31 December foreign currency exchange rates throughout.

The Group has sought to mitigate the translational effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing 64.4 million in Euro-denominated secured loans, representing 57% of total secured loans 2006: 54%.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating company in currencies other than that company's functional currency.
Approximately 11% of the Group's sales are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the operating company making the sale 2006: 11%, whilst approximately 16% of costs are denominated in currencies other than the operating company's functional currency 2006: 15%.
It is the Group's policy that, where there are firm commitments or anticipated transactions, cash flows in excess of 0.2 million are hedged using forward currency contracts.
65 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk continued Financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operating companies at 31 December were as follows: 2007 2006 mmmm m m Denominated in: Euro US Other Euro US Other Dollar Dollar Trade receivables 1.9 3.1 0.5 1.3 3.0 0.4 Financial assets at fair 1.7 - - - - - value through profit or loss Trade payables 0.5 2.1 0.2 0.3 1.7 0.2 If the euro had strengthened or weakened by 10% against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.3 million lower or higher respectively than that reported 2006: 0.1 million.
If the US dollar had strengthened or weakened by 10% against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.1 million lower or higher respectively than that reported 2006: 0.1 million.
Credit risk Credit risk for the Group arises primarily from trade receivables and other financial assets including cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments.
The Group's maximum amount of credit risk is the carrying value of these assets in the balance sheet.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Credit policy for trade receivables varies from country to country to meet local market and risk circumstances.
Some operating companies purchase bad debt insurance where the cost is appropriate given the risk covered.
Overdue and large debts are monitored regularly.
Cash deposits, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts are placed only with the Group's relationship banks.

The following interest rate swaps expiring May 2010, exchanging floating rate interest for fixed rate interest, have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposure within the Group's policy: Fixed interest Floating interest Notional amount rates payable rates receivable 32.9 million 2.7400% EURIBOR 33.0 million 2.7390% EURIBOR 12.2 million 4.4800% LIBOR 12.2 million 4.4915% LIBOR At inception, the swap contracts had the same duration and other critical terms as the secured borrowings which they hedged.
The sterling denominated hedges were to amortise in step with the scheduled repayments of sterling debt.
As all the Group's secured borrowings become immediately repayable on a change of control, the proposed takeover of the Group by Cookson Group plc, which is regarded as highly likely to be successful after the year-end, will render the interest rate swaps ineffective as hedges from the date of the takeover.
Consequently, 2.1 million relating to the fair value of the swaps which had previously been recognised as a credit in equity has been included within profit for the year as finance income, and 0.4 million relating to the change in fair value of the swaps during the year has been charged to finance costs.
68 Foseco plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 27 Financial instruments continued Capital management The objectives of the Group's capital management policy are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
There has been no change in this policy during 2006 and 2007.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio, defined as net debt divided by total equity plus net debt.
The Group's policy during 2006 and 2007 was to maintain a gearing ratio of between 60% and 80%.
