Return of capital On 14 November, the Group announced its intention to return approximately 120 million of capital to shareholders by way of a B share issue combined with a consolidation of Amlins existing shares on the basis of 8 new ordinary shares for 9 existing ones.
This was subsequently approved by the shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 12 December 2007.
B shares were issued on 17 December 2007 to existing shareholders on the basis of one B share for each ordinary share held on 14 December 2007.
Each B share enabled the shareholder to redeem the share at 22.4 pence per share at various dates in the future up to August 2009 or alternatively to receive a B share initial dividend in January 2008 of 22.4 pence per share.
Following such dividend receipt, the relevant B shares were converted into deferred shares which were themselves redeemed on 14 January 2008 for a total redemption value of one penny in all.
Holders of B shares not redeemed or converted into deferred shares on or around the initial redemption date in January 2008 have the right, subject to the Company having profits available for distibutiion, to receive continuing dividends at the rate of 75% of the sterling six month LIBOR.
The B shares have no right to vote at general meetings of the Company other than to wind up the Company.
They are fully transferable but are not listed on any stock exchange.
The amount outstanding to be returned to B shareholders at 31 December 2007 has been recognised as a liability in note 25.
The total cost of the issue including expenses was 120.4 million which has been charged against share premium.
