Earnings per share Group 2007 2006 pence pence Basic 14.9 28.2 Diluted 14.9 28.1 Earnings per share is calculated using the following amounts of profit attributable to equity shareholders: Group 2007 2006 m m Profit for the financial year 93.2 177.7 Earnings per share is calculated using the number of ordinary shares as follows: Group 2007 2006 Shares m Shares m Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 624.2 630.2 Dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable under Company share schemes 0.8 2.0 Diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares 625.0 632.2 The diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares is calculated by assuming that all shares which could be issued as a result of existing share options and other sharebased payment arrangements are in fact issued.
Issuance of these additional shares would have no material impact on the Group's earnings.
Shares acquired by employee share trusts, which are deducted from retained earnings, have been excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as they are cancelled until such time as they vest unconditionally to the employee.

In respect of loans and advances to customers, the Group and Company hold collateral in the form of mortgages over residential properties.
Loan impairment continued If the collateral amount on each individual loan were capped at the amount of the balance outstanding, and any surplus of collateral values over balances outstanding ignored, the fair value of collateral held would be as follows: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Neither past due nor impaired 37,212.7 29,620.7 23,444.9 16,739.7 Past due but not impaired 2,107.8 1,456.7 901.5 494.7 Individually impaired 146.5 76.6 40.9 18.4 39,467.0 31,154.0 24,387.3 17,252.8 The individually impaired balances above include the following carrying amount of assets in possession 88.1 49.0 21.5 12.9 The fair value of the collateral is estimated by taking the most recent valuation of the property and adjusting for house price inflation.
After a property has been taken into possession, the process for sale is designed to mitigate any loss or maximise any potential surplus for the borrower.
Typically the property is sold by private treaty, via a locally appointed agent, as quickly as possible and for the best price attainable, taking into consideration market, property and general economic conditions.
If it becomes apparent that the property will not sell by private treaty, consideration is given to submitting the property to an auction, following an auction appraisal and a recommendation by the Company's appointed Asset Manager.
During 2007, arrears levels have increased as predicted following the effect of five 25bp base rate increases since August 2006 base rates increased from 4.5% to 5.75% prior to the recent 25bp reduction on December 2007.
The total number of cases three months or more in arrears and in possession has increased to 6,170 2006: 4,337 amounting to 1.63% 2006: 1.30% of the total book.

A special purpose vehicle 'SPV' is a structure comprising one or more legal entities, set up to act as a trust for debt investors, with the aim of obtaining financing.
A Group company sells to another entity the right to receive the cash flows arising on certain loans.
However, the mortgage originator receives substantially all of the post-tax profit of that entity, and hence retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the securitised loans.
Hence the securitised loans are retained on the mortgage originators Balance Sheet.
For the same reason all SPVs to which the Group has transferred rights to mortgages are consolidated into the Group Financial Statements.

Secured funding continued h Bradford & Bingley Covered Bonds LLP A Euro 10,000.0m covered bond programme was launched in May 2004 with the issue of a Euro 2,000.0m note, with bullet maturity in May 2009.
A covered bond is a full recourse debt instrument secured against a pool of eligible mortgages.
Bradford & Bingley Covered Bonds LLP, a limited liability partnership, was formed, and a trustee was appointed to ensure compliance with the covered bond rules.
The pool of mortgages remains on the Balance Sheet of the mortgage issuer.

Where no reliable market price exists an assessment has been made as to the value of the debt security.
This assessment was based on modelling the present value of future expected cash flows, using a discount curve adjusted for credit spread and liquidity, utilising information from a number of sources, including fund manager expectations and the performance of other similar securities.
In the case of structured investment vehicles, fair value also takes into account any published restructuring proposals.
Debt securities are treated as available-for-sale with changes in fair value recorded as a movement in reserves or, in the case of embedded derivatives attached to collateralised debt obligations, through the Income Statement.
Where fair value estimates show significant reductions in market price or where other indicators of potential impairment have occurred for example, ratings downgrades, significant or prolonged decline in market price, or a failure of the vehicle to meet contractual liquidity requirements impairment is assessed.
Any reduction that is considered to be permanent is then taken as a charge through the investment impairment line on the income statement.
Throughout 2007 all collateralised debt obligations and structured investment vehicles were tested for evidence of impairment.
As a result a charge has been made to the Income Statement of 94.4m for asset impairment and 49.7m for reduction in the fair value of embedded derivatives.

Post-retirement benefit obligations a Pension schemes The Group operates a closed defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme the principal scheme, which is administered by trustees.
The funds are independent from those of the Group.
The normal pension age of employees in the scheme is 65.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.
The funds of this scheme are independent from those of the Group.
The Group and Company had no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at 31 December 2007 2006: nil.
The cost in the year to the Group of the defined contribution scheme was 1.4m 2006: 1.2m and the cost to the Company was 1.0m 2006: 0.9m.
b Other post-retirement benefits The Group provides healthcare benefits to some of its pensioners.
The healthcare benefits are provided through a post-retirement medical scheme into which the Company contributes 100% towards the cost of providing medical expense benefits for members who retired before 1 January 1996 and 50% for members who retired after this date.
The total number of members of the scheme as at 31 December 2007 was 515 2006: 557.
Private medical costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
c Accounting treatment The Group accounts for post-retirement benefit costs in accordance with IAS 19.
The full net actuarial deficit is carried on the Group and Company Balance Sheets, and actuarial gains and losses are taken to Group and Company retained earnings rather than being charged or credited in the Income Statement.
The actuarial gain recognised in the Group and Company retained earnings during the year was 53.3m 2006: 20.1m.
More than one employing Group entity contributes to the post-retirement benefit schemes.
As there is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost to individual Group entities the net defined benefit cost is recognised in the Financial Statements of the Company being the sponsoring entity while other individual Group entities, in their individual Financial Statements, recognise a cost equal to their contributions payable for the period.

Post-retirement benefit obligations continued d Employee benefit obligations continued The principal actuarial assumptions expressed as weighted averages were as follows: 2007 2006 To determine benefit obligations Discount rate at 31 December 5.8% 5.1% Future pension increases 3.4% 3.1% Rate of salary increase 5.4% 5.1% To determine the net pension cost Expected return on plan assets 6.3% 5.8% Discount rate 5.1% 4.7% Rate of salary increase 5.1% 4.8% For post-retirement medical plan Discount rate 5.8% 5.1% Inflation 3.4% 3.1% Medical cost trend for 2007 6.5% 7.3% Medical cost trend falling linearly for 2008-2009 6.5% to 5.5% 7.3% to 4.5% Medical cost trend falling linearly for 2010-2011 5.5% 5.9% to 4.5% Medical cost trend from 2012 5.5% 4.5% In determining the expected long-term return on plan assets the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return for the portfolio.
The principal assumption made on life expectancy for active and retired members was to use PA92 YOB base rated up by 2 years.
As an illustration of the mortality rates used, the future life expectancies from age 60 are shown below: Males Females Non-retired members' life expectancy 25.9 28.7 Retired members' life expectancy 23.8 26.8 based on 1965 year of birth based on 1935 year of birth Sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the pension scheme defined benefit obligation to four key assumptions: the discount rate, the rate of inflation, the rate of salary growth and the mortality assumption.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on benefit obligation Discount rate Decrease by 0.5% Increase by 11.9% Inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 10.4% Salary growth above inflation Increase by 0.5% Increase by 1.8% Mortality Decrease by 1 year Increase by 2.3% If the assumptions were to change by the same amount in the opposite direction to those illustrated, the benefit obligation would decrease or increase by a similar percentage to those shown in the table in each case.
Assumed healthcare cost trend rates have an effect on the amounts recognised in staff costs.
A one percentage point change in assumed healthcare cost trend rates would have the following effects: 2007 2006 m m Effect on the aggregate of service cost and interest cost 0.1 0.1 Effect on defined benefit obligations 1.9 1.9 2007 2006 m m Experience adjustments on post-retirement medical plan liabilities: reduction in liability of 0.1 0.1 26.

Provisions continued Empty leasehold premises The empty leasehold premises provision relates to properties which, as at the Balance Sheet date, were no longer used for trading but were subject to a lease agreement.
The provision is based on either known or forecast future rental expenditure: the rental payments are due to be made during the period 2008 to 2017.
Compensation claims Compensation claims relate to potential payments to customers for business written in the past by the Group's independent advisory business.
The provision is calculated on the basis of a reasonable estimate of the size and expected timing of claims.
External factors such as the performance of the stock market and market agitation could influence both the size and timing of payments.
Restructuring costs Other restructuring costs relate to redundancies and contract terminations which had occurred by the Balance Sheet date.
The provision represents amounts expected to be paid in 2008.
It also includes a provision for an insurance premium to cover the professional indemnity liability associated with businesses disposed of during 2004: the liability will run off over the next three years.
Pension review The pension review provision was established to cover compensation payable in connection with phases one and two of the pension review and also a review of free-standing additional voluntary contributions.
The provision was fully expensed during the year.

After three years the long-term element of the scheme may be applied in the form of an additional award of matching shares subject to earnings per share growth.
Matching share awards will be made when compound earnings per share growth is between RPI plus 3% and RPI plus 8%.
The maximum number of matching shares will be three matching shares for each deferred share.
At 31 December 2007 there were 965,410 deferred shares held in trust 2006: 586,088.

A Monte Carlo simulation model is used to determine the Performance Share Plan fair value as the arrangements include market-based performance conditions, and to assist in assessing an appropriate expected vesting period for the Executive Share Option Scheme.
For other share schemes a Black-Scholes methodology is used to value options.
The expected volatility of share price applied in the option pricing models is based on historic Bradford & Bingley plc share price data over a period equivalent to the expected life of the scheme or since the date of flotation 4 December 2000 if shorter.
Awards granted under the Executive Incentive Plan are granted based on performance in the preceding financial year.
The performance criteria include qualitative elements which are not determined until the award date, that is, after the end of the relevant financial year.
The grant date therefore occurs after the employees to whom the award is made have begun providing services.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment the grant date fair value is initially estimated for the purposes of recognising the services received during the period between service commencement date and grant date.
The fair value is then revised once the actual grant date has been established.

Critical accounting judgements and estimates In preparation of the Group's and Company's Financial Statements, estimates are made which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities: estimates are kept under continuous evaluation.
Estimates and judgements are based on historical experience, expectations of future events and other factors.
Judgements: Financial instrument designation Upon initial designation, a certain amount of judgement is required in ascertaining within which category, as prescribed in IAS 39, a financial instrument should be designated.
The IAS 39 categories are detailed in the accounting policies set out in note 1 and the designation is based on the criteria specified in IAS 39.
We note that where financial instruments contain an embedded derivative we have not opted to designate the whole instrument as at fair value through profit and loss which is permissible under the standard.
Qualifying hedge relationships In designating a financial instrument as part of a qualifying hedge relationship the Group and Company have determined that the hedge is expected to be highly effective over the life of the hedging instrument.
In accounting for a derivative as a cash flow hedge the Group and Company have determined that the hedged cash flow exposure relates to highly probable future cash flows.
Impairment of debt securities Critical judgement is applied in determining whether a debt security is impaired.
The factors considered in determining whether an asset is impaired are detailed in note 13.
Securitisations In applying the Group's policies on securitised financial assets, the Group and Company have considered both the degree of transfer of risks and rewards on assets transferred to another entity and the degree of control exercised by the Group over the other entity: - When the Group, in substance, controls the entity to which financial assets have been transferred, the entity is included in these consolidated Financial Statements and the transferred assets continue to be recognised in the Group's Balance Sheet.
- When the Company or another Group entity has transferred financial assets to another entity, but has not transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards relating to the transferred assets, the assets continue to be recognised in the transferring entity's Balance Sheet.
Details of the Group's securitisation activities are given in note 12.
Estimates: Fair value of debt securities Debt securities are carried at fair value.
The method for calculating fair value of debt securities is described in note 13.
For the vast majority of debt securities a reliable market price was available at the year end and has been used as the fair value.
For those debt securities where a model has been used rather than the quoted market price there are a number of assumptions used in determining the fair value.
If the value of these debt securities, excluding synthetic CDOs, used were to increase or decrease by 10% there would be a 2.7m positive or 2.7m negative impact respectively on the Income Statement.
For the debt securities that contain an embedded derivative the synthetic CDOs, a model has been used in certain cases to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative.
A number of assumptions are used in determining the fair value.
If the value of these embedded derivatives were to increase or decrease by 10% there would be a 10.3m positive or 10.3m negative impact respectively on the Income Statement.
Effective interest rate Loans and advances to customers are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis, under which the income is spread over the loan's expected life.
On a quarterly basis, models are reviewed to re-assess expected life by portfolio of products based upon actual redemptions by product.
If the estimated average life of a loan were increased or reduced by one month the Balance Sheet amount of loans and advances to customers at 31 December 2007 would be higher by 3.6m or lower by 3.8m respectively.
Loan impairment The Group reviews its loan impairment on a quarterly basis.
Impairment models use historical loss experience to provide both probabilities of defaults and property forced sale discounts across a portfolio of products.
In addition, management applies a risk weighted view on additional factors, such as specific fraud cases.
If average house prices were to increase or decrease by 5% the reported impairment at 31 December 2007 would be 9.8m lower or 11.6m higher respectively.
Post-retirement benefit obligations The net deficit in respect of post-retirement benefit obligations is carried on the Balance Sheet.
The value of these obligations is calculated by the Group's actuaries using the assumptions set out in note 25.
Note 25 also discloses the impact on the benefit obligations of changes in certain key assumptions.
Provisions Provisions are carried in respect of certain known or forecast future expenditure, as described in note 26.

The primary objectives of the banks capital management are to ensure that the bank complies with externally imposed capital requirements, maintains capital ratios to support development of the business and to cover risks inherent in its activities, to maximise shareholder value and to keep strong credit ratings.
The Group defines Equity, Subordinated Liabilities and Other Capital Instruments as capital.
The bank manages its capital structure in response to changes in the nature of the banks activities and economic conditions.
The bank may return capital to shareholders, adjust the level of dividend or issue capital securities.
During the year the bank commenced a share buy back programme to rebalance the mix of capital by changing the proportions of equity and interest bearing tier 1 capital: this was suspended in the later part of the year due to market conditions.
During the year the Group moved from a Basel I method of assessment to a Basel II Standardised regime.
The banks regulatory capital position is shown above.
Tier 1 capital excludes statutory accounting deductions for available-for-sale assets and the cash flow hedge reserve but includes a regulatory deduction for intangible assets.
Tier 2 capital reflects amortisation of subordinated debt.
The Groups capital adequacy and capital resources are managed and monitored in accordance with the regulatory capital rules of the FSA, the UK regulator.
The bank must at all times monitor and demonstrate compliance with the relevant regulatory capital requirements of the FSA.
The bank has put in place processes and controls to monitor and manage the banks capital adequacy and no breaches were reported to the FSA during the year.
The Company capital is represented by the capital and reserves attributable to equity holders and is sufficient to meet the needs of the Company in its operations and in payment of dividends.

Cash and balances at central banks and loans and advances to banks: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Loans and advances to customers: where floating rate loans and advances to customers have been issued at market rates we have assumed fair value approximates to book value.
Given current market conditions, it is not known whether these fair values are reflective of prices that could be achieved on the open market: however, there is no intent to sell these loans.
Fixed rate mortgage balances, within loans and advances to customers, are fair valued using discounted cash flow models, using prevailing market rates, with underlying assumptions based on current market conditions.
Debt securities and treasury bills: fair value has been estimated through reference to market price or specific restructuring proposals.
Where no market price exists an assessment has been made as to the value of the security.
This assessment is based on modelling the present value of future expected cash flows, using a discount curve adjusted for credit spread and liquidity, utilising information from a number of sources, including fund manager expectations and the performance of other similar securities.
Derivative financial instruments, other financial assets and deposits by banks: the fair value is their carrying amount.
Customer accounts: the fair value is estimated from expected future cash flows, discounted at current market rates.
Debt securities in issue, subordinated liabilities and other capital instruments: the fair value is based upon quoted market prices in active markets or discounted expected cash flows using market rates applicable to the credit quality and maturity of the instrument.
Other financial liabilities: the fair value is their carrying amount.
No financial assets were reclassified during 2007 or 2006 by the Group or Company between amortised cost and fair value categories.
b Trading book During the year the Group commenced trading activities in derivatives.
The net trading income for the year, which is all included in the Income Statement within realised gains less losses on financial instruments, was 1.0m.
The fair value of these held for trading derivatives at 31 December 2007 was not material and therefore does not appear in note 39a.

The secured property can be repossessed in the event of borrower default, in which case the carrying value of the loan is reduced if the estimated recoverable amount is lower than the outstanding balance owed, in accordance with the accounting policy described in note 1.
The repossessed property is carried on the Balance Sheet within loans and advances to customers.
A credit exposure could arise in respect of derivative contracts entered into by the Group if the counterparty were unable to fulfil its contractual obligations.
The Group addresses the risks associated with these activities by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and requiring additional collateral to be posted or returned as necessary.
The only forms of collateral accepted by the Group are cash and government securities.
Derivatives are transacted under ISDA with CSA annexes and as such may require collateral to be posted from time to time.

These loans, and also the other financial assets shown above which we have pledged, are carried on the Groups and Companys Balance Sheets.
For those transactions which qualify and are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, hedge accounting treatment is applied.
Fair value hedges are primarily used to hedge against changes in fair value of fixed rate products due to movements in market interest rates.
For the year ended 31 December 2007, the Group recognised fair value losses of 23.5m 2006: gains of 0.3m, representing the ineffective portion of the fair value hedges.
Cash flow hedges are used to hedge the risk of exposure to variability of cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability, or a forecast transaction.
Any gains or losses on cash flow hedges are recorded in equity until the hedged cash flow occurs, whereupon they are transferred to profit or loss for the period.
As at 31 December 2007, net losses accumulated in equity were 60.4m 2006: gains of 20.6m.
Hedge effectiveness is measured and assessed on an ongoing basis and was determined to be actually effective throughout the year.
Changes in fair values and cash flows of the hedged items were almost fully offset by changes in fair values and cash flows of the hedging instruments, and actual effectiveness was within a range of 80% to 125%.
The Group has recognised embedded derivatives within certain products and has classified them with derivatives in accordance with IAS 39.
Forward starting swaps are entered into, in anticipation of the take up of fixed rate mortgages.
These are treated as cash flow hedges.
Cash flow ineffectiveness testing incorporates testing for forecast transactions which are no longer expected to occur.

Risk management a A description of the principal risks to which the Group and Company are exposed is provided on pages 18 to 21.
The following table describes the significant activities undertaken by the Group, the risks associated with such activities and the types of derivatives which are typically used in managing such risks.
Activity Risk Type of derivative instrument used Fixed rate savings products and funding Sensitivity to changes in interest rates Interest rate swaps and interest rate futures activities in Sterling involving either fixed rate instruments or instruments with embedded options Fixed and capped rate mortgage lending and Sensitivity to changes in interest rates Interest rate swaps and options investment activities involving either fixed rate instruments or instruments with embedded options Investment and funding in foreign currencies Sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates Cross-currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts Equity-linked investment products Sensitivity to changes in equity indices Equity-linked swaps Variable rate products Sensitivity to changes in interest rates Interest rate swaps The accounting policy for derivatives and hedge accounting is described in note 1. b Credit risk Before taking account of any collateral, the maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: Group Company 2007 2006 2007 2006 m m m m Cash and balances at central banks 209.2 202.6 209.2 202.6 Treasury bills 185.0 - 185.0 - Loans and advances to banks 2,392.1 3,301.4 1,901.9 2,413.5 Loans and advances to customers 40,444.5 36,131.7 51,435.4 41,895.5 Debt securities 6,778.7 5,299.9 7,398.2 4,840.9 Derivative financial instruments 1,175.4 291.0 468.6 278.2 Other financial assets 661.0 34.2 659.6 40.3 Total on - Balance Sheet 51,845.9 45,260.8 62,257.9 49,671.0 Irrevocable undrawn loan facilities off - Balance Sheet see note 34 1,900.7 2,305.7 75.7 522.0 Total maximum exposure to credit risk 53,746.6 47,566.5 62,333.6 50,193.0 In respect of loans and advances to banks and customers and derivative financial instruments the Group and Company may hold reverse repurchase agreements and may also hold cash as security see notes 39e and 39f.
Loans and advances to customers are secured on property.
In respect of Lifetime mortgages, the irrevocable undrawn loan facility is calculated using actuarial assumptions.
There is no commitment to advance further cash: the commitment reflects interest expected to roll up on the loans until redemption.

Risk management continued c Liquidity risk It should be noted that many financial instruments are settled earlier than their contractual maturity dates: in particular, many mortgage loans are repaid early in full or in part.
The Group closely monitors its liquidity position against the Boards liquidity policy.
This policy sets out elements of available and required liquidity through reference to and modelling of net lending commitments, short and medium term wholesale commitments, liquidity reserves, retail deposit growth and the requirement for other payments e. g. dividends and tax.
From this, minimum and target liquidity levels are established.
Furthermore, liquidity is also measured in proportion to the total Balance Sheet and is subject to trigger levels: these determine the appropriate levels of escalation in order to address any actual or forecast shortfalls.
The liquidity policy also requires stress testing through modelling and assessment of any emerging and potentially extreme funding conditions.

Risk management continued d Interest rate risk Market risk is the potential adverse change in Group income or Group net worth arising from movements in interest rates, exchange rates or other market prices.
Effective identification and management of market risk is essential for maintaining stable net interest income.
The most significant form of market risk to which the Group is exposed is interest rate risk.
This typically arises from mismatches between the repricing dates of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities on the Groups Balance Sheet, and from the investment profile of the Groups capital and reserves.
Treasury is responsible for managing this exposure within the risk exposure limits set out in the Balance Sheet Management policy, as approved by ALCO and the Board.
This policy sets out the nature of the market risks that may be taken along with aggregate risk limits, and stipulates the procedures, instruments and controls to be used in managing market risk.
It is ALCOs responsibility to approve strategies for managing market risk exposures and to ensure that Treasury implements the strategies so that the exposures are managed within the Groups approved policy limits.
The Group assesses its exposure to interest rate movements using a number of techniques.
However, there are two principal methods: a a static framework that considers the impact on the current Balance Sheet of an immediate movement of interest rates: and b a dynamic modelling framework that considers the projected change to both the Balance Sheet and product mortgage and savings rates over the following year under various interest rate scenarios.
The results of these analyses are presented to senior management in order to identify, measure and manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group remained within all its interest rate risk exposure limits during the year and preceding year.
Limits are placed on the sensitivity of the Group Balance Sheet to movements in interest rates.
Exposures are reviewed as appropriate by senior management and the Board with a frequency between daily and monthly, related to the granularity of the position.
For example, the overall Group Balance Sheet interest rate risk exposure position is monitored monthly whilst several specific portfolios within the Balance Sheet are reviewed more frequently on a daily or weekly basis.
This reflects the dynamics and materiality of the various portfolios.
Interest rate risk exposure is predominantly managed through the use of interest rate derivatives, principally interest rate swaps and interest rate futures contracts.
Interest rate swaps are over-the-counter arrangements with highly rated banking counterparties, while futures contracts are transacted through regulated Futures Exchanges.
The Group also uses asset and liability positions to offset exposures naturally wherever possible to minimise the costs and risks of arranging transactions external to the Group.
In general, swaps which have been taken out to manage Group interest rate risk are held by the Company even where the related financial instruments are held by other Group entities.
In these cases, the Companys interest rate risk is managed by either creating swaps between the Company and the entities which hold the instruments or by setting the interest rate terms on loan balances between the Company and those entities, in each case in order to reduce the Companys interest rate risk to a low and acceptable level.
Interest rate sensitivities are reported to ALCO monthly and are calculated using a range of interest rate scenarios, including non parallel shifts in the yield curve.
The sensitivities below are based upon reasonably possible changes in interest rates and they assume parallel shifts in the yield curve.
At the Balance Sheet date a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would improve reduce annual net interest income by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: Group 2007 2006 m m 1% increase 4.4 0.7 1% decrease 8.2 4.2 At the Balance Sheet date a 1% increase or decrease in interest rates compared to actual rates would increase decrease equity by the following amounts, prior to mitigation: Group 2007 2006 m m 1% increase 16.0 19.2 1% decrease 17.1 2.6 In January 2007, the Group and Company established a modest trading book, which is subject to a risk limit framework that is reported daily.
The trading book held no significant interest rate risk as at 31 December 2007.

Risk management continued e Foreign currency risk The Groups policy is to hedge all material foreign currency exposures.
Due to the use of derivatives, at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006 the Group and Company had no net material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.
The impact on the Groups profit and equity of reasonably possible changes in exchange rates compared to actual rates would have been immaterial at 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2006.
Loans and advances to customers are all secured on property in the UK.
59% 2006: 58% of loans and advances to customers are concentrated in the buy-to-let market: the remaining balances are mainly secured on residential owner-occupied properties.
The Group has investments in a range of debt securities issued by government bodies, banks and building societies, and in asset-backed securities, in both the UK and overseas.
UK government securities, bank and supranational securities and bank certificates of deposit comprise 61% 2006: 55% of debt securities held.
68% 2006: 67% of the asset-backed securities are UK invested.
Customer accounts comprise investment and savings accounts held by customers.
20% of these 2006: 20% were opened through direct channels and 11% 2006: 15% through Bradford & Bingley International Ltd, the Groups deposit taker on the Isle of Man.
Debt securities in issue represent bonds, medium term notes and other debt securities issued in a range of countries and currencies with no significant investment by any individual counterparty.
