Currency derivatives The group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash ows.
The group is party to a number of forward currency contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The instruments purchased are primarily denominated in US dollars.
At the balance sheet date, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the group is committed was 10.3m 2006: 5.0m.
At 31 March 2007 the fair value of the groups currency derivatives is estimated to be an approximate liability of 0.1m 2006: asset of 0.3m.
These amounts are based on quoted forward currency rates at the balance sheet date.
Amounts of 172,000 2006: 101,000 have been credited to the income statement in respect of contracts matured during the period.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging currency derivatives amounting to 381,000 have been charged to income in the year 2006: 965,000 credit to income.
Interest rate derivatives The group uses interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its bank borrowings by the use of interest rate Collar arrangements.
Contracts with a nominal value of 50m have a Cap of 5.75% and a Floor of 4.70% for the period to 4 January 2010 and contracts with a nominal value of 50m have a Cap of 6.25% and a Floor of 4.24% for the period to 4 January 2010.
At 31 March 2007 the fair value of the groups interest rate derivatives is 0.3m 2006: liability of 0.02m.
These amounts are based on quoted market prices for equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Changes in the fair value of non-hedging interest rate derivatives amounting to 298,000 have been credited to income in the year 2006: 42,000.
Due to the nature of many of the groups hedging and derivative instruments, hedge accounting has not been adopted for these hedging relationships.
Consequently, movements in the fair value of derivative instruments have been recognised in the income statement.
