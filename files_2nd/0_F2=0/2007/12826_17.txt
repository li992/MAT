notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 decemBer 2007 1. group accounting policies BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The financial information has also been prepared under the historical cost convention except that it has been modified to include financial assets and liabilities including derivatives at their fair value through the Income Statement.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC is incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2007 were approved by the Board of directors on 2 April 2008.
FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATIONAL CURRENCY The financial information has been presented in Euros, which is the functional currency.
All financial information presented has been rounded to the nearest thousand.
USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with adopted IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income, expenses and contingent liabilities.
Estimates and assumptions mainly relate to the useful life of noncurrent assets, the discounted cash flows used in impairment testing and the establishing of provisions for litigation, pensions and other benefits, taxes, inventory valuations, and guarantees.
Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual values may vary from the estimates.
The estimates and the assumptions are under continuous review.
Critical accounting and valuation policies and methods are those that are both most important to the depiction of the Groups financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and that require the application of subjective and complex judgements, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods.
The critical accounting policies that we disclose, will not necessarily result in material changes to our financial statements in any given period but rather contain a potential for material change.
The main accounting and valuation policies used by the Group are outlined in the following notes.
While not all of the significant accounting policies require subjective or complex judgements, the Group considers that the following accounting policies should be considered critical accounting policies.
Property, plant and equipment are amortised over their estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are based on estimates of the period during which the assets will generate revenue.
Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may no longer be recoverable.
Although we believe that our estimates of the relevant expected useful lives, our assumptions concerning the business environment and developments in our industry, and our estimations of the discounted future cash flows, are appropriate, changes in assumptions or circumstances could require changes in the analysis.
This could lead to additional impairment charges or allowances in the future or to valuation writebacks should the expected trends reverse.
To compute provisions for taxes, estimates have to be applied.
These estimates involve assessing the probability that deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised to offset taxable income.
The defined benefit plans are partly unfunded and partly funded through pension insurance contracts.
Statistical and actuarial methods are used to anticipate future events in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to the plans.
These calculations include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future pension increases.
Statistical information such as withdrawal and mortality rates is also used in estimating the expenses and liabilities under the plans.
Because of changing market and economic conditions, the expenses and liabilities actually arising from these plans in the future may differ materially from the estimates made on the basis of these actuarial assumptions.
30 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. group accounting policies continued BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Group and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December 2007.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group obtains and exercises control through voting rights.
The results of any subsidiary sold or acquired are included in the Group Income Statement up to, or from, the date control passes.
Unrealised gains on intragroup transactions are eliminated fully on consolidation.
Consolidation is conducted by eliminating the investment in the subsidiary with the parents share of the net equity of the subsidiary.
The Group owns 100% of the voting rights in Crystalox Japan Kabushiki Kaisha.
Minority interests in equity of 43,400 are related to nonredeemable preferred stock, subject to a guaranteed annual dividend payment of 2,000.
As the fair value of the resulting dividend liabilities reduces the equity portion to marginal amounts, all minority interest has been reclassified as liabilities.
The Group intends to withdraw the preferred stock in the near future.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiarys separable, identifiable assets and liabilities existing at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair value reflecting their condition at that date.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
So far no acquisitions have taken place since inception of the Group.
Amounts reported in the financial statements of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.
All intergroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated upon consolidation.
On 5 January 2007, PV Crystalox Solar PLC became the legal parent group of PV Crystalox Solar AG and its subsidiary companies in a share for share transaction.
The former PV Crystalox Solar AG shareholders became the shareholders of PV Crystalox Solar PLC.
Following the transaction the Groups continuing operations and executive management were those of PV Crystalox Solar AG.
Accordingly, the substance of the combination was that PV Crystalox Solar AG acquired PV Crystalox Solar PLC in a reverse acquisition.
The Companies Act 1985 and IFRS would normally require the Groups consolidated accounts to follow the legal form of the business combination.
In that case the preacquisition results would be those of PV Crystalox Solar PLC and its subsidiary undertakings, which would exclude PV Crystalox Solar AG.
The results of PV Crystalox Solar AG would then be included in the Group from 5 January 2007.
However, this would portray the combination as an acquisition of PV Crystalox Solar AG by PV Crystalox Solar PLC and would, in the opinion of the directors, fail to give a true and fair view of the substance of the business combination.
Accordingly, the directors have adopted reverse acquisition accounting as the basis of consolidation in order to give a true and fair view.
The reverse acquisition was accounted for using the equity accounting method.
As a consequence of applying reverse acquisition accounting, the comparative results for the Group for the period ended 31 December 2006 comprise the results of PV Crystalox Solar AG and its subsidiary undertakings, which were prepared under IFRS in the previous year.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 31 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 decemBer 2007 1. group accounting policies continued EFFECTS OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Accounting standards applied for the first time in 2007 In August 2005, the IASB issued the standard IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, which has been applied for the first time in the current year.
This standard specifies the information on financial instruments that is to be provided in the notes to the financial statements.
IFRS 7 provides for financial instruments to be grouped into certain categories and specific disclosures to be made for each category, including the significance of the instruments and the nature and extent of the risks associated with them.
The new standard has affected the nature and modality of financial instrument disclosures in the financial statements of the Group, but not the recognition or measurement of the instruments.
In particular, the consolidated financial statements now feature: an explanation of the Groups market risk exposure in regards to its financial instruments: a maturity analysis that shows the remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities: and an analysis of trade receivables showing those past due or considered to be impaired.
In January 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2.
The issue addressed in the Interpretation is whether IFRS 2 applies to transactions in which the entity cannot identify specifically some or all of the goods or services received.
The application of this interpretation has not had a material impact on the Groups financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In March 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives.
This Interpretation addresses the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and considers whether the assessment of whether a contract has embedded derivatives should be reassessed throughout the life of the contract.
The IFRIC concluded that subsequent reassessment is prohibited unless there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that otherwise would be required under the contract, in which case reassessment is required.
In July 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment.
This interpretation addresses the interaction between the requirements of IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting and the recognition of impairment losses on goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and investments in equity instruments as well as financial assets carried at cost under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The IFRIC concluded that an entity, which has recognised an impairment loss in an interim period in respect of goodwill or an investment in either an equity instrument or a financial asset carried at cost, that impairment must not be reversed in subsequent financial statements or in annual financial statements.
IFRIC 10 has to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 November 2006.
32 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. group accounting policies continued EFFECTS OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS CONTINUED Newly issued accounting standards A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2007, and have not yet been applied in preparing these financial statements.
IFRS 8 Operating Segments is mandatory for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009 and supersedes the current standard, IAS 14 Segment Reporting.
Early application of IFRS 8 has been adopted.
In November 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions.
The interpretation addresses how to apply IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment to accounting for sharebased payment arrangements involving an entitys own equity instruments.
It also provides guidance on whether sharebased payment arrangements, in which suppliers of goods or services of an entity are provided with equity instruments of the entitys parent should be accounted for as cashsettled or equitysettled in the entitys financial statements.
IFRIC 11 has to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 March 2007.
The Group is currently evaluating the impact that the application of the interpretation may have on the Groups financial position, results of operation or cash flows.
In November 2006, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements.
Service concessions are arrangements whereby a government or other public sector entity grants contracts for the supply of public services such as roads, airports, prisons and energy and water supply and distribution facilities to private sector operators.
IFRIC 12 has to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008.
The Group does not believe that the application of this interpretation will have a material impact on the Groups financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2007, the IFRIC issued IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes.
Customer loyalty programmes are used by entities to provide customers with incentives to buy their goods or services.
If a customer buys goods or services, the entity grants the customer award credits often described as points.
The customer can redeem the award credits for awards such as free or discounted goods or services.
IFRIC 13 has to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 The limit on a defined benefit asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction, is effective from January 2008.
The Group will apply IFRIC 14 from January 2008, but it is not expected to have any impact on the Group or Companys accounts.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations has been revised.
The revised standard has to be applied to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Early application is permitted provided that IAS 27 as amended in 2008 see below is applied at the same time.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements has been revised to clarify the classification of balance sheet items between current and noncurrent, and an entitys compliance with IFRS.
The revised standard has to be applied to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
IAS 23 Borrowing Costs has been revised so that guidance on effective interest rates is consistent with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements has been revised to extend the application of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement to investments in subsidiaries which are classified as held sale in the parents separate financial statements.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation has been amended to provide details of the disclosure required when investments in associates and jointly controlled entities are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
The amended standard has to be applied to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2009.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 33 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 decemBer 2007 1. group accounting policies continued FINANCING STRATEGY AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures and the complementary amendment to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements Capital Disclosures, introduces new disclosures relating to financial instruments.
This does not have any impact on the classification and valuation of the Group financial instruments, or the disclosures relating to taxation and trade and other payables.
We define capital as equity plus cash and our financial strategy in the medium term is to manage a level of debt that balances the risks of the business with optimising the return on equity by the use of gearing.
The Group is currently cash positive following our IPO in June 2007, although these funds will be mainly utilised for capital investment in the planned polysilicon plant and in the expansion of our existing business.
The only significant borrowings in the Group are in Japan and we take advantage of the relatively low Japanese Yen interest rate to finance our business in Japan.
These borrowings have attached covenants and are secured against our Japanese Yen receivables book.
The terms of the covenants have been and will continue to be adhered to.
The Japanese receivables book and our ongoing sales in Japanese Yen will continue to generate a strong forward cash inflow and accordingly we are not carrying exchange rate risk in respect of these borrowings.
The weighted average rate of interest in 2007 was 1.5% 2006: 1.5% and our gearing ratio was 9% 2006: 7%.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets are capitalised at cost and amortised over a useful life of three to five years.
Amortisation of intangible assets is recorded under Depreciation and amortisation in the Income Statement.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised at the costs that were necessary to purchase the licences and make the software usable.
The capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method over the expected economic life of the patents five years or software three to five years.
INTERNALLYGENERATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense when incurred.
Internal development expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Technical and other uncertainties generally have the effect that such criteria are not met.
However, expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes, is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of services and materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Otherwise, development expenditure is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense as occurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Intangible assets relating to products in development both internally and externally acquired are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment.
Any impairment losses are written off immediately to the Income Statement.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefit of the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed as it occurs.
Only patents have been capitalised as development costs to date, as the future utilisation of other developments is not sufficiently determinable or certain.
34 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. group accounting policies continued PROPERTY, PLANT AND EqUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition or construction cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
No interest or depreciation is charged during the period of construction.
The cost of own work capitalised is comprised of direct costs of material and manufacturing and directly attributable costs of manufacturing overheads.
The capitalised costs are written down using the straightline method.
The Groups policy is to write off the difference between the cost of each tangible fixed asset and its residual value systematically over its estimated useful life.
Reviews of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual productive assets are made annually, taking commercial and technological obsolescence as well as normal wear and tear into account.
The total useful lives range from approximately 25 years for buildings, five to ten years for plant and equipment, up to ten years for fixtures and fittings and four years for motor vehicles.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
All tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment at each balance sheet date or upon existence of indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Income Statement.
IMPAIRMENT The carrying amount of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are subject to impairment testing upon indication of impairment and are reviewed annually.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value, reflecting market conditions less costs of disposal, and value in use based on an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.
LEASED ASSETS The economic ownership of a leased asset is transferred to the lessee if the lessee bears all the risks and rewards related to the ownership of the leased asset in a material fashion.
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the Income Statement on a straightline basis over the lease term.
Lease incentives are spread over the total period of the lease.
The obligations from lease contracts are disclosed among financial obligations.
For the reporting period, no assets were recorded under finance leases.
CASH AND CASH EqUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with maturities of less than three months.
Cash and cash equivalents are valued at their nominal value.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 35 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 decemBer 2007 1. group accounting policies continued FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value net of transaction costs, if changes in value are not charged directly to the Income Statement.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, as follows: fixed deposits, generally funds held with banks and short term borrowings and overdrafts are classified as receivables and loans and held at amortised cost: derivatives, if any, comprising interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts, are classified as held for trading.
They are included at fair value, upon the advice of the local bank: long term loans are held at amortised cost: noninterest bearing trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost, less provisions for impairment.
Any change in their value through impairment or reversal of impairment is recognised in the Income Statement: and trade payables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and thereafter at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
Changes in the fair value relating to all these financial instruments are treated as follows: exchange rate losses and impairments are recognised in the Income Statement.
All other changes in fair value are taken to reserves.
On disposal of the related asset, the accumulated changes in fair value recorded in reserves are included in the gain or loss recorded in the Income Statement.
Interest and other income resulting from financial assets are recognised in the Income Statement when receivable, regardless of how the related carrying amount of the financial assets is measured.
TRADE RECEIVABLES Trade receivables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently valued at amortised cost in compliance with the effective interest method, less impairment.
Impairment of trade receivables is recorded if there are objective indicators that suggest that the debts are not fully recoverable, or that the fair value of the receivable is impaired at the balance sheet date.
INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Acquisition costs for raw materials usually are determined by the weighted average method.
For finished goods and work in progress, cost of production includes directly attributable costs for material and manufacturing and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses including depreciation based on normal levels of activity.
Selling expenses and other overhead expenses are excluded.
Interest expenses are expensed as incurred and therefore not included.
Net realisable value is determined as estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Due to the current market situation, no significant valuation allowances were necessary.
36 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. group accounting policies continued FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Financial liabilities are valued at their first inclusion in the financial statements at their fair value, less transaction costs.
In subsequent periods, they are measured at amortised cost.
The transaction costs are carried as an expense using the effective interest method over the term of the respective financial liability.
Noncurrent financial liabilities are charged with a variable interest rate in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements.
Due to the variable interest rate charged on financial liabilities, the amortised cost corresponds to the fair value.
Loans payable are classified as current liabilities, provided the Group does not have the unconditional right to postpone paying off the liability until a date at least twelve months after the balance sheet date.
INCOME TAXES The charge for taxation is based on the profits for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes.
In accordance with IFRS, the expected future tax credits from the utilisation of tax losses carry forwards are also recognised on the basis that there are considered to be sufficient future profits.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at local tax rates that are expected to apply to their respective period of realisation, provided that they are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
PUBLIC GRANTS AND SUBSIDIES As the German operations are located in a region designated for economic development, the Group receives both investment subsidies and investment grants.
Government grants and subsidies relating to capital expenditure are credited to the Deferred income account and are released to the Income Statement by equal annual instalments over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets under Other income.
Government grants of a revenue nature, mainly for research and development purposes, are credited to the Income Statement in the same period as the related expenditure.
All required conditions of these grants have been and will continue to be met.
PROVISIONS Provisions are formed where a thirdparty obligation exists, which will lead to a probable future outflow of resources and where this outflow can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
If a provision is not considered necessary because a future outflow of resources is only considered possible and not probable, the corresponding obligations are reported as contingent liabilities.
Contingent liabilities are determined at the present value of the expected outflow of resources.
Provisions include both provisions and accruals.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Provisions are made for legal disputes where there is an obligation at the balance sheet date, an adverse outcome is probable and associated costs can be estimated reliably.
Where no obligation is present at the balance sheet date no provision is made, although the contingent liability will be disclosed in a note.
PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 37 notes to the consolidated financial statements continued for the year ended 31 decemBer 2007 1. group accounting policies continued REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
Revenues exclude intergroup sales and valueadded taxes and represent net invoice value less estimated rebates, returns and settlement discounts.
The net invoice value is measured by reference to the fair value of consideration received or receivable by the Group for goods supplied.
The Group has outsourced some elements of production to external companies.
In cases in which the Group retains power of disposal over the product or product element, a sale is only recognised under IFRS when the final product is sold.
The final product is deemed to have been sold when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a third party.
The Group has two sales segments: Silicon Products and Trading and Equipment.
These are defined as follows: The Silicon Products segment consists of silicon ingots and wafers produced by Group companies and sold to solar cell manufacturers.
This segment is the core business of the Group.
The Trading & Equipment segment is mainly the sourcing of silicon ingots from a key supplier to the Group and the onwards supply of these ingots to a major customer.
This is done to facilitate these two key relationships and is not a long term activity of the Group.
In addition, the Trading & Equipment segment includes a relatively small amount of spare parts manufactured by the Group.
These sales of spare parts are made to customers that operate equipment that had been built by the Group in the past.
The Group no longer supplies crystal growth equipment and accordingly the sale of spare parts is expected to fall over the coming years.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The consolidated financial statements are prepared in Euros, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Euros at the average foreign exchange rates of the year that the transactions occurred in.
Transactions of the included entities in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the respective entity at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Euros at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange rate differences arising on transactions are recognised in the Income Statement.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Nonmonetary assets and liabilities that are stated at fair value are translated to Euros at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
Exchange gains and losses on short term foreign currency borrowings and deposits are shown as such and taken to operating profit.
In the consolidated financial statements exchange rate differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in subsidiaries together with those on relevant foreign currency loans are taken directly to the Currency translation adjustment in equity.
INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSES Net financing costs are comprised interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income and gains, and any gains and losses on hedging instruments are recognised in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the Income Statement on the date is has been received.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
38 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 1. group accounting policies continued SEGMENT REPORTING A business segment is a group of assets and operating activities that provides products or services, which differ in terms of their risks and opportunities from those of other areas of business.
A geographical segment provides products or services within a certain economic environment with risks and opportunities different from those in other economic environments.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Group operate a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions to a separate entity.
The Group therefore has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in current and prior periods.
The liability recognised in the Balance Sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of government bonds at the balance sheet date with a ten year maturity, adjusted for additional term to maturity of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited directly to the Income Statement in the period in which they arise.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional to the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to pension insurance plans on a contractual basis.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
SHAREBASED PAYMENTS The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Sharebased payments.
The Group issues equitysettled equitybased payments to certain employees.
These are measured at their fair value at the date of the grant and are expensed over the vesting period, based, where necessary, on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, and adjusted for any market based conditions.
Grants of shares made during 2007 are not subject to performance criteria and were valued at the date of the grant at market value.
Valuations were confirmed by using the BlacksScholes Option Pricing Model.
Charges made to the Income Statement in respect of sharebased payments are credited to retained earnings.

The contracts have durations of up to ten years.
In some cases there are options to extend the rental period.
However, in readiness for the construction of the polysilicon plant, the Group purchased, in 2007, land with an area of approximately 2 31,000m in the Chemical Park at Bitterfield in Germany.
Selling expenses mainly include delivery costs and warranty provisions.
Technical consulting and research and development costs relate to the expenditure in connection with silicon wafers and ingots.
Also included are preliminary costs relating to plans for a plant to produce solar silicon feedstock.
In addition to those disclosed above, the Group undertakes considerable research and development in the field of continuous production process optimisation and improvement and adaptation of products to market requirements.
These costs are an integral part of a highly technical production process.

The German corporation tax rate in 2007 and 2006 was 25% plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% of corporation tax.
This resulted in an effective corporation tax rate of 26.375%.
The effective trade income tax amounted to 16.67%.
Taking into account the deductibility of trade income tax from corporation tax, the total tax rate for the German companies was 38.65%.
The total tax rate of Crystalox Limited in the UK was 30%, and the total tax rate in Japan was 42.05%.
These rates are always based on the legal regulations applicable or adopted at the balance sheet date.

The plan will be fully funded upon retirement of the employees by insurance contracts held and paid in by the Group.
In case of insolvency the benefits have been ceded to the employees directly.
Therefore the fair value of the insurance contracts has been treated as plan asset.
Pastservice costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional to the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the pastservice costs are amortised on a straightline basis over the vesting period.
The Group contributions are paid directly to the asset holding insurance company, thereby guaranteeing the value of the scheme which is deemed wholly funded.

PV Crystalox Solar PLC was incorporated on 5 December 2006 with an authorised share capital of 50,000.
The authorised share capital was increased by Special Resolution on 20 December 2006 to 7,950,002 and further increased by Special Resolution on 21 May 2007 to 8,000,000.
In December 2006, the Company made an offer to each of the shareholders of PV Crystalox Solar AG to purchase all of their shares in PV Crystalox Solar AG in exchange for the issue to them of an equivalent number of shares in the Company.
On 5 January 2007, the Company issued 5,625,000 ordinary shares of 1.00 each to the UK based shareholders in exchange for an equivalent number of shares in PV Crystalox Solar AG held by them.
On 10 May 2007, the Company issued a further 1,875,000 ordinary shares of 1.00 each to the remaining shareholders in PV Crystalox Solar AG, again, in consideration for an equivalent number of shares in PV Crystalox Solar AG held by them.
Except for the two ordinary shares of 1.00 each issued for cash at incorporation, the remaining 7,500,000 issued ordinary shares of 1.00 each in the Company were issued in exchange for shares in PV Crystalox Solar AG.
By resolutions passed at the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company held on 21 May 2007 each ordinary share of 1.00 in the capital of the Company both issued and unissued was subdivided into 50 ordinary shares of 2 pence each.
The Company established an Employee Benefit Trust, a Jersey based employee benefit Trust, on 18 January 2007, which has acquired, and may in the future acquire, the Companys ordinary shares for the benefit of the Groups employees.
A number of share grants were made to key employees on 17 December 2007.
The Currency translation adjustment represents the differences arising from the currency translation of investments in subsidiaries.
SUMMARY OF RIGHTS OF SHARE CAPITAL The ordinary shares are entitled to receipt of dividends.
On winding up their rights are restricted to a repayment of the amount paid up and to share in any surplus assets arising.
The ordinary shares have full voting rights.
27. share options On 19 January 2007 75,000 ordinary shares of 1 were granted by the EBT at the market price on that date of 25 per share.
These shares were exercised immediately at an exercise price of nil pence.
The total value of the grant was therefore 1,950,000 or 2,281,017.
On 21 May 2007 each ordinary share of 1 in the Capital of the Company was subdivided into 50 ordinary shares of 2 pence each.
On 17 December 2007 2,175,000 ordinary shares of 2 pence were granted by the EBT at the market price at that date of 130 pence per share.
These shares vest in three years on the condition that staff remain in the Groups employment for that period.
These options have an exercise price of nil pence.
None of these shares were forfeited or cancelled during the year.
28. cash flow statement The composition of cash positions, the general presentation of the Cash Flow Statement and the accounting option remain unchanged from the previous period.
The Cash Flow Statement was prepared in compliance with IAS 7.
The cash flow from operating activities is presented according to the indirect method.
Cash is defined as the balance of cash and cash equivalents.
All liabilities to banks are considered to be financial liabilities for purposes of the Cash Flow Statement.
Interest income is disclosed under cash flow from operating activities, while interest and dividend payments are recognised under cash flow from financing activities.
Tax payments are reported with their full amounts under operating activities, since it is practically impossible to allocate these payments to individual business segments.
52 PV Crystalox Solar PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2007 29. risk management and hedging strategies The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risks, interest rate risks, procurement risks, and exchange rate fluctuation risks.
The Board reviews and determines policies for managing each of these risks and are as such summarised below.
These policies have been consistently applied throughout the period.
CREDIT RISK The Groups principal financial assets are cash deposits and trade receivables.
The credit risk associated with cash is limited as the financial institutions involved have high credit ratings assigned by international creditrating agencies.
The main credit risk therefore arises from trade receivables.
All trade receivables are of a short term nature, with maximum payment terms of 150 days.
In order to manage credit risk, local management defines limits for customers based on a combination of payment history and customer reputation.
Credit limits are reviewed by local management on a regular basis.
As a supplier to some of the leading manufacturers of solar cells, the Group has a limited but increasing number of customers.
In 2007 48% of the sales are related to the largest customer 2006: 50%, who received a rating of A by Standard & Poors and A1 by Moodys.
The number of customers accounting for approximately 95% of the annual revenue increased from 15 in 2006 to 16 in 2007.
Where appropriate, the Group requests payment or partpayment in advance of shipment, which generally covers the cost of the goods.
Different forms of retention of title are used as securing means depending on local restrictions prevalent on the respective markets.
EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION RISKS A large portion of sales revenue is invoiced in foreign currency, potentially exposing the Group to exchange rate risks.
In the financial year 2007, about 163.5 million 2006: 162.4 million of the Groups sales was generated in JPY.
Expenses of 125.2 million 2006: 126.3 million invoiced in JPY were allocated to cost of materials.
Significant cash funds are denominated in currencies other than the presentational currency of the Group.
Excess cash funds not needed for local sourcing are exposed to exchange rate and associated interest fluctuation risks, particularly so in the UK.
The Group sells its products in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen and Euros and to a lesser extent US Dollars and also purchases in a number of currencies mainly Japanese Yen, Euros, Pounds Sterling and US Dollars.
The Group is largely naturally hedged because it buys a significant proportion of its raw materials in Japanese Yen and Euros, operates its wafering factory within the Eurozone and pays for the subcontracting of wafer production in Japan in Japanese Yen.
However, the ingot manufacturing operation is within the UK and therefore part of Group costs are in Pounds Sterling.
The exchange rate risk is predominantly in the UK in respect of balances held in Euros and Yen.
However, in addition to its natural hedging position, the Group is able to further mitigate currency risk by utilising surplus Yen to repay Group loans held in Japan and to allocate surplus Euros to capital investment in the new polysilicon project at Bitterfeld in Germany.
After careful consideration and due to the satisfactory natural hedging position, the directors have adopted a longterm policy of settingoff any downside risks of currency fluctuation against the associated upside risks.
During 2007 the Japanese Yen Euro exchange rate declined 5.22% 2006: 12.82%.
The impact of this decline on the Income Statement was to reduce sales revenues by approximately 4% 2006: 8.97% and to reduce operating profit EBIT by approximately 0.8% 2006: 1.99%.
During 2007 the net gain on foreign currency adjustments was a gain of 1.9 million 2006: loss of 1.6 million.
INTEREST FLUCTUATION RISKS The Group is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risks, since the Groups loan agreements largely are subject to variable interest rates.
In Japan swaps have been used to a small extent to hedge against these risks.
All variable interest rate loans are of a shortterm nature with a maturity of less than twelve months and part of credit lines that expire at the latest in September 2008.
The vast majority of borrowings 39,536,683 99.8% at the end of 2007 are in Japanese Yen 2006: 96.4%.
Accordingly, there is a downside risk that Japanese Yen interest rates may increase substantially from the current low levels.
However, the Group has a regular strong Japanese Yen income, sufficient to repay the loans if Group management wished to do so within a twelve month time scale.
On 31 December 2007 the Group had borrowings in Japanese Yen of 39.5 million 2006: 53.1 million at an average interest rate of approximately 1.5% 2006: 1.5%.
For each 1% rise in the Japanese Yen interest rates Group interest costs would increase by approximately 400,000 2006: 530,000 and for each 1% fall in the Japanese Yen interest rates interest costs would fall by approximately 400,000 2006: 530,000.
Accordingly, Group profits and equity would fall or rise after corporation tax in Japan by approximately 200,000 2006: 265,000.
Further sensitivity analysis of the accruals and loans outstanding at year end has not been disclosed as they are virtually all current and paid in line with standard payment terms.

No material litigation or risks from violation of third parties rights or laws that could materialise in 2007 are pending at the current time.
32. other financial oBligations LEASE AGREEMENTS OPERATING LEASES The leases primarily relate to rented buildings and have terms of no more than eight years.

33. related party disclosures The Group basically defines related parties as the senior executives of the Group and also companies that these persons could have a material influence on as related parties.
