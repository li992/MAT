In 2006, goodwill recognised on acquisition of subsidiaries includes 386 million arising from the acquisition of the remaining 55% of the Groups former associate CSBG, 37 million relating to the acquisition of a further 30% share in the Groups Turkish subsidiary Kent Gida, 23 million relating to other smaller bottling group acquisitions in the US and 15 million relating to the goodwill arising on the further acquisition of shares in the Groups former associate Cadbury Nigeria as well as the existing associate goodwill.
The impairment charge recognised in 2007 relates to the Groups business in China.
The Groups strategy relating to China was revised in the first half of 2007 with a change in focus to concentrate on key brands and streamline the distribution network which led to the impairment of goodwill historically recognised.
The impairment charge recognised in 2006 relates to Cadbury Nigeria.
Cadbury Nigeria has been identified as a separate cash generating unit and in 2006 was part of the BIMA reporting segment.
Following acquisition it was discovered that the financial results and position of Cadbury Nigeria had been significantly overstated.
A valuation of the business was undertaken by the Group once the full extent of the financial position was established.
This indicated a value for Cadbury Nigeria as at 31 December 2006 which required the impairment of the entire goodwill balance of 15 million.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
