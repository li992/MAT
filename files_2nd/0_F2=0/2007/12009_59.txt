RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a number of pension schemes including a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustees of the funds are required to act in the best interest of the funds beneficiaries.
The appointment of schemes trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation.
The Group has a policy that one-half of all trustees other than the Chairman are nominated by members of the fund, including current pensioners.

RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The expected return on plan assets is determined by considering the long-term returns and the balance between risk and reward on the various categories of investment assets held.
Expected returns on equity and property investments reflect long-term rates of return experienced in the respective markets.
Expected yields on fixed interest investments are based on gross redemption yields as at the balance sheet date.
In conjunction with the trustees and investment advisers, the Group has restructured its portfolio of defined benefit pension investments during the year following a review of strategy.
This led to a new asset allocation structure with the objective of increasing investment returns whilst reducing risk.
The revised asset allocation has three main elements: an increased holding of bonds which are expected to be less volatile than most other asset classes and are a better match for the schemes liabilities a reduction in the proportion of equities, but with fund managers having more freedom in making investment decisions to maximise returns investment of a relatively small proportion of the schemes assets circa 10% in alternative asset classes which give the potential for gaining higher returns property and currency.
Equities held by the scheme are spread between the UK circa 55% and international markets circa 45% excluding emerging markets.
The Group provides retirement benefits to some of its former and approximately 54% of current employees through defined benefit schemes.
The level of retirement benefit is principally based on final annual salary earned in employment.
The liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are measured by using the projected unit credit method which is an accrued benefits valuation method in which the scheme liabilities make allowance for projected earnings.
An alternative method of valuation to the projected unit credit method is a solvency basis which is estimated using the cost of buying out benefits with a suitable insurer.
This amount represents the amount that would be required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the on-going liabilities.
The Group estimates the amount required to settle the schemes liabilities at the balance sheet date was 549 million.
