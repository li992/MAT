RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS continued The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Groups defined benefit schemes was carried out as at 1 April 2004.
The Groups current service cost has increased from 11.5% of pensionable earnings in 2004 05 to 21.7% in 2006 07.
On 1 April 2006 the existing schemes were closed to new entrants replaced by a new scheme with reduced benefits and contribution rates for most employees were increased from 5% to 7%.
In August 2005 a prepayment of Group regular pension contributions to March 2010 of 44.2 million was made.
A further 8.6 million prepayment was made in September 2006.
As a result of these prepayments no further Group regular contributions are expected to be paid to the schemes during the year ending 31 March 2008.
The Group has agreed with the trustees that it will aim to eliminate the actuarially calculated on-going funding deficit of circa 59 million as at 31 March 2004 over the remaining service life of scheme members, which is expected to be circa 13 years.
The Group monitors funding levels on an annual basis and a further formal review will be undertaken following the results of the next triennial valuation, as at 1 April 2007.
Contribution levels are based on the current service costs and the expected future cash flows of the defined benefit schemes.
The cash flows arising from the payment of the defined benefits contained in the April 2004 actuarial valuation are expected to be settled from that date as shown in the graph below: 30.0 25.0 20.0 15.0 10.0 5.0 16 11 16 21 26 31 36 41 46 51 56 61 66 71 Years 29.
