Financial risk Risk management objectives and risk policies The Group adopts a risk averse approach to financial risk with a stated policy of not actively pursuing and accepting financial risk except when necessary to support other objectives.
The Group seeks to manage risk through the operation of unit linked business whereby the policyholder bears the financial risk.
In addition, shareholder assets are invested in highly rated investments.
The Groups exposure to credit, liquidity and market risks is set out below in the following paragraphs.
The process for accepting, measuring, monitoring and controlling these risks is set out in the Groups Risk Management Framework, which is described on pages 42 to 45 of the Corporate Governance Report.
Categories of financial assets and financial liabilities The categories and carrying values of the financial assets and financial liabilities held in the Groups balance sheet are summarised in the table below: 31 December 200 7 31 December 2006 Financial Loans and Financial Financial Financial Loans and Financial Financial assets at receivables liabilities at liabilities assets at receivables liabilities at liabilities fair value fair value measured fair value fair value measured through through at through through at profit and profit and amortised profit and profit and amortised loss loss cost loss loss cost Million Million Million Million Million Million Million Million Financial Assets Equities 10,780.4 9,014.5 Fixed income securities 720.7 595.2 Investment in Collective Investment Schemes 1,098.8 963.9 Currency forwards - 0.2 Other receivables St. Jamess Place Partnership loans 41.4 16.9 Deferred LAHC proceeds - 3.9 Other 118.8 66.3 Total other receivables 160.2 87.1 Cash & cash equivalents 1,929.2 1,606.9 Total Financial Assets 14,529.1 160.2 12,180.7 87.1 Financial Liabilities Investment contract benefits 14,144.0 11,819.8 Borrowings 11.2 13.1 Currency forwards 0.2 0.1 Other payables 119.4 100.5 Total Financial Liabilities 14,144.2 130.6 11,819.9 113.6 All financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such upon initial recognition.

This is as a result of the variable maturity values of the financial liabilities as a consequence of future policyholder investments and withdrawals as well as investment return.
The contractual value required to be paid to the policyholder as at 31 December 2007 would not be materially different from the investment contract benefits value in the table on the previous page.
Income, expense, gains and losses arising from financial assets and financial liabilities The income, expense, gains and losses arising from financial assets and financial liabilities are summarised in the table below: 31 December 200 7 31 December 2006 Financial Loans and Financial Financial Financial Loans and Financial Financial assets at receivables liabilities at liabilities assets at receivables liabilities at liabilities fair value fair value measured fair value fair value measured through through at through through at profit and profit and amortised profit and profit and amortised loss loss cost loss loss cost Million Million Million Million Million Million Million Million Financial Assets Unit linked assets 1,065.9 1,506.8 Fixed income securities 1.7 0.2 Investment in Collective Investment Schemes 11.7 6.3 Other receivables St. Jamess Place Partnership loans 2.6 2.2 Deferred LAHC proceeds 0.3 0.4 Other - - Total other receivables 2.9 2.6 Cash & cash equivalents 4.6 5.3 Financial Liabilities Investment contract benefits 697.1 1,139.3 Borrowings - - Other payables - - All financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss are designated as such upon initial recognition.

Shareholders funds are invested in AAA rated unitised money market funds and deposits with approved banks, in accordance with the SJP Group Credit Policy, with a view to minimising credit and market risk.
Maximum counterparty limits are set for each company within the Group and aggregate limits are also set at a Group level.
Non-linked liabilities are matched by fixed interest securities with minimum AA credit ratings: maximum counterparty limits are again set for each company within the Group and at an aggregate Group level.
Reinsurance credit risk is managed in accordance with the Groups Reinsurance Policy with credit ratings of potential reinsurers required to meet or exceed minimum specified levels.
Consideration is also given to size, risk concentrations exposures and ownership in the selection of reinsurers.
The Group also seeks to diversify its reinsurance credit risk through the use of a range of reinsurers.
The amount due from reinsurers relates primarily to one AA-rated reinsurer, as set out in the credit risk table opposite.
The Group is actively seeking to minimise this concentration of credit risk.
The Groups exposure to credit risk from financial support to the Partnership is managed through securing lending on future commission streams or business values, coupled with the application of monetary limits on the amounts lent to individual Partners.
No other form of collateral is held as security.
Quantification of the collateral held against those loans to the Partnership that have been impaired is calculated on a statistical basis and hence individual Partner income streams that might be associated with the impaired balances cannot be identified with sufficient certainty.

Financial assets that are either past due or impaired Loans to St. Jamess Place Partnership disclosed in the tables above are shown net of an impairment provision of 7.0 million 2006: 6.9 million.
The amount of the impairment loss recognised in the income statement was 0.1 million 2006: gain 1.0 million.
The factors considered in determining the impairment include default history, the nature or type of the Partner loan, exposure levels to individual Partners and whether the individual Partner is active or has left.
There are no other financial assets that are materially impaired, would otherwise be past due or impaired whose terms have been renegotiated or are past due but not impaired.
Liquidity risk The Group is subject to minimal liquidity risk since it maintains a high level of liquid assets to meet its liabilities.
The analysis of contractual maturities for the Groups financial liabilities is included within the table in the section which follows.
Market risk In order to limit the exposure of the Group to market risk, the majority of the Groups business is unit linked, for which policyholders carry the financial risk.
This removes any risk associated with being able to meet policyholders liabilities.
However, a reduction in the market value of the unit linked funds would affect the annual management charges accruing to the Group, since these charges are based on the market value of funds under management.
The associated reduction in dividends could also result in the deferral of tax relief on UK life business expenses and indirectly could also be associated with a reduction in the volume of new business sales.
Currency risk The Group is not subject to any significant currency risk since all material financial assets and financial liabilities are denominated in Sterling.

Financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds primarily consist of fixed interest securities, units in money market funds, cash and cash equivalents, and other assets and liabilities.
The fixed interest securities are held to match non linked liabilities and the liability values move broadly in line with the matching asset values such that fair value interest rate risk is immaterial, although these is some residual risk due to imperfect matching.
Cash held in unitised money market funds and at bank is valued at par and is unaffected by movement in interest rates.
Other assets and liabilities are similarly unaffected by market movements.
As a result of these combined factors, the Groups financial assets and liabilities held outside unitised funds are not materially subject to market risk, and movements in interest rates and equity values have an immaterial impact on the Groups profit after tax and equity.
